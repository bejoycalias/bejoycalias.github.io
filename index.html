			<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">
			During the past many years of my IT career I have come across situations where I couldn't find a straight forward document which explains what exactly to be done to achieve a specific requirement. As anybody else, I had to read multiple documents and consolidate those steps to complete what I was looking for. Some of those consolidated steps I have documented here for my reference, as well for others to refer if you are trying to do the same thing I already did. I have also uploaded other technical documents which I created during my career and few command references which I usually refer to. Hope this would be of help to someone, at least myself :)
