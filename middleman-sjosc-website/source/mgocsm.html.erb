				St. Joseph Church's Youth Movement started in May 2014. The members of the youth movement under the leadership of Mr. Ajit Alex and Mr. Roshan George used to meet on Sundays after the Holy Qurbana. In addition to organising various activities, they were also making arrangements for conducting the Holy Qurbana in the make shift environment and also helping the students from the neighbouring colleges to attend the Holy Qurbana.
