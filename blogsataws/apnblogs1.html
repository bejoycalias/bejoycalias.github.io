<p><em>By Christian Champagne, CEO at Blu Age</em></p> 
<p>Many organizations face mainframe challenges—decades-old mainframe-centric application portfolio is expensive, monolithic, rigid, and slow to evolve. Blu Age customers in sectors such as banking, insurance, and government built their IT based on mainframe technologies from the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. These systems were further complicated in the late 1990s and early 2000s by the addition of client/server layers to the mainframe core.</p> 
<p>The complexity of these architectures combined with the cost of removing technical debt helps explain why there are still hundreds of billions of lines of COBOL code being maintained today. It also helps explain why businesses are constrained and limited by their own legacy mainframes.</p> 
<p>Mainframes host valuable assets such as processes and rules, data that can fuel innovation, and core-business value—if only they are agile and lean enough. So how do you transform mainframe assets to suppress technical debt, cut costs, and remove inefficiencies? In other words: How do you migrate mainframe assets to Amazon Web Services (AWS) in order to combine both the value of core-business IT assets and the value of AWS?</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.blugenius.com/">Blu Genius</a> is a legacy-COBOL-to-Cloud portal powered by Blu Age Velocity. It automates the transformation from mainframe legacy languages, databases, and file-systems to agile service-oriented applications on AWS.</p> 
<p>With Blu Genius on AWS, customers and partners can:</p> 
<li>Transform COBOL programs to Java-based applications with Automated Refactoring</li> 
<li>Check the completeness of the candidate programs and data structures for refactoring</li> 
<li>Perform a Proof of Concept to validate the transformation and performance</li> 
<li>Experience various managed AWS&nbsp;services embedded in the target application</li> 
<li>Evaluate the financial estimate for transformation using online configurators</li> 
<li>Manage the code coverage of the test cases used to test functional equivalence</li> 
<li>Benefit from the combined best practices of AWS and Blu Age</li>

<b>Evaluating Mainframe Migration Options</b> 
<p>There are several mainframe migration options that can be evaluated based on speed, agility, cloud maturity, and business value.</p> 
<h3>Re-Host</h3> 
<p>Re-host uses an emulator to move, translate, and recompile legacy applications on AWS. It keeps the original COBOL code mostly intact, but it’s not a simple lift-and-shift. Rather, it’s a complex re-platforming project where the COBOL code is tailored to a permanent third-party emulator, and then adapted to many third-party utilities for output management, sorting, printing, data storage, and charge-back.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, re-host does not take advantage of micro-services, elasticity, or service-oriented languages like Java or .NET, and it cannot easily integrate with cloud-native applications or AWS services for big data analytics, artificial intelligence, or mobile enablement. This type of transformation can reduce operating expenses but is best suited if legacy applications are close to the end of their product lifecycle.</p> 
<h3>Replace</h3> 
<p>Replace is an approach where the legacy mainframe application is replaced by commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software. Finding a COTS solution that covers 100% of an organization’s business needs is difficult, requiring an exhaustive list of requirements, use cases, and business rules. This typically leads to the development of custom code for equivalent functionality, similar to risky and time-consuming manual re-write projects.</p> 
<h3>Re-Write</h3> 
<p>Re-write refers to the manual redevelopment of legacy code in a newer language, and it’s not easy because of the need to retroactively specify all software requirements. It’s difficult to certify the completeness and accuracy of the retroactive specification, making like-for-like testing nearly impossible. Furthermore, legacy mainframe applications, especially COBOL batch processes, are designed to make the most out of scarce compute resources, requiring deep technical knowledge and appropriate tooling. A manual rewrite can take many years to complete, increasing risk and reducing the overall business value proposition.</p> 
<b>Automated Refactoring</b> 
<p>Automated refactoring addresses an organization’s need for speed, accuracy, and agility of the transformed application. This process extracts the application model from the source code and refactors the model to the desired target architecture, forward-generating new object- and service-oriented code. The new code eliminates technical debt, taking advantage of popular application frameworks such as Angular and SpringBoot combined with AWS-managed services such as Amazon Aurora, Amazon ElastiCache, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.</p> 
<p>Typically, the resulting architecture of an automated refactoring effort executes on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances or Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) containers. Data can be hosted by Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) and Amazon Aurora for both relational database managers (DB2 z/OS, Datacom) and modernized legacy file-based data store (VSAM, SEQ).</p> 
<p>Elastic Beanstalk can automatically manage capacity provisioning, load balancing, and automatic scaling of compute instances. Mainframe in-memory distributed data structures can be stored in Amazon ElastiCache, and after automated refactoring the resulting micro-services are accessible directly via the Elastic Load Balancer. They can also be accessed asynchronously via Amazon SQS or as an Application Programing Interface (API) via Amazon API Gateway. The mainframe batch programs can be submitted and dispatched with AWS Batch.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 1 – Mainframe Automated Refactoring on AWS.</em></p> 
<p>Automated refactoring is agile with a flexible automation process, creating a customizable AWS cloud-native application architecture. It’s modern because generated code leverages popular frameworks such as Angular and SpringBoot. It’s versatile with a large variety of legacy languages such as COBOL or PL/1 transformed into desired AWS-ready Java. It’s simple, as no prior knowledge of legacy languages is required. It produces quality code and maintainable code with measurable metrics. And it’s fast with automated refactoring being much quicker than a traditional manual re-write and about as fast as COBOL emulator re-host projects.</p> 
<h3>How Blu Age Empowers Automated Refactoring</h3> 
<p>Blu Age Automated Refactoring software extracts all functional features and business rules from the legacy mainframe source code and rewrites them automatically in digital- and cloud-ready architecture. It also includes data and database migration for continuous testing.</p> 
<p>Blu Age Analyzer creates an application model from the source code, facilitates the allotment for the modernization project, and allows for planning phases and budget. It collects and analyzes information from the source code assets, data structures, use cases, and functional interdependencies. It provides various graphics and tables that present program calls, control flows, dependencies, metrics, optimization suggestions of the legacy source code, and data structure in order to simplify maintenance and improve performance.</p> 
<p>Based on actual dependency analysis, Blu Age Analyzer decomposes applications into subsystems to solve inter-programs dependencies as well as deployment data dependencies. This assessment of the legacy portfolio provides key elements for understanding the modernization scenarios. It enables a complete screening of the legacy applications to accelerate and secure modernization projects.</p> 
<p>Blu Age Velocity expedites automated refactoring and lowers the cost with a pre-selected target software stack based on Java, AngularJS, SpringBoot, Spring Statemachine, and REST APIs. All transformation options are calculated in advance and driven by Blu Age Analyzer.</p> 
<h3>Automated Refactoring with Blu Age Velocity involves the following steps:</h3> 
<ol> 
<li>Import legacy code in Blu Age Analyzer and tag programs and data structure to define relevant work packages.</li> 
<li>Export tagged artifacts to Blu Age PLTC (COBOL 2 SpringBoot) to extract functional specifications from the work packages to UML models. Generate Angular/SpringBoot base code from UML models. Package Java code using Maven and NPM.</li> 
<li>Export legacy data to the modernized data structure and load it on the targeted database such as Amazon Aurora.</li> 
<li>Deploy the packaged applications on the desired AWS services. Run functional tests for acceptance. Check code base compliance to the requested quality rating.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Steps 2 to 4 are fully automated and can be integrated within a DevOps pipeline with Blu Age Velocity silent version. This automated transformation guarantees functional equivalence even for complex Mainframe batch processes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<b>Customer Benefits</b> 
<p>Customers benefit from COBOL applications being transformed by Blu Age automation into cloud-native applications in as little as 6-8 months (SIT and UAT included). The Blu Age Velocity platform accelerates the conversion even further; on average, 1 million lines of COBOL code can be transformed and tested in one month. Prices range from $0.10 to $2.00 per LoC utilizing onshore resources, depending on architecture, language, and scope of services.</p> 
<p>Blu Age software produces code with high development quality standards, which can be measured daily using SonarQube or CAST software, and which can be maintained without the use of Blu Age tools. Blu Age’s high level of automation allows the adoption of DevOps Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines and a more rapid integration with AWS services.</p> 
<p>Because the legacy design is transformed into modern language service-oriented code on AWS, customers also benefit&nbsp;by eliminating technical debt being, allowing mobile-friendly web interfaces to improve user experience, leveraging AWS elasticity, and replacing&nbsp;mainframe capital expenditures&nbsp;with pay-as-you-go operating expenses.</p>

<p>Onica joined the AWS Partner Network (APN) in 2013 and quickly became a Premier Consulting Partner. The company has since completed more than 400 AWS engagements and now boasts over 150 AWS certifications with customers spending more than $100 million a year on the cloud.</p> 
<p>Customers like TrueCar have <a href="https://www.onica.com/case-study/truecar/">migrated critical systems to AWS</a> in a matter of months with the help of Onica’s consultants—while driving down costs with a pay-as-you-go infrastructure rather than owning, operating, and maintaining their own data centers.</p> 
<p>“We needed outside experts to help us build the cloud platform we wanted to build, and Onica was the right choice,” said David Giffin, SVP of Technology at TrueCar. “We had developers and engineers from Onica in our office working side-by-side with our teams to help us learn and understand how to leverage the AWS ecosystem.”</p> 
<p>Onica is led by CEO Stephen Garden, who transformed CorpInfo from a legacy consulting company into an industry-leading cloud advisory firm. Onica has been a regular on the Inc. 5000 list of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies and in 2017 was named a CRN Triple Crown Award Winner.</p> 
<p>“The CorpInfo-Onica story is a great example of how an APN Partner is accelerating cloud adoption for our customers,” says Terry Wise, AWS Global Vice President of Channels and Alliances. “The new company reflects the team’s single-minded focus on helping customers succeed on AWS.”</p>

<p>An update to the <a href="http://amzn.to/2jM035X">NGINX Plus on AWS Quick Start</a>&nbsp;includes full support for handling Auto Scaling events on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).&nbsp;We are pleased to&nbsp;share that staff from AWS Partner Network (APN) Partner NGINX, Inc., and Solutions Architects from Amazon Web Services (AWS) collaborated on the update.</p> 
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2jM035X">See the NGINX Plus on AWS Quick Start &gt;&gt;</a></p> 
<p>The NGINX Plus on AWS Quick Start uses customizable AWS CloudFormation templates to automate design, configuration, and setup tasks, and deploys NGINX Plus on AWS in less than 30 minutes. It’s designed to kick-start application migrations by deploying a turn-key NGINX Plus application delivery infrastructure.</p> 
<p>The updated AWS Quick Start enables you to spin up an entire NGINX Plus load-balancing and application delivery infrastructure with minimal effort, and demonstrates best practices when using NGINX Plus to manage application traffic on AWS.</p> 
<p>The update includes the following features:</p> 
<li>Nginx-asg-sync integration software, which monitors Auto Scaling groups, and adds or removes web application instances as necessary from the NGINX Plus environment, based on your configured settings</li> 
<li>Auto Scaling groups for the NGINX Plus instances, with configurable desired capacity, minimum size, and maximum size settings</li> 
<li>Auto Scaling groups for the NGINX web applications, with configurable desired capacity, minimum size, and maximum size settings</li> 
<li>Support for Auto Scaling policies for the NGINX Plus instances</li> 
<li>Infrastructure improvements, including Linux bastion hosts in an Auto Scaling group and enhanced AWS Quick Start portability</li> 
<p>While some features for Auto Scaling front-end traffic are available only in NGINX Plus, we have demonstrated in the AWS Quick Start how to manage application scaling with minimal cost by utilizing custom-built NGINX OSS images as the application images.</p> 
<p>This AWS Quick Start utilizes Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for NGINX Plus. Users will need to subscribe to the AMI before deploying the Quick Start.</p> 
<p>Get started by deploying the <a href="http://amzn.to/2jM035X">NGINX Plus on AWS Quick Start</a>, and see the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-reference/nginx/plus/latest/doc/nginx-plus-on-the-aws-cloud.pdf">Deployment Guide</a> for step-by-step instructions.</p>

<p>Here are some&nbsp;sessions that you can still register to attend at the Global Partner Summit. We’ll see you there!</p> 
<b>Business Sessions</b> 
<p><strong>Title: Cloud-Based Regtech Solutions on AWS</strong><br /> <strong>Session</strong> ID: GPSBUS209<br /> <strong>What You’ll Learn:&nbsp;</strong>With recent reports that banks face a regulatory change every 12 minutes, it’s no wonder firms increasingly look to automate compliance and reduce operational risk. By leveraging the latest technology advances—including cognitive computing, enhanced analytics, digital identities, big data, and the cloud—banks hope to reduce their compliance burdens and free human and financial capital for more productive uses. Today’s cutting-edge approaches offer advantages for agility, speed, and ease of integration. We dive deeper into the cloud-based RegTech solutions that are available on AWS.</p> 
<p><strong>Title: Evolve Your Storage Business Models on AWS</strong><br /> <strong>Session ID:</strong> GPSBUS217<br /> <strong>What You’ll Learn:&nbsp;</strong>Transitioning on-premises solutions to the cloud and creating SaaS solutions is no small undertaking. Providing unique, differentiated value, adjusting business models, and adroitly messaging your cloud-enabled solutions can set you up for long-term success. We’ll discuss the opportunities ahead for storage partners on AWS. How do you transform solutions to leverage the power of the AWS cloud? Will your operational paradigms shift as your customer deployment scenarios change? Can you help and advise customers as they navigate their own cloud transitions? Hear from on-premises and born-in-the-cloud partners as they discuss transforming their businesses on AWS.</p> 
<p><strong>Title: Refactor and Replatform .NET Apps to Use the Latest Microsoft SQL Server Release on AWS and Beyond</strong><br /> <strong>Session ID:</strong> GPSBUS220<br /> <strong>What You’ll Learn:&nbsp;</strong>Developers and architects migrating Microsoft enterprise applications to AWS can leverage new tools and services to implement DevOps best practices identified and developed by AWS solution architects and service teams. Learn about architectural best practices and AWS services such as AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodeDeploy, focusing on the .NET environment. Get examples of using the latest Microsoft SQL Server release on Amazon EC2 or Amazon RDS, or on other database offerings native to AWS such as Amazon Aurora or serverless environments. Hear how an APN Partner took a global retail customer’s e-commerce engine and Microsoft SQL Server-based data platform from on premises to the AWS Cloud in just weeks.</p> 
<p><strong>Title: Maximize Innovation and Agility by Building Your SaaS Solution on AWS</strong><br /> <strong>Session ID:</strong> GPSBUS215<br /> <strong>What You’ll Learn:&nbsp;</strong>Partners increasingly look to a SaaS delivery model for products to respond to customer demand, improve operational efficiency, increase agility, and expand market and global reach. AWS provides a low-cost, reliable, and secure foundation as you build and deliver SaaS solutions to customers. The AWS Partner Network (APN) helps you build a successful AWS-based business by providing valuable business, technical, marketing, and go-to-market support. We discuss what a typical journey to SaaS on AWS looks like, and explore the AWS and APN resources and benefits available to you at every stage of your journey.</p> 
<b>Technical Sessions</b> 
<p><strong>Title: SaaS Metrics: The Ultimate View of Tenant Consumption</strong><br /> <strong>Session ID:</strong> GPSTEC308<br /> <strong>What You’ll Learn:&nbsp;</strong>SaaS architects have their fingers on the pulse of tenant consumption. Understanding the patterns for tenant consumption provides both business and technical teams the data they need to make sound decisions about product packaging, metering, and tiering. Of course, building a robust model for analyzing and attributing tenant consumption can be tricky. We look at specific strategies for capturing, aggregating, and associating consumption with tenants in a multi-tenant, shared resource model. We’ll touch on common patterns and strategies that are used to instrument and publish metrics spanning compute, storage, and more, and we’ll look at tools and models that correlate consumption with AWS spend.</p> 
<p><strong>Title: Image Management Best Practices for Amazon WorkSpaces</strong><br /> <strong>Session ID:</strong> GPSTEC316<br /> <strong>What You’ll Learn:&nbsp;</strong>Desktop and application streaming solutions provide the “last mile” between users and their applications and data. We will review the elements and benefits of the layered desktop image, application dependencies, and lifecycle management of desktops. APN Partner Liquidware will showcase its toolset that helps customers deploy on AWS with ease. This deep dive on desktop image management for Amazon WorkSpaces will focus on enterprise organizations migrating to the cloud. It will benefit engineers and system administrators that are new to this space, as well as experienced architects with existing deployments on AWS.</p> 
<p><strong>Title: From Leaves to Lawns: AWS Greengrass at the Edge and Beyond</strong><br /> <strong>Session ID:</strong> GPSTEC317<br /> <strong>What You’ll Learn:&nbsp;</strong>AWS Greengrass provides a wide range of opportunities from IoT gateway applications to building systems like those with microservice architectures. We’ll evaluate how AWS Greengrass fits into OEM, ODM, and IT service delivery models. We then wade into a gentle overview of AWS Greengrass and how it interoperates with AWS IoT and other AWS services. We’ll walk through several key AWS Greengrass distributed architectures, and to help you accelerate your solution&nbsp;we’ll discuss how AWS Greengrass fits into the AWS Cloud development and delivery model. The session wraps up with a demonstration of AWS Greengrass facilitating communication between a closed machine to machine (M2M) network and AWS IoT.</p> 
<p><strong>Title: Optimizing Tips: Amazon Redshift for Cloud Data Warehousing</strong><br /> <strong>Session ID:</strong> GPSTEC315<br /> <strong>What You’ll Learn:&nbsp;</strong>Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud. A proper data model is an integral part of an optimal Amazon Redshift deployment, allowing you to scale efficiently in a cost-effective manner to meet your increasing demand. We offer tips to help you optimize your Amazon Redshift deployment.</p> 
<p><strong>Title: SAP HANA HA on AWS: Preventing Production Facepalms</strong><br /> <strong>Session ID:</strong> GPSTEC312<br /> <strong>What You’ll Learn:&nbsp;</strong>AWS provides a suite of services and tools to deploy business-critical SAP HANA workloads on the AWS Cloud. We discuss how to use AWS services, native SAP HANA high availability (HA) tools, and third-party software to achieve HA for SAP HANA systems on the AWS Cloud. We’ll review multiple options that use different AWS features, Availability Zones, and global regions, and then discuss the pros, cons, and related costs of each option.</p>

<p><strong><em>By Tom Staab, Partner Solutions Architect at AWS</em></strong></p> 
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5309" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/14/Microsoft-Competency-Icon-1-300x150.png" alt="Microsoft Competency Icon" width="300" height="150" />This past week in Seattle, more than 5,000 people attended the annual PASS Summit conference, and AWS was well represented. Once again, AWS had a large booth in the exhibit hall, and hundreds of people stopped by over the three-day event. Several technical sessions provided insight for running Microsoft SQL Server workloads on Amazon Web Services (AWS), and the AWS Partner Network (APN) co-sponsored a breakfast with over 150 attendees.</p> 
<p>You may have read in Jeff Barr’s recent article on the AWS News Blog that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-microsoft-sql-server-2017-for-amazon-ec2/">Microsoft launched its SQL Server 2017</a>, which then became available on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in all regions shortly after. That means the latest version of Microsoft SQL Server is now available with the security, scalability, performance, and flexibility of Amazon EC2.</p> 
<p>Running Microsoft SQL Server 2017 on AWS enables you to benefit from its new features such as graph databases, automatic database tuning, and clusterless Always On availability groups. All of this while leveraging the high availability and disaster recovery capabilities of AWS with low latency connectivity between all AWS Availability Zones (AZs) .</p> 
<p>This is just one example of the many innovations that help customers run Microsoft SQL Server workloads on AWS. In May, AWS released a new Quick Start featuring <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/sios-datakeeper/">SIOS DataKeeper Cluster Edition</a> from Advanced APN Technology Partner SIOS, making it even easier to implement Microsoft SQL Server failover cluster instances on Amazon EC2. In August, the maximum storage capacity for Amazon Relationship Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances running Microsoft SQL Server was increased from 4 TB to 16 TB, and the potential IOPS was increased fivefold. And just last week, Amazon RDS for Microsoft SQL Server gained the ability to reconfigure the volume type and Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) upon snapshot restore.</p> 
<p>All Microsoft SQL Server versions integrate with AWS services including <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">Amazon CloudWatch</a> (to monitor operations and performance), <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/run-command/">Amazon EC2 Run Command</a> (to remotely manage instances), and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/">Amazon Elastic Block Store</a> (to take advantage of the persistent, performance, and reliable storage). This helps provide you with easy management, monitoring, and other administrative tasks.</p> 
<h3>Learn More About Microsoft SQL Server on AWS</h3> 
<p>For more information on how AWS services contribute to improved performance, security, and availability of Microsoft SQL Server applications, we invite you to join us at our <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/">AWS re:Invent 2017 conference</a>, November 27 through December 1 in Las Vegas.</p> 
<h3>Leveraging the AWS Competency Program for Microsoft Workloads</h3> 
<p>In July, we announced Microsoft SQL Server will be represented in a new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/aws-microsoft-workloads-competency-now-includes-database-solutions/">Database Solutions category</a> of our AWS Microsoft Workloads Competency. This allows customers to easily identify and engage the right APN Partners.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/">AWS Competency Program</a> is valuable to APN Partners as a way to demonstrate proficiency, and it is an important vehicle for customers to find APN Partners with the knowledge and experience they need. There are currently 12 APN Partners in the Microsoft Workloads Competency Database Solutions category, and several others have begun the approval process.</p> 
<p>We appreciate the dedication and hard work of our Microsoft Workloads Competency APN Partners and continue to look for Advanced and Premier APN Partners with experience implementing Microsoft SQL Server on AWS to join this elite group. Check out the AWS Microsoft Workloads Competency site&nbsp;if you are a customer or APN Partner looking to work with an APN Partner who has already earned the competency.</p> 
<h3>Proven Success with Microsoft SQL Server Workloads</h3> 
<p>The new&nbsp;Microsoft SQL Server launch means customers will be considering upgrades, and APN Partners that have earned the competency play an important role in helping you with these projects.</p> 
<p>In their own words, here are some success stories from APN Partners who have delivered Microsoft SQL projects:</p> 
<h4>Cascadeo</h4> 
<p>“Scaling database systems like MSSQL is notoriously challenging and expensive work. AWS makes it possible to radically simplify the deployment, operation, monitoring, and scaling of MSSQL while still allowing the flexibility to manage complex configurations and support legacy applications. In short, MSSQL on AWS is an order-of-magnitude improvement relative to yesterday’s approach.” – <strong>Jared Reimer, CTO at Cascadeo</strong></p>
