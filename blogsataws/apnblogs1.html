<b class="lb-b blog-post-title" property="name headline">Customer Satisfaction Data is Now Available for APN Partners</b> 
<p style="margin: 0; padding:0;">=======================<p>
<p><em>By Ian Kirkwood, APN CSAT Program Manager at AWS</em></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/03/28/Rate-This-Partner-Button.jpg">AWS Partner Solutions Finder</a> last year.</p> 
<p>The APN Customer Satisfaction program (APN CSAT) provides Partners with meaningful data that you can use to better understand&nbsp;your customers. The program asks AWS customers how likely they are to recommend an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/">AWS Partner Network</a> (APN) Partner on a scale of 0-10. By maximizing the number of satisfied customers and decreasing the overall amount of dissatisfied customers,&nbsp;you can increase customer retention and grow your&nbsp;business.</p> 
<p>In short, APN CSAT data provides:</p> 
<li>A system to evaluate, monitor, and improve customer loyalty and satisfaction</li> 
<li>Deeper understanding of how AWS customers view a business and the reasons why</li> 
<li>Opportunities to repair customer relationships after a negative experience</li> 
<p>For more information, please see the <a href="https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/sfc/#version?selectedDocumentId=0690L000004dgea">CSAT Program Overview</a> presentation in Partner Central. (Login Required)</p> 
<b>What’s in it for APN Partners?</b> 
<p>The goal of the APN CSAT program is not for Partners to get a perfect score. Rather,&nbsp;you should look to increase the percentage of satisfied customers while decreasing the number of dissatisfied ones who will share negative experiences with others. This data can help you understand where your organization measures up today, and that information can be key to deciding where you want your business to go tomorrow.</p> 
<b>Best Practices</b> 
<p>APN Customer Satisfaction data is a powerful tool that can change your business, but it requires a commitment to getting more feedback and reviewing your scores regularly. Here are some best practices for understanding APN CSAT data and using it to drive your business.</p> 
<h3>Ask Your APN Rep if You Have Customer Reviews Already</h3> 
<p>APN CSAT data is distributed to Partner Development Representatives (PDRs) for each APN Partner they manage that has <strong>acquired at least 10 customer reviews</strong>. This process ensures we have collected meaningful, actionable data that paints a realistic picture of your engagement with customers. One or two scores from customers, for example, does not likely represent the full scope of your work. This is why we require 10 reviews before sharing the information with PDRs.</p> 
<p>Please note that PDRs have already begun receiving this data, so contact your APN representative to see if there is data available for your organization.</p> 
<h3>Take Time to Understand Your Scores</h3> 
<p>APN CSAT data is divided into two elements: Customer Score and Comments.</p> 
<p>Our system gauges customer satisfaction and loyalty by asking customers to rate a Partner on a scale of 0-10:</p> 
<li>Scores of 9-10 denotes a&nbsp;Satisfied Customer</li> 
<li>Scores of 7-8 denotes a&nbsp;Neutral Customer</li> 
<li>Scores of 6 or below denotes a&nbsp;Dissatisfied Customer</li> 
<p>In aggregate, your Customer Score takes the total percentage of dissatisfied customers and subtracts that from the total percentage of satisfied customers. The final score&nbsp;is a number between -100 and 100. Neutral scores&nbsp;drive an overall Customer Score toward zero.</p> 
<p>The Customer Score in APN CSAT is calculated <strong>based on the</strong> <strong>trailing 12 months of data</strong>. This ensures your metrics are timely and allows you to recover from any negative customer experiences, over time, if&nbsp;you continue to&nbsp;generate&nbsp;new positive scores.</p> 
<h3>Follow Up with Customers Who Share Feedback</h3> 
<p>The other APN CSAT data&nbsp;you receive are the comments that accompany each Customer Score. Whereas the numerical score is a succinct and easy way for customers to communicate feedback with a Partner, the anecdotal details of their experience are equally important. Following up with reviews—positive or negative—is a great way to demonstrate to customers that you care about their experience and want to make a difference.</p> 
<p><strong>We ask customers’ permission</strong> <strong>each time</strong> they leave feedback if we can share their contact information with you. For some comments you will see a customer’s email address, whereas you won’t see contact information if they did not give us their consent to share it with you.</p> 
<p>If your organization receives a negative review and the customer indicates a process malfunction or poor customer experience, we recommend taking action and following up with the customer. By listening and responding to their needs, you may convert dissatisfied customers into&nbsp;satisfied ones&nbsp;and prevent future customers from having the same experience.</p> 
<h3>Solicit More Feedback From Customers</h3> 
<p>Partners can improve their scores by continually asking for feedback and improving in the areas customers have raised concerns about.</p> 
<p>All Partners were provided with a <strong>Customer Review solicitation email template</strong> at the end of March, which is also <a href="https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/sfc/#version?selectedDocumentId=0690L000004nybA">available in Partner Central</a>. Use this email template to drive traffic to your Customer Review form and increase the data pool your Customer Score draws from. The more data APN CSAT has, the more your score reflects your overall customer experience.</p> 
<p>We recommend&nbsp;you adopt a practice of <strong>regularly soliciting feedback from customers</strong>. You may ask for feedback when a business opportunity is finished, for example, or on a standard monthly or quarterly basis. Multiple individuals from the same customer organization are allowed to review Partners so long as each has had direct contact with you. Additionally, the same people are allowed to review a Partner for each business engagement they have.</p> 
<b>Next Steps</b> 
<p>Remember to ask your APN representative if you have customer reviews already, and that to unlock APN CSAT data you must have received at least 10 customer reviews. Once you can see and read your CSAT data, continue to solicit new reviews from customers.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/">AWS Partner Network</a> (APN) Partners helping customers migrate, manage, or deploy Microsoft Workloads to Amazon Web Services (AWS), we are introducing an Application Modernization category within the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/windows/partner-solutions/">AWS Microsoft Workloads Competency</a>, as well as the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/windows/products/ec2/partners/">Amazon EC2 for Windows Service Delivery</a> designation.</p> 
<p>APN Partners help customers build, deploy, scale, and manage Microsoft applications quickly, easily, more securely, and more cost-effectively. Both the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/">AWS Competency Program</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/service-delivery/">AWS Service Delivery Program</a> have validated that APN Partners have deep technical expertise and proven customer success in the Microsoft Workloads space.</p> 
<p>Our Microsoft Workloads Partners are an essential component in delivering the full AWS value to customers. Through their investment in developing a Windows on AWS practice, we know our customers will have an exceptional experience and the most efficient deployment running Windows applications on AWS.</p> 
<b>Introducing the Application Modernization Category</b> 
<p>Applications built on .NET framework are a great fit for the AWS platform. Customers start recognizing benefits just by moving applications onto AWS. From there, the benefits accelerate once the applications are modernized to integrate with and leverage AWS services and capabilities.</p> 
<p>APN Partners are a valuable asset in helping customers move and modernize their applications with minimum effort and resources.&nbsp;The new Application Modernization category identifies, validates, and promotes APN Partners that are highly specialized in migrating and/or building .NET-based applications on AWS. These Partners reduce the time to value for customers as they leverage their current investment and skill in .NET while modernizing applications to quickly realize the benefits of AWS.</p>

<b class="lb-b blog-post-title" property="name headline">Harnessing the Power of AWS for SAP Workloads with APN Partner Linke</b> 
<p style="margin: 0; padding:0;">=======================<p>
<p><em>By Francisco Javier Garcia Romero, Partner Solutions Architect at AWS</em></p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Linke&amp;id=001E000000UfZqMIAV"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/03/28/Linke_AWS-Solutions-300x150.jpg" /></a>The pace of adoption of Amazon Web Services (AWS) for enterprises’ core SAP workloads has been growing steadily the past few years. Already in 2018, we are seeing increased demand and interest for migration and deployment of SAP workloads on the AWS cloud.</p> 
<p>With <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Linke&amp;id=001E000000UfZqMIAV">Linke</a>, an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/">AWS Partner Network</a> (APN) Premier Consulting Partner&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/sap/">AWS SAP Competency</a>, enterprises can execute SAP-centric digital transformation strategies including new SAP deployments, database migrations to SAP HANA, or projects that integrate SAP systems with AWS services.</p> 
<b>Supporting Digital Transformation</b> 
<p>With AWS, enterprises find an ideal place to run their SAP workloads. AWS has a flexible and competitive cost model, global infrastructure, certifications for security and compliance, and self-provisioning capabilities to help you <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsforsap/getting-started-with-architecting-sap-on-the-aws-cloud/">get started with architecting SAP on AWS</a>.</p> 
<p>SAP also supports AWS for running most of its portfolio for production operations. AWS meets SAP’s high standards for its underlying infrastructure, as detailed in <a href="https://anibalg.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/note-1656099-sap-on-aws-supported-sap-dbos-and-aws-ec2-products.pdf">SAP Note 1656099</a> or in the number of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) instances <a href="https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/iaas.html">certified by SAP to run SAP HANA</a>, the organization’s in-memory database and a highly complex and technically challenging software.</p> 
<p>Linke executed 44 SAP migrations to AWS in 2017, and they currently manage more than 300 SAP instances on AWS with a team of engineers certified on both AWS and SAP. Such a unique blend of technical expertise makes Linke capable of understanding and optimizing AWS infrastructure and services to make SAP workloads work better.</p> 
<b>Linke’s Product Offerings</b> 
<p>Linke’s suite of products extend and optimize SAP workloads when running on AWS:</p> 
<li><strong>Elastic SAP</strong> is Linke proprietary technology that provides a set of tools to integrate automatic scaling with SAP Netweaver ABAP Application Server. It allows SAP application servers to automatically scale up or down horizontally. Elastic SAP also integrates with any <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">Amazon CloudWatch</a> metric to trigger automatic scaling. With Elastic SAP, you can optimize the underlying SAP infrastructure and give your business the flexibility to add or remove SAP servers based on need. At the same time, this solution allows to reduce operation and infrastructure costs by a significant amount.</li> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/03/28/Linke-Elastic-SAP.jpg" /></p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 1 – Scale your SAP infrastructure with real usage with Linke’s Elastic SAP solution.</em></p> 
<li><strong>AWS Connector for SAP</strong> is an ABAP add-on to SAP systems that integrates any SAP system with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (Amazon S3), following SAP Archivelink interface specifications.

<b class="lb-b blog-post-title" property="name headline">Securing and Managing Secrets with HashiCorp Vault Enterprise</b> 
<p style="margin: 0; padding:0;">=======================<p>
<p><em>By Trevor Hansen, Partner Solutions Architect at AWS</em><br /> <em><span style="color: #ffffff">By</span> Lance Larsen, Sr. Solutions Engineer at HashiCorp</em></p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=HashiCorp&amp;id=001E000001BxMyKIAV"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/04/04/HashiCorp_AWS-Solutions-300x150.jpg" /></a>Data security is a concern for all enterprises. Organizations often turn to dedicated hardware as a way to protect valuable information and secrets, but it becomes increasingly difficult to scale security as more infrastructure shifts to the cloud.</p> 
<p>HashiCorp’s <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/enterprise/index.html">Vault Enterprise</a> helps you achieve strong data security and scalability. Vault is a trusted secrets management tool designed to enable collaboration and governance across organizations. It enables developers, operators, and security professionals to deploy applications in zero-trust environments across public and private datacenters.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=HashiCorp&amp;id=001E000001BxMyKIAV">HashiCorp</a> is an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/">AWS Partner Network</a> (APN) Advanced Technology Partner with the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/partners/dev-ops/">AWS DevOps Competency</a>. In addition to Vault, they provide open source tools Vagrant, Packer, Terraform, Consul, and Nomad. Enterprise versions of Vault, Terraform, Consul, and Nomad enhance the open source tools with features that promote collaboration, governance, and multi-datacenter functionality.</p> 
<p><strong><a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">Learn more and get started with HashiCorp Vault Enterprise &gt;&gt;</a></strong></p> 
<b>Deep Integrations with AWS</b> 
<p>Vault has deep integrations with Amazon Web Services (AWS) in both open source and enterprise editions. Whether you are securely introducing applications and services with the <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws.html">AWS authentication method</a>, or providing human operators and applications with short-lived <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/aws/index.html">AWS secrets</a>, Vault is a powerful tool in your DevSecOps arsenal.</p> 
<p>Vault also integrates with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">AWS Key Management Service</a> (KMS) and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/">AWS CloudHSM</a> if you require single-tenant access to tamper-resistant hardware security models (HSMs) in your <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a> (VPC). With Vault, you can <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/databases/index.html">manage database credentials</a>, <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/pki/index.html">issue dynamic X.509 certificates</a>, <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/ssh/index.html">control SSH access</a>, and <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/index.html">much more</a>.</p> 
<b>Getting Started with Vault</b> 
<p>After <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/intro/getting-started/install.html">installing Vault</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/operator/init.html">initializing the solution</a>, two encryption keys are created—a data encryption key (DEK) and key encryption key (KEK), also known as the Master Key. The DEK creates the cryptographic barrier in Vault, and all data that flows between Vault and the storage backend passes through cryptographic barrier.</p> 
<p>This barrier guarantees that data written out to the storage backend for persistent storage is encrypted by the DEK. When Vault needs to pull data back in from the storage backend, the data is verified and decrypted by the DEK on the way back in.</p> 
<p>This DEK is stored in the backend for persistent storage, along with all of the other data that left Vault’s cryptographic barrier. The DEK is encrypted by the Master Key. When initializing Vault, you can specify a number of “key shares” that you want the Master&nbsp;Key to be split into. This is because you don’t want the keys to the kingdom to be in one person’s hands. Therefore, Vault splits the key into many key shares using an algorithm known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing">Shamir’s Secret Sharing</a>.</p> 
<p>Once the Master Key is split into ‘n’ number of key shares, you need ‘k’ of ‘n’ (‘k’ being the threshold) to reconstruct enough of the Master Key to decrypt the DEK from the storage backend and bring it into Vault’s memory. This is so the tool can manage the cryptographic barrier, and it’s a process known as “unsealing” Vault because you are unsealing the cryptographic barrier.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/04/04/HashiCorp-Vault-1.jpg" /></p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 1 – Protecting your Encryption Key with a Master Key, then splitting the Master Key into&nbsp;‘n’ shares.</em></p> 
<p>This process works quite well, but it can be challenging when you have many Vault clusters as there are now many different key holders with many different keys. Orchestrating the unsealing of a Vault node that happened to restart, for example, requires a lot of coordination and isn’t ideal in an automated world. For that reason, HashiCorp developed some ways to help you automate this process by leveraging AWS KMS.</p> 
<b>HSM Integration with Vault Enterprise</b> 
<p>If you are striving for a higher degree of automation, and/or operate in heavily-regulated environments, Vault enterprise and AWS offer the following turnkey solutions: AWS CloudHSM and AWS Key Management Service.</p> 
<p>Both of these services offer a FIPS 140-2 backed hardware to secure your cryptographic keys. For most enterprises, AWS KMS is the service of choice to secure your cryptographic keys. In select cases where an enterprise requires the use of a single-tenant FIPS 142 Level 3 validated HSM, CloudHSM is required.</p> 
<p>CloudHSM is a cloud-based hardware security module that enables you to easily generate and use your own encryption keys on the AWS cloud. With CloudHSM, you can manage your own encryption keys using FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/04/04/HashiCorp-Vault-2.jpg" /></p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 2 – AWS CloudHSM has zero-config high availability that includes automatic backups stored in Amazon S3.</em></p> 
<b>Benefits of Vault and AWS KMS or AWS CloudHSM</b> 
<p><a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/enterprise/auto-unseal/index.html">Automated Unsealing</a>&nbsp;enables operators to delegate the unsealing process to trusted cloud providers. This helps ease operations in the event of partial failure and aids in the creation of new or ephemeral clusters.</p> 
<p>Seal Wrapping wraps values with an additional layer of encryption by immersing Vault’s keyring, internal communications, and cryptographic components used to create keys with cryptography from its auto unseal source. This adds an extra layer of protection and is useful for compliance with regulatory environments, including FIPS 140-2 environments. HashiCorp Vault has been <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/vault-compliance">evaluated as conformant with the FIPS 140-2 standards</a> by Leidos.</p> 
<p>In conclusion, HashiCorp’s Vault is an effective tool for managing your secrets. Through a unified API, AWS integration, and easy implementation, Vault can be integrated into your development at any stage. Vault helps you achieve that extra layer of data security&nbsp;while being able to scale your secret storage, key rolling, and audit logging to enterprise scale.</p>

<p>Cloudten was commissoned to design and build a scalable, secure outbound gateway for icare on AWS. A number of bottlenecks on icare’s on-premises legacy network had resulted in degraded performance and significant delays to major projects. The business requirement was to provide a redundant and cost-effective alternate platform on AWS that enabled icare’s 1,500 staff to access the Internet, email, voice/video conferencing, and a number of mission-critical software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications.</p> 
<p>Cloudten was responsible for the design, delivery, and support of icare’s new environment that utilized a Sophos UTM solution to provide&nbsp;the outbound gateway. By leveraging core AWS services, they were able to deploy the Sophos UTM solution across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).</p> 
<p>This infrastructure was extremely resilient, as all configuration was centrally maintained in&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (Amazon S3). Any single instance failure immediately and automatically resulted in a problem instance being terminated and rebuilt from the master configuration.</p> 
<p>Within a month, Cloudten was able to leverage a number of AWS services–such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/">AWS Direct Connect</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/?nc2=h_m1">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a> (VPC)–as well as the cloud-native Sophos UTM security appliance to deliver not just a working proof of concept, but a staged production cutover.</p> 
<b>The Results</b> 
<p>Cloudten helped alleviate the load on icare’s internal network while allowing the business to meet its project deadlines for Office 365 migration. The noticeable improvement in Internet access speeds has increased staff productivity—approximately 1,500 users leverage this solution on a daily basis and are blissfully unaware that it dynamically scales up and down based on user load.</p> 
<p>This project is a great example of end-to-end build and deployment automation, demonstrating the ability to quickly and effectively deliver positive outcomes in previously impossible time frames.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>“Cloudten provided a highly available, auto scaling Sophos UTM solution deployed in the icare Amazon Web Services environment, which is now used by over 1,500 employees to access cloud services including O365 and others. icare can now rely on fast, stable Internet services that enable our business to provide better services to the people and businesses of NSW.”&nbsp;~ <em>David Johnston, Enterprise Cloud Architect at icare</em></p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Cloudten has a long and successful relationship with icare and has been involved with numerous architectural redesigns of their environment. Cloudten’s in-depth knowledge of icare’s systems, applications, and end-to-end business flows has ensured&nbsp;icare&nbsp;is able to adapt their online and analytics platforms to rapid changes in the IT landscape. All of this while Cloudten expanded their service offerings and increased revenue.</p> 
<p>Cloudten has AWS-certified staff that are specialists in all aspects of cloud architecture and DevOps techniques, with emphasis on security, application integration, and related technologies. Working closely with AWS, Cloudten delivers end-to-end competencies to implement secure, compliant workloads within regulatory frameworks across enterprise and government.</p>

<p style="margin: 0; padding:0;">=======================<p>
<p><em>By Aaron Bawcom, Chief Architect at Candid Partners</em></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/04/05/Migration-3-300x150.jpg" />Migrating a mainframe is a complex project, and we at Candid Partners are focused on solving the toughest business problems using Amazon Web Services (AWS). We have successfully completed a legacy mainframe to AWS migration for a global enterprise client and are actively working on similar initiatives.</p> 
<p>In this post, I will describe the approach, architecture, and lessons learned from this real-life mainframe migration experience.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Candid%20Partners&amp;id=001E000001OLIvhIAH">Candid Partners</a> is an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/">AWS Partner Network</a> (APN) Advanced Consulting Partner with the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/partners/dev-ops/">AWS DevOps Competency</a>. We see many enterprises are still hesitant to undertake large-scale projects involving legacy systems, despite the growth in cloud computing. Mainframes typically run an organization’s most vital systems and likely have run with stability for decades.</p> 
<p>However, these systems now face risk due to attrition of tribal knowledge, missing source code, or general lack of knowledge of how some of the systems are used. Migrating mainframes to AWS provides agility with a pay-as-you-go cost model.</p> 
<b>Program Approach</b> 
<p>Initially, we approached the mainframe migration with a focus on cloud-native solutions and cloud-based capabilities. But we quickly realized that we must become reacquainted with mainframes. In this case, it was a 40-year-old mainframe that had been out of support for over a decade. Some of its data processing components were first built in 1974 and was not recompiled until 2017 in preparation for this AWS migration.</p> 
<p>To prepare, we leaned on our strong program management practice. Any large-scale project will impact critical business processes across the enterprise, and it’s particularly important to not limit the scope to IT operations and application teams. The full project plan included establishing policies and procedures for project oversight and planning, defining leadership roles, developing change management and problem escalation procedures, and determining responsibilities for budgeting and license tracking.</p> 
<b>Scoping and Analysis</b> 
<p>Early on, we encountered some unique challenges that resulted from working with a legacy system. One of the most striking was the attrition of tribal knowledge. Due to the age of the system, many core individuals with institutional knowledge of the mainframe had retired or moved to other positions. This resulted in challenges obtaining usage information such as I/O rates and identifying source code.</p> 
<p>Mainframe environments often contain batch processes and applications that are important but poorly understood, as well as code modules that are rarely or never used. To ensure that nothing important was left out, our migration team needed to discover source code for all mainframe applications in use. This involved:</p> 
<li>Combing through code repositories and other data stores to discover as much source code as possible.</li> 
<li>Documenting all types of processes, including batch processes, transactional processes, and operational processes such as backups.</li> 
<li>Mapping application dependencies.</li> 
<li>Identifying all integration points with external services and applications.</li> 
<li>Extracting usage information related to CPUs, storage, and networks that can be used to estimate requirements for cloud resources.</li> 
<p>Non-functional requirements were also gathered during the analysis phase, including current state baselines. Examples of key non-functional requirements ranged from availability and scalability to compliance with industry standards and user experience. The majority of these requirements can be enhanced through hosting on AWS. Time for testing of these requirements was also built into the project plan prior to implementation to ensure it wouldn’t be delayed until the end of the project.</p> 
<p>The information gathered during the analysis stage is critical for designing the target environment on the cloud platform and planning the migration. In this case, the entire discovery and analysis phase took three months to complete.</p> 
<b>Architecture</b> 
<p>Before any engineering began, the foundational cloud architecture was defined. This architecture matched platform features and available tools against the needs for performance, scalability, high availability, and networking. We also worked with the client to consider issues like process automation, security and compliance, user account management and access control, operations, archiving, and disaster recovery.</p> 
<p>We followed the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/">AWS Well-Architected Framework</a> with infrastructure definitions set up with DevOps automation defining the actual infrastructure as code to allow changes throughout the process. Interestingly, we found there were several integrations that happened directly to the database as opposed to the online or batch interfaces. To control these integrations, we converted mainframe security server access control policies into database schema permissions.</p> 
<p>From a sizing perspective, we found that MIPS, MSU, and ITR were not the greatest indicators of capacity on the mainframe because of simple versus complex instructions, processor optimizations, and because of multiprocessor overhead. Consequently, we identified the System z Processor Capacity Reference to determine <a href="http://www.longpelaexpertise.com/ezine/HowBigMainframe.php">how much usage information was taking place</a>. In terms of complexity, it was a medium-sized mainframe with 28 business applications, 266 integration points, and 1.6 TB of live data.</p> 
<p>For the migration methodology, we chose to use interface and subsystem emulation versus instruction emulation. While it’s possible to do x86 translation of mainframe instruction set at execution time, we realized better performance gains from interface and subsystem emulation for online and batch processing. We used R4 instances to run the application and database server, and we found they were more than capable to process billions of transactions through the system.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/04/08/Candid-Architecture-2-1.jpg" /></p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 1 – AWS architecture for the migrated mainframe workload.</em></p> 
<p>To operationalize the migration, the Candid team defined the foundational cloud infrastructure for the cloud platform on which the current source code would be migrated. The migration team designed the usage of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2), security groups, routing, enterprise AD authorization controls, network access, and designed internal processes for operational support—spanning key functions such as networking, security, logging, and application support.</p> 
<p>A CI/CD pipeline was created to ensure that no infrastructure changes could be made to the solution without proper automated analysis of the infrastructure as code, as well as manual approval gates for changes to the infrastructure environment. We also supported the solution through hypercare and performed knowledge transfer to OS, infrastructure, database, and application support teams.</p> 
<p>Like many IT projects, system dependencies are where all the complexity lives. Since batch processing includes far more dependencies than online processing, we concluded the best practice is to start the conversion of batch-based systems at the same time we start migrating online applications. The ability to show stakeholders real progress on the project by showing the early results of converting online-based applications to the cloud was essential to the success of the project.</p> 
<p>Instead of waiting until all online applications are converted to start the migration of batch applications, we concluded we should start them at the same time. Batch-based applications are dependent on different datasets, different jobs, and integrations with other systems, so starting those conversions early reduces the overall risk of the project.</p> 
<b>Licensing</b> 
<p>Software licensing had a significant impact on the technical architecture. Initially, we assumed that to replicate the performance of a giant metal mainframe we would need to use AWS X1 instances. However, we discovered that costs would add up quickly if software costs are in the range of $10-$100,000 a license per core across the 128 vCPUs of an X1 instance. To minimize this impact, we worked closely with procurement to negotiate favorable licensing terms.</p> 
<p>We found that 30 percent of the operating costs were software licenses supporting the mainframe software tools.</p> 
<b>Change Management</b> 
<p>Mainframes can be used by hundreds or even thousands of people within an enterprise. Many are accustomed to applications that haven’t changed in more than 10 years using green screen terminal interfaces. Due to this, we realized that change management would be integral to gain user acceptance of the migration.</p> 
<p>We identified key influencers in each business unit and recruited them as change agents and brought the users front and center in the process. We furthered change management with an ongoing communications strategy to inform all key stakeholders about the process. Because of this change management strategy, by the end of the project our users were big supporters of the migration.</p> 
<b>Project Plan</b> 
<p>The options for the roll-out strategy was either a “big bang” or staged approach. With the big bang approach, all applications are rolled out at once. This is the approach we selected as it allowed the datacenter to be decommissioned soonest. In the end, the time to the get our first app in the cloud was six months and included four professional service teams made up of two core teams, two supporting teams, and eight software vendors.</p> 
<p>A high-level project plan follows in <em>Figure 2</em>. Within that project plan, approximately six months of preparation, including analysis and setup, was conducted before labor was brought on to start migrations.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/04/06/Candid-Timeline-3.jpg" /></p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 2 – Project timeline with phases for the complete mainframe migration.</em></p> 
<p>To reduce unnecessary work and to minimize risks, our team rationalized the applications that resided on the mainframe. We prioritized the applications using a four-quadrant scale of business value, application complexity, costs, and performance. The sequencing for application migration was then developed based on the prioritization results with highest-value/lowest-complexity applications moving first. Ultimately, two low-business-value applications were not migrated.</p> 
<b>Execution</b> 
<p>A large aspect of a mainframe migration project is testing functional equivalence between the new AWS environment and the legacy mainframe. The migration team performed detailed testing at multiple levels and leveraged automated testing to accelerate the process. The automated testing included components, data assets, data obfuscation, integrations, and application functionality to gain more accurate performance testing of expected and worse-case scenarios. We built minimal scripting around the commercial application tools, but mostly open source tools were used for testing.</p> 
<p>Candid Partners managed the logistics and execution to AWS, transforming applications that processed data in batches based on schedules to a modern architecture. Activities that took place within the plan’s blueprint required the migration team to:</p> 
<li>Recompile x86 processor software, originally based on IBM mainframe technology.</li> 
<li>Modify single-system mainframe applications to expand into a distributed processing topology.</li> 
<li>Recreate batch mode and online transaction processing to offer the green screen experience.</li> 
<li>Convert legacy mainframe databases into a single, modern off-the-shelf relational database.</li> 
<li>Integrate enterprise Active Directory-based authentication versus system-based authentication.</li> 
<li>Include access control capability for user authorization based on Active Directory.</li> 
<p>We made arrangements to train end users, application support personnel, and developers on new application usage patterns, and how to take advantage of the agile capabilities of the cloud platform and tools.</p> 
<p>Moving 40 years of integrations, processing, and interfaces to a modern environment ultimately came down to the management of a big project. The largest success factors for us were close management of dependencies between systems and teams, being able to establish and track timelines, and the ability to meet deliverables.</p> 
<p>As a result of the migration, we have found that new technology exists to provide incredibly intelligent source code analysis, enabling faster and less risky migrations using hybrid migrations.</p> 
<b>Customer Benefits</b> 
<p>Migrating the customer mainframe to AWS with Candid Partners offered many benefits:</p> 
<li>Customer is seeing a reduction in annual cost for the mainframe workload applications of approximately 72 percent including licensed software, application support, and infrastructure costs.</li> 
<li>Performance was significantly better on AWS than previously realized on the mainframe.</li> 
<li>Applications running on a modern, flexible infrastructure, with capacity that can be scaled on demand.</li> 
<li>Opportunities to continually modernize technology, and to improve business agility with agile software development.</li> 
<li>DevOps and Continuous Integration.</li> 
<li>Reduced dependence on disappearing skills and unrecoverable tribal knowledge.</li>

<b class="lb-b blog-post-title" property="name headline">Transforming SAP-Centric Organizations with MiCloud from APN Partner Lemongrass</b> 
<p style="margin: 0; padding:0;">=======================<p>
<p><em>By John Studdert, Partner Solutions Architect at AWS focused on SAP</em></p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Lemongrass%20Consulting&amp;id=001E000000Rp5XcIAJ"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/04/04/Lemongrass_AWS-Solutions-300x150.jpg" /></a>SAP is known for having mission-critical software at the heart of large enterprises worldwide. Many of our customers have been running their key SAP productive systems on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for years.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Lemongrass%20Consulting&amp;id=001E000000Rp5XcIAJ">Lemongrass</a>, an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/">AWS Partner Network</a> (APN) Advanced Consulting Partner with the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/sap/">AWS SAP Competency</a>, has focused exclusively on SAP on AWS since 2010. They consistently produce great outcomes by taking customers through migration and deployment, and then providing a managed service offering using their suite of MiCloud applications.</p> 
<p><a href="http://lemongrassconsulting.com/micloud/">MiCloud</a> is a Lemongrass-owned and developed AWS governance platform that enables:</p> 
<li>Application user self-service through the Start/Stop Cockpit</li> 
<li>Agile operation through automation, task structuring, and knowledge sharing</li> 
<li>Governance through audits, checks, and cost transparency on mobile devices</li> 
<li>Agile projects through global, cross-project RAID management</li> 
<li>Optimizing your bill of material through the trading platform</li> 
<b>Features of MiCloud by Lemongrass</b> 
<p>Some of these applications are designed to help automate and thus alleviate common SAP pain points. Through MiCloud, users of non-production systems are able to self-manage availability, raise issues directly with Lemongrass, and provide feedback and suggestions. They can use the start/stop functionality to automatically stop systems at a scheduled time.</p> 
<p>Customers can use the mobile Cost App to get accurate, up-to-date AWS infrastructure cost information, helping them to fine-tune their AWS usage and reduce costs.</p> 
<p>For a more detailed example, a classic pain point for SAP customers is how long it takes to develop, test, and push changes through the SAP landscape to production while maintaining a reliable system for day-to-day operations. In response to this, the rapid, automated system copy Lemongrass built and added to MiCloud for a major soft drinks company greatly speeds up the operating system- and database-level copy time. You can see Lemongrass discuss this as part of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jM4C-Qr8bU">“This Is My Architecture” video series</a>.</p> 
<p>MiCloud uses <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html">Amazon Machine Image</a> (AMI) creation to conduct system copies. By using the MiCloud Portal, customers can request a system copy to be made by creating a new test system from production, for example. This enables better quality of testing.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/04/04/MiCloud-Lemongrass-1024x482.jpg" /></p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 1 – MiCloud launches an&nbsp;AMI in a temporary Amazon VPC that is separate from the source environment.</em></p> 
<p>Requiring no downtime on the source system, an AMI is created and launched in a temporary <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a> (Amazon VPC) separate from the source environment. This is where further automated tooling built on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/">AWS&nbsp;Systems Manager</a> updates infrastructure characteristics such as host rename. Another AMI is created and launched in the target environment. At this point, customers can carry out the typical SAP post-copy processing steps.</p> 
<p>End-to-end,&nbsp;MiCloud reduces time taken from days to hours, depending on system size. As a result, an overall system refresh based on this approach would be greatly accelerated. This translates into lower downtime for test systems and the option for more frequent system refreshes, which increases the quality of testing.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, this can lead to an ability to push changes through an SAP landscape more rapidly and with less impact on reliability.</p>
