<p><em>By Paul Sears, Partner Solutions Architect at AWS</em></p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Chartio&amp;id=001E000000Rp5PlIAJ"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/19/AWS-Partner-Solutions_Chartio-1-300x150.jpg">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (Amazon S3), consolidating all of their unstructured and structured data into one central, infinitely scalable location. This allows for easy access to that data by users and applications within their organization as part of the data value chain.</p> 
<p>But to make the unstructured and structured data useful or consumable, you previously had to transform the data into a format or schema that your databases and analytics applications could use. Maybe you processed it with <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/emr">Amazon EMR</a> or another Hadoop framework. Or you leveraged <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glue">AWS Glue</a>, our fully-managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service. You could also have used one of our many <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/apn-journal/">AWS Partner solutions</a> to transform important data.</p> 
<p>But what if you need to simplify the data value chain or query your data directly in your data lake? This is where <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/athena">Amazon Athena</a> comes in. Athena is a Presto-distributed SQL engine used to query unstructured data using standard SQL, where you pay only for the amount of data you query.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Chartio&amp;id=001E000000Rp5PlIAJ">Chartio</a>, an AWS Advanced Technology Partner with the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/big-data/">AWS Big Data Competency</a>, recently announced support for Amazon Athena. Their solution allows you to query and visualize data stored in an Amazon S3 data lake using standard SQL. You can also use their visual drag-and-drop SQL layer, which generates native SQL queries for you.<br /> <br /> </p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/19/Chartio-visualization-1024x586.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 1 – Chartio can generate a visualization using Amazon Athena as a data source.</em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Chartio is a powerful-yet-intuitive business intelligence and data exploration solution that allows organizations to quickly and easily query and visualize data from any source. With Chartio’s support for Athena, you no longer have to transform and load your data into <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/">Amazon Redshift</a> or EMR before you create visualizations. Now, you can perform ad hoc queries, join Athena across your disparate cloud apps and databases, and build out customized and interactive dashboards to dig deeper into what’s happening in your business.</p> 
<p>Plus, if there are certain data sets in Athena you know you will query frequently, you can query the data once and utilize <a href="https://support.chartio.com/docs/datastores/">Chartio’s Data Stores</a> to save the results to use without having to send additional queries to Athena. You can then join your Athena data with other sources and apply transformations to the data to get your data exactly how you want it. You can easily control access to Athena but still unleash the data to all of your users with Data Stores, without worrying about extra costs.</p>

<p><em>By Andrew Kloman, Partner Solutions Architect at AWS focused on End User Computing</em><br /> <em><span style="color: #ffffff">By</span> Letian Feng, Senior Product Manager at AWS for Amazon EC2</em></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/14/Developers-300x150.jpg" />Desktop application streaming solutions enable end users to access enterprise applications and data securely. Without these solutions, enterprise applications can still be provided via web interfaces, but they may lack the feature sets, provisioning capabilities, or data protection from the user or end-point device that enterprises require.</p> 
<p>In the past, these technologies were commonly referred to as “remote access solutions,” but as customers move to Amazon Web Services (AWS) all end users are remote to the data and applications hosted on AWS. When desktop application streaming solutions are in place, enterprises&nbsp;can&nbsp;migrate workloads without repurchasing or refactoring the enterprise applications. This means customers can migrate the backend systems of their enterprise applications to AWS and have the desktop applications run next to those backend systems while the desktop application streaming solution provides end users access.</p> 
<p>In 2017, AWS and many of the Technology Partners in our global <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/">AWS Partner Network</a> (APN) invested in efforts to enhance their solutions&nbsp;and help&nbsp;customers migrate enterprise desktop applications to AWS. These Partners are demonstrating the&nbsp;value of supporting AWS services that provide customers with solutions that are secure, easy-to-use, scalable, and cost-effective.</p> 
<b>New AWS&nbsp;Services&nbsp;for&nbsp;Desktop and Application Streaming Partners</b> 
<h3>Performance and Cost</h3> 
<p>T2 instance types are very common given the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/low-cost-burstable-ec2-instances/">T2 instance</a> concept of CPU credits providing ample performance at a compelling price point. In November 2017, we extended this model to support <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-t2-unlimited-going-beyond-the-burst-with-high-performance/">T2 Unlimited</a>, providing the ability to sustain high CPU performance over any desired time frame while keeping costs low.</p> 
<h3>Graphics</h3> 
<p>Many simple desktop workloads, such as Word editing and web browsing, can be migrated to servers without the need to provision GPUs. However, there are some workloads where GPUs are beneficial or crucial to the user experience. Customers typically need GPUs in streaming solutions for two reasons:</p> 
<li><strong>Improve user experience for generic use cases through CPU-offloading.</strong> Many workloads do not require GPU to run but benefit from the presence of GPU for better performance. These include video viewing, video conferencing, PowerPoint, streaming encoding, and lightweight 3D processing. By using the video encoder and Direct3D API support of GPUs, customers can get a smoother experience or provision less CPU for the same workload.</li> 
<li><strong>Host 3D-intensive applications.</strong> Virtually all professional graphics applications rely on GPU graphics APIs, such as OpenGL and Direct3D, to function correctly and smoothly. Without GPUs, applications can refuse to start or switch to software emulation mode, which reduces performance and user experience. Some applications may also require GPU compute APIs, such as CUDA or OpenCL.</li> 
<h3>Amazon EC2 Elastic GPUs for Windows</h3> 
<p>In August 2017, we announced the general availability of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ec2-elastic-gpus-for-windows/">Amazon EC2 Elastic GPUs</a> for Windows. This is a resource you can attach to your <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) instance to accelerate the graphics performance of your applications. Elastic GPUs are best suited for applications that require a small or intermittent amount of additional GPU power for graphics acceleration and support OpenGL. Elastic GPUs support up to and including the OpenGL 4.3 API standards with expanded API support coming soon.</p> 
<h3>G3 Instance Type</h3> 
<p>In July 2017, we launched the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-next-generation-gpu-powered-ec2-instances-g3/">G3 instance type</a>, powered by NVIDIA Tesla M60 GPUs. The GPUs support <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL 4.5</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX">DirectX 12.0</a>, <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html">CUDA 8.0</a>, and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL 1.2</a>. When you launch a G3 instance, you have access to one NVIDIA GRID Virtual Workstation License per GPU and can make use of the NVIDIA GRID driver without purchasing a license on your own. For GRID virtual application licenses, up to 25 simultaneous sessions can be under a single license. This makes the G3 instance type perfect for VDI use cases, as well as multiple sessions per instance solutions like Microsoft Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH).</p> 
<p>To <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/activate_grid.html">activate the GRID capabilities</a> on G3 instances, such as NVIDIA GRID Virtual Workstation or NVIDIA GRID Virtual Applications, you must define the product type for the driver&nbsp;in the registry and disable the licensing page in the control panel to prevent users from accidentally changing the product type.</p> 
<b>AWS Partners Invested in Desktop Application Streaming Solutions</b> 
<p>In 2017, AWS Partners invested in efforts to enhance their streaming solutions running on AWS with the goal of satisfying enterprise customers’ needs of migrating desktop applications to AWS. Here are some highlights from AWS Partners&nbsp;that&nbsp;built and optimized&nbsp;products in this space to run on AWS, and provided technical content, labs, and workshops to guide customer adoption of desktop application streaming solutions.</p> 
<p>These offerings can run on top of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) and support other AWS features and services, manage the lifecycle of desktop workloads on AWS, or provide a managed control plane, and/or desktop resource.</p> 
<h3>Fully Managed Solutions Running on AWS</h3> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/06/Frame-Logo-150x150.jpg" />These are turnkey solutions where the mechanism that provisions and manages the lifecycle of desktop resources on AWS, and to the end user, is a managed offering. These solutions address identity, tenant isolation, and data partitioning, and&nbsp;have developed their own intellectual property to automate the offering into Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS).</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Frame&amp;id=001E000000r2gixIAA">Frame</a> is an AWS Standard Technology and Public Sector Partner that provides customers with the ability to spin up secure cloud workspaces in any AWS region. In August 2017, Frame announced <a href="https://blog.fra.me/aws-elastic-gpus-now-on-frame-81935be33903">support for Elastic GPUs and G3 Instance types</a>, and has been testing Elastic GPUs where they have seen solid results with apps such as Google Earth, ANSYS AIM, Siemens SolidEdge, Adobe Photoshop, and more.</p> 
<p>At AWS re:Invent 2017, Frame CEO Nikola Bozinovic presented a session on Elastic GPUs along with AWS Senior Product Manager Letian Feng. The session was titled “Unleash Your Graphics Solutions with the Flexibility of Elastic,” and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd66KQe1ujU&amp;feature=youtu.be#t=12m23s">watch it on the AWS YouTube page</a>.</p> 
<h3>Solutions Running on Amazon EC2 with Managed Resources on AWS</h3> 
<p>These are designed for customers that want to deploy and manage a solution in their own AWS account and scale desktops seamlessly. Additionally, these solutions are designed to work with AWS and provide lifecycle management and governance tools for the desktop resources deployed on AWS.</p>

<h3>Solutions That Complement Desktop Application Streaming Solutions</h3> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/06/Liquidware-Logo-150x150.jpg" />Depending on the complexity and scalability of an environment, a layering approach may help ease management of the resource plane by adding layers of virtualization between the operating system (OS), application, and user profile. Without layering, all user profile, application, and OS data is managed within the OS image. In this model, any modifications to the OS image, including patching, must be performed on each image. This can be very complex and time consuming at scale.</p> 
<p>These solutions help reduce configuration bloat by managing end user profiles. Depending on the use case, profiles can be non-persistent or persistent, saving user settings configured by the user and providing a unique OS and application experience.</p>

<p>To gain the insights needed to fuel business growth, organizations need to collect more data and do more with it. That’s where a data lake can help—it’s a repository that holds a large amount of raw data in its native (structured or unstructured) format until that data is needed, enabling you to accommodate virtually any use case.</p> 
<p><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/data-lake-foundation-with-zeppelin-and-rds/">Check out&nbsp;Cloudwick’s Data Lake Foundation on AWS Quick Start &gt;&gt;</a></strong></p> 
<p>Data lakes can be applied to any industry vertical&nbsp;and&nbsp;usually employ an ELT (extract, load, and transform if necessary) strategy, as compared to the more common ETL (extract, transform, and load) strategy employed in a traditional data warehouse, where the structure must be defined before data is loaded. With a data lake, you don’t need to think through every possible use case ahead of time. You should include a data catalog, though, which I will get into a bit later.</p> 
<p>So how can you build your own data lake and put it to use? A while back,&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=CLOUDWICK%20TECHNOLOGIES&amp;id=001E000000UfaSDIAZ">Cloudwick</a>—an AWS Advanced Consulting Partner that holds the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/partner-solutions/">AWS Big Data Competency</a>—began offering a&nbsp;<a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/rs/112-TZM-766/images/AWS_SolutionLaunchpad_DataLake_Cloudwick_08032017.pdf">Data Lake Jumpstart</a>&nbsp;to help customers deploy, pilot, and migrate into production a fully-functional data lake running on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This four-week engagement is a heavily-discounted program from both AWS and Cloudwick, with a typical cost of less than $20,000.</p> 
<p>If you’d like to experiment with a data lake but aren’t ready for that kind of investment, check out our&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/data-lake-foundation-with-zeppelin-and-rds/">Data Lake Foundation on AWS Quick Start</a>&nbsp;that we co-authored along with AWS Solutions Architects.&nbsp;You can use this Quick Start to get your own data lake up and running in about 20 minutes. There are no consulting fees, and you won’t pay anything beyond the costs to run it on AWS.</p> 
<p>In this blog post, I will provide a high-level overview of our Quick Start—and then drill down a bit deeper into the workings and value of the data catalog, which we implemented using Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES).</p> 
<b>Architecture for the Data Lake Foundation on AWS Quick Start</b> 
<p>At a high level, our Quick Start provides a data lake foundation that integrates various&nbsp;AWS services to help you migrate both structured and unstructured data from your on-premises environment to the AWS Cloud—and then store, monitor, and analyze the data. <em>Figure 1</em> provides a top-down architectural view, and a full description—including solution architecture, deployment options, and detailed deployment steps—can be found in the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-reference/datalake/cloudwick/latest/doc/data-lake-foundation-wth-zeppelin-and-amazon-rds-on-the-aws-cloud.pdf">deployment guide</a>.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/06/Cloudwick-Data-Lake-Architecture-1024x587.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 1 – This Quick Start provides a data lake foundation that integrates various AWS services to help you migrate both structured and unstructured data from your on-premises environment to the AWS Cloud.</em></p> 
<p>After you deploy the data lake, you can use it to collect and combine multiple data sources and data types in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (Amazon S3) with a unified view across all the data. This enables a path to ground truth—that is, information provided by direct observation and empirical evidence vs. information provided by inference—and provides a common repository for that information to be shared.</p> 
<h3>Here’s How it All Comes Together:</h3> 
<li>When you launch the Quick Start, it sets up a virtual private cloud (VPC) that spans two Availability Zones and includes two public and private subnets, along with an internet gateway. You can chose to create a new VPC or deploy into your existing VPC on AWS. If you choose the latter, the AWS CloudFormation template that deploys the Quick Start skips creating the VPC and internet gateway.</li> 
<li>In the public subnets, managed NAT gateways allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets, and optional Linux bastion hosts in an Auto Scaling group allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in the public and private subnets. This allows secure access to all the data lake components. Such a setup not only prevents unauthorized access to the data lake but enables integration with other components through NAT gateway.</li> 
<li>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), which is also deployed in the private subnets, enables data migration from a relational database to Amazon Redshift using AWS Data Pipeline. For ETL, we can also leverage AWS Glue.</li> 
<li>In the private subnets, a web server instance (Amazon Machine Image, or AMI) in an Auto Scaling group hosts the data lake portal. This web server also installs Zeppelin to run analytics on the data loaded into Amazon S3.</li> 
<li>AWS Lambda&nbsp;is used to index the metadata from different data sources into Amazon ES. This enables indexing the data flowing into the data lake at scale, without human intervention, and provides visibility into the data. We also use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-zeppelin.html">Zeppelin for ad hoc and exploratory data analysis</a>.</li> 
<li>IAM roles are used to manage permissions to access AWS resources—such as accessing the data in Amazon S3, enabling Amazon Redshift to copy data from Amazon S3 into its tables, and associating the generated IAM role with the Amazon Redshift cluster.</li> 
<li>The other key services being used are Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB). Both&nbsp;of these services are important pillars of a well-architected application in cloud. Auto Scaling, for example, allows&nbsp;Amazon EC2 capacity to scale out or scale in as per demand, while ELB allows the traffic to be spread across the Amazon EC2 fleet. ELBs support multiple types—Application, Network and Classic Load Balancing—and depending on the application use case, customers can pick up the Load Balancers.</li> 
<b>The Value of a Data Catalog and Why We Used Amazon ES</b> 
<p>Let’s talk about the data catalog, which is supported through our use of Amazon ES. The variety, velocity, and veracity of data that flows into your data lake can be vast, which is why a strong data management layer is required. The data catalog is at the core of this layer and, as such, is the number one component to consider when architecting a data lake.</p> 
<p>But why is the data catalog so important? Remember, the beauty of a data lake is that you don’t need to think through every possible use case up front. To use the data you collect effectively, however, you’ll need to capture metadata to identify which data streams are coming into your data lake, where they come from, their format, and other aspects. Amazon ES does just that, automatically indexing the data that flows into your data lake and making it available via a simple search.</p> 
<p>The diagram in <em>Figure 2</em> shows how this indexing is performed:</p> 
<li>Files can flow into Amazon S3 through any channel.</li> 
<li>File creation in Amazon S3 produces an event you can catch with a Lambda function.</li> 
<li>The Lambda function retrieves data and metadata from Amazon S3, and pushes it into Amazon ES.</li> 
<li>Using Direct&nbsp;Amazon ES&nbsp;API calls or, at a larger scale, Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose can be used to populate Amazon ES. You can also use Logstash, which is a data-collection and log-parsing engine.</li> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/05/Indexing-a-Data-Catalog.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 2 – Having access to so many options for populating the data catalog and indexing the data makes this Quick Start architecture a versatile means of collecting different types of information.</em></p> 
<p>Because the data catalog is indexed, searches are very fast.&nbsp;More importantly, the data catalog makes information in the data lake&nbsp;easy to discover and is accessible by many users, not just the people who built it. The data catalog also gives your data scientists, business analysts, and other users unencumbered, self-service access to the information without the need for highly specialized technical assistance. And because Amazon ES includes Kibana, those users can visualize the content that’s indexed on an&nbsp;Elasticsearch cluster in powerful ways. In addition, Amazon ES captures and indexes all API calls to the data lake, giving you a full audit record of who accessed what.</p> 
<p>At this point, you may be asking, “I get the value of Elasticsearch, but what’s the difference between Elasticsearch—an open source offering—and Amazon ES?” Put simply, Amazon ES makes it easy to deploy, secure, operate, and scale Elasticsearch for log analytics, full text search, application monitoring, and more. As a fully managed service, Amazon ES provides all the capabilities of Elasticsearch alongside the availability, scalability, and security that production workloads require. It even includes built-in integrations with Kibana, Logstash, and AWS services such as Amazon VPC, Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, AWS Lambda, and Amazon CloudWatch—enabling you to go from raw data to actionable insights very quickly.</p> 
<b>Conclusion</b> 
<p>Do you absolutely need a built-in data catalog like the one we implemented using Amazon ES? In my opinion, yes. I often come across companies with data lakes that lack such capabilities, and they suffer from a damaging lack of visibility into data sources, data formats, frequency of data capture, and other aspects of their data. They&nbsp;often have this information somewhere, but it is stored in a place where it&nbsp;is not&nbsp;useful or accessible. A data catalog based on Amazon ES automatically captures and surfaces what’s in your data lake, making it infinitely more valuable when it comes to why you built it in the first place: to uncover the insights needed to fuel business growth.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.splunk.com/blog/2017/12/13/introducing-splunk-aws-serverless-apps.html">Splunk AWS Serverless Applications</a> are available from the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> console and allow customers to ingest TBs of data into Splunk. As a Lambda blueprint launch partner in 2015, Splunk released two blueprints. As serverless adoption grew, they added more purpose-built blueprints based on customer requests for different data sources.</p>

<b>Splunk Lambda Blueprints for You to Use</b> 
<p>In collaboration with AWS, Splunk ported six of its existing Splunk Lambda blueprints into Splunk Serverless Apps. These blueprints are available directly in the Serverless Application Repository:</p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>splunk-logging</strong>: Log events from AWS Lambda itself to Splunk’s HTTP event collector</li> 
<li><strong>splunk-dynamodb-stream-processor</strong>: Stream <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/?nc2=h_m1">Amazon DynamoDB</a> events to Splunk’s HTTP event collector</li> 
<li><strong>splunk-elb-application-access-logs-processor</strong>: Stream Application&nbsp;Load Balancer&nbsp;access logs from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc2=h_m1">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (Amazon S3) to Splunk’s HTTP event collector</li> 
<li><strong>splunk-elb-classic-access-logs-processor</strong>: Stream Classic&nbsp;Load Balancer&nbsp;access logs from&nbsp;Amazon S3 to Splunk’s HTTP event collector</li> 
<li><strong>splunk-iot-processor</strong>: Stream AWS IoT Core events to Splunk’s HTTP event collector</li> 
<li><strong>splunk-kinesis-stream-processor</strong>: Stream events from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/">Amazon Kinesis Video Stream</a> to Splunk’s HTTP event collector</li> 
</ol>
