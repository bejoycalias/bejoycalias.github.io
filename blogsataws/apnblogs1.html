<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B071NV8MXT?qid=1519850702868&amp;sr=0-1&amp;ref_=srh_res_product_title"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/26/BlockApps_AWS-Solutions-300x150.jpg" /></a>Blockchain is a foundational technology that is as promising as it is exciting to explore. What is blockchain? It’s the application of a technology in which a list of records, or blocks, are cryptographically linked to one another via timestamps and other attributes. Blockchains are resistant to data modification since the alteration of one block requires consensus across the recorded chain or ledger.</p> 
<p>With blockchain, it truly becomes a journey of identifying new business models, or optimizing existing ones, to drive the right technology selection for the underlying protocol. As with many journeys, you will need a solid plan, the right tools, and a trusted advisor.</p> 
<p>As you evaluate blockchain protocols, it’s important to understand the underlying pillars of these architectures. Concepts like immutability, distributed ledgers, smart contracts, and the shared perception of truth or consensus are virtually universal. This makes Ethereum a popular starting point for anyone looking to build decentralized applications, or DApps. But setting up an Ethereum network (IDEs, compilers, wallets, APIs, etc.) can be time consuming and,&nbsp;ultimately, may not validate your use case in a timely manner.</p> 
<p>So, what if you want to write your first DApp in a matter of minutes?</p> 
<p><a href="https://blockapps.net/">BlockApps</a> is a leading provider of Ethereum blockchain development solutions. Their private implementation, written in Haskell, provides a highly scalable Ethereum-compliant blockchain with an industry standard RESTful API and an easy-to-use web-based management dashboard.</p> 
<p>These features and quick deployments through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B071NV8MXT?qid=1519850702868&amp;sr=0-1&amp;ref_=srh_res_product_title">AWS Marketplace</a> enable developers to build, test, and deploy smart contracts faster than ever.</p> 
<b>Key Components of the BlockApps Platform:</b> 
<li><strong>STRATO Management Dashboard (SMD):</strong> Web-based UI for your Private Ethereum Blockchain Network. SMD allows you to interact with user accounts, manage smart contracts in a single dashboard, and explore blocks and transactions. CMD leverages Bloc and STRATO APIs for user and contracts management while offering a SQL-like query interface for smart-contracts leveraging Cirrus.</li> 
<li><strong>Bloc API:</strong> A comprehensive API allowing for user, account management, and smart-contracts management.</li> 
<li><strong>STRATO API:</strong> Blockchain API for exploring and managing blocks and transactions.</li> 
<li><strong>Cirrus:</strong> SQL-like query API for looking up smart-contracts and state changes. Cirrus allows you to index and search smart-contracts by leveraging familiar techniques.</li> 
<p>If you would like to try this solution out,&nbsp;check out&nbsp;BlockApps’&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B071NV8MXT">STRATO Ethereum Blockchain Platform – Developer Edition</a>&nbsp;on AWS Marketplace.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/26/BlockApps-dashboard-1.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 1 – STRATO Management Dashboard (SMD) shows the current state of the network. Users can inspect blocks and view accounts, launched contracts, and transaction processing metrics.</em></p> 
<b>Building Your First Decentralized Application Stack</b> 
<p>Now that we have a base STRATO stack set up, let’s focus on what it means to derive value from a blockchain application. This is where BlockApps’ core tenants driving the direction of STRATO’s platform vision help us out. BlockApps STRATO is a blockchain platform aimed at practical business and consumer usage. They achieve this by focusing on acceleration, ease of use, and performance scale and security.</p> 
<p>In practice, this means&nbsp;you can use existing technologies where applicable instead of re-inventing the wheel. You will notice that even though BlockApps leverages the Ethereum protocol and reuses the Solidity compiler (Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM) without change. They integrate industry-standard relational databases for search and reporting workloads adjacent to the blockchain and utilize RESTful APIs for integration with client applications.</p> 
<p>This can be demonstrated through a <a href="https://github.com/blockapps/blockapps-ba">Supply Chain Demo App</a> built on top of STRATO platform, along with user and development guides.&nbsp;These resources enable you&nbsp;to examine a sample DApp architecture that combines best practices of control plane separation found in traditional Software Development Methodologies, underpinned by Ethereum and smart contracts.</p> 
<p>The diagram in <em>Figure 2</em> shows a typical decentralized application stack built on top of BlockApps. This is a good visualization of how blockchain-specific components, such as the protocol (i.e. Enterprise Ethereum) and business logic (i.e. smart contracts) can be used to build a full application stack completed by the API layers, application middleware, and user interface.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/26/BlockApps-application-stack-1.jpg" />

<b>Next Steps</b> 
<p>Blockchain-based applications introduce new possibilities for both peer-to-peer and enterprise optimization solutions.&nbsp;Amazon Web Services (AWS) is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/blockchain/">investing in blockchain through our partner community</a>.

<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/17/Build_border.png">Part 1 of the series</a> for an overview of the process, a description of the initial review, and a list of the critical findings identified by the review team.</p> 
<p>In <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/testing-aws-gameday-with-the-aws-well-architected-framework-remediation/">Part 2 of the series</a>, we remediated the critical findings found in our initial review. We still have other recommendations that we identified to address in our roadmap, and it’s been six months since we remediated our findings. A lot has happened since then, with all the new services and features that were announced at <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/">AWS re:Invent 2017</a>.</p> 
<p>In this post, we’ll cover how we plan on remediating the deficiencies found in our Disaster Recovery plan, as well as other optimizations we’ve made due to recent announcements. We will also discuss how to address another crucial component in our application development—testing.</p> 
<b>Disaster Recovery Deficiencies</b> 
<p>In part 2, you’ll recall we ran a “war game” for our Disaster Recovery plan which focused on the scenario of losing control of a production account. In these tests, we discovered that our move to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation</a> to deploy resources gave us the ability to quickly provision identical infrastructure in other accounts and regions. However, we still had work to do to refine our playbooks and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on the exact steps. The most important piece that required attention was our strategy for data stored in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a>. We didn’t have automatic backups, and the few manual backups we did have&nbsp;weren’t actively copying to other AWS accounts due to the complexity involved.</p> 
<p>Our initial plan to backup DynamoDB was to leverage <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/?nc2=h_m1">AWS Data Pipeline</a>, which has a built-in template which takes snapshots of your database and stores it in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc2=h_m1">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (Amazon S3). This allows us to back up our tables, but it had some downsides, too. Behind the scenes, Data Pipeline is running an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/emr">Amazon EMR</a> cluster that retrieves all the items from our table and writes them to Amazon S3. For this reason, it isn’t as quick as we’d like, and due to the abstraction layer it’s hard to debug if anything were to go wrong.</p> 
<p>Additionally, this has a performance impact on our tables since it’s doing a scan operation and is taxing on read capacity. Also, since this is for our Disaster Recovery scenario, our desired end state is for our backups to end up in a different account—the one we will be failing over to in the event of a disaster. This task can be done with Data Pipeline but requires a lot of additional configuration and adds more complexity.</p> 
<p>We then considered using DynamoDB streams to write to a DynamoDB table in our other account, but this doesn’t protect us from propagating errors, and it doesn’t provide us with point-in-time recovery. We had been brainstorming a solution to this problem for some time, when, at AWS re:Invent 2017, we announced the ability to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/backup-restore/">take backups of DynamoDB tables</a> via the click of a button or simple API call. This feature allows us to take encrypted backups of DynamoDB tables without a performance impact, and it doesn’t require us to provision any additional infrastructure. However, as of this post, the missing piece is that these backups are only available within the same AWS account and region, and they cannot be copied to another account or region.</p> 
<p>The DynamoDB team also came out with the concept of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/global-tables/">Global Tables</a>, a multi-master DynamoDB table that spans AWS regions. This currently doesn’t support replication across accounts; only across regions within the same account. Now this by itself wouldn’t meet our Disaster Recovery requirements, as replication is not a substitute for backup (e.g. data corruption would be replicated). But if we combined this approach with the previous Backup/Restore feature, this solves our Disaster Recovery strategy. Due to AWS continuing to release new features and enhancements, we communicated the need for these enhancements to our account team and will continue to check to see if they are implemented.</p> 
<p>In the meantime, we needed to come up with a viable solution. We stumbled upon a <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/dynamodb-continuous-backup">continuous DynamoDB backup solution</a> that’s published on the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs">AWS Labs GitHub repo</a>. This solution restores individual items and&nbsp;offers point-in-time recovery. We are in the process of evaluating this solution, which provides us with better granularity of our backups, but it still requires some modification to fulfill our cross-account requirement.</p> 
<p>Based on the lessons learned from our “war game” and continued refinement of our SOPs and playbooks, we have implemented quarterly testing to ensure we are prepared and have the necessary tooling in place.</p> 
<b>Amazon EC2 – M5 Instances</b> 
<p>When we moved to an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ecs">Amazon Elastic Container Service</a> (Amazon ECS) cluster, we selected the M4 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) instance family for our nodes. We chose this family after careful consideration, benchmarking, and cost comparison to other EC2 instance types. In particular, this instance family was a good fit because the Docker containers running on the clusters were neither CPU-bound, IO-bound, nor Memory-bound, but rather a balance of all.</p> 
<p>After AWS re:Invent 2017, we were excited to hear about the introduction of M5, the next-generation <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/m5-the-next-generation-of-general-purpose-ec2-instances/">general purpose instance family</a>. In Jeff Barr’s blog post, he announced the M5 could achieve a better price-performance ratio than the M4 family, by as much as 14 percent. Needless to say, we quickly dove into the console and began testing the M5 instance family in our development environment. We determined M5 provided approximately a 10 percent performance improvement over our current configuration while keeping costs the same.</p> 
<p>At the end of the day, migrating from the M4 to M5 instance family meant we could run less EC2 instances in our Amazon ECS cluster to achieve equivalent performance, and therefore lower operating costs. Keep in mind there was no guarantee the M5 family would enable us to run our workload more cost effectively, as every workload is different. Benchmarking and extensive testing allowed us to safely and methodically calculate the benefits and make the final decision to migrate.</p> 
<b>AWS Fargate</b> 
<p>Another exciting announcement from AWS re:Invent 2017 was the launch of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">AWS Fargate</a>, a managed and easy-to-use service for deploying and managing containers. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/introducing-aws-fargate-a-technology-to-run-containers-without-managing-infrastructure/">This announcement</a> was particularly exciting because we were in charge of deploying and managing our own Amazon ECS cluster to run and scale our GameDay workload.</p> 
<p>The deployment of the GameDay workload Amazon ECS cluster is currently automated using CloudFormation and Amazon EC2 Scaling Groups. While this approach drastically reduced our day-to-day burden of operating the cluster, we still saw an opportunity for further improvement, simplification, and cost savings by considering AWS Fargate. Naturally, we investigated and dug in further.</p> 
<p>The first thing we considered is how AWS Fargate could eliminate the burden of operating an Amazon ECS cluster. As a managed service, we don’t have to create the cluster, but we instruct AWS Fargate how to deploy our container and how many we need. This means less opportunity for operator error on our end, and easier management of our infrastructure during production events. This also translates to cost savings since it means we need less high-skilled engineers at the helm when running GameDay events.</p> 
<p>In addition to operational simplicity, there is an opportunity for additional cost savings as AWS Fargate’s billing model means we pay only for the running containers. This means that for smaller events we pay only for the containers that are running rather than paying for a full-sized Amazon ECS cluster that costs the same whether we are running a small game or a large game. It’s also worth noting that AWS Fargate allows for seamless scaling, meaning we can scale for larger events very easily without have to scale our Amazon ECS clusters manually, which can be error prone.</p> 
<p>As of this post, we are planning our strategy for testing and ultimately migrating toward AWS Fargate rather than deploying and managing our current Amazon ECS cluster.</p> 
<b>Testing</b> 
<p>Based on the changes we have implemented thus far, there have been some significant architectural modifications. Our team had an event coming up and we knew it would be wise to run several tests to ensure—from an infrastructure and application perspective—everything was working and that we hadn’t introduced any new issues. We found minor items in our testing that we were able to remediate, and we felt confident everything would perform as expected. When it came time to run the actual event, we encountered errors that we previously hadn’t found in our testing.</p> 
<p>When we did our testing, we ran them in large numbers to stress the application and discover as many edge cases as possible. But we didn’t reach the same level of scale we would in our actual event. We were experiencing a hot key issue with DynamoDB, which isn’t something that can be easily remedied during the event since it involves changing our schema. We have since remedied this, and our next iteration of testing will mirror not only our estimated numbers but additional load to ensure we have room for unexpected growth.</p> 
<b>It Was Worth It</b> 
<p>Our team was initially apprehensive about performing a Well-Architected review, as we knew areas of our application weren’t pretty and we didn’t want to draw attention to them. We knew these areas needed work, but we were struggling to prioritize fixing them. We focused on new features as opposed to fixing our existing technical debt. However, looking back on it, we now have a much stronger architecture and can honestly say we feel more prepared for various scenarios in the future. We will continue to work with our account team to ensure we are continuing to follow best practices. We will also keep an eye towards new features and enhancements that can solve some of our existing challenges.</p> 
<b>What’s Next</b> 
<p>GameDay as a training and enablement tool has taken off internally due to the feedback we have received from customers. While&nbsp;our team was continuing to iterate on the version of GameDay outlined in this post, we have been working on building a multi-tenant SaaS platform to enable other teams within AWS to run GameDay and make it more self-service. This new platform powered GameDay at AWS re:Invent 2017 and will power new versions of GameDay moving forward.</p> 
<p>We hope to see you at the next event!</p>

This is even more pronounced for corporations that have little knowledge of firmware development for embedded devices, as is the case when established corporations adopt IoT for new product releases.</p> 
<p>Traditionally, when working with embedded devices, a developer needs a complex set of tools on their machine, ranging from embedded toolchains (open source are hard to configure, and commercial are very expensive) to Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and specialty tools to interface with the target embedded hardware device. This has been a long-standing issue with embedded development.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.zerynth.com/">Zerynth</a>, an AWS Standard Technology Partner, provides a software development suite that enables Python programming on 32-bit microcontrollers and allows easy connectivity to&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot/">AWS IoT</a> services. As of this post, Zerynth supports more than 30 different hardware boards, making it a complete ecosystem for IoT development.</p> 
<p>By providing a completely integrated development environment with support for Python, Zerynth removes most the complexities of embedded development, thus making it easier and quicker to launch an IoT product to the market.</p>

This allows for easy access to that data by users and applications within their organization as part of the data value chain.</p> 
<p>But to make the unstructured and structured data useful or consumable, you previously had to transform the data into a format or schema that your databases and analytics applications could use. Maybe you processed it with <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/emr">Amazon EMR</a> or another Hadoop framework. Or you leveraged <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glue">AWS Glue</a>, our fully-managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service. You could also have used one of our many <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/apn-journal/">AWS Partner solutions</a> to transform important data.</p> 
<p>But what if you need to simplify the data value chain or query your data directly in your data lake? This is where <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/athena">Amazon Athena</a> comes in. Athena is a Presto-distributed SQL engine used to query unstructured data using standard SQL, where you pay only for the amount of data you query.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Chartio&amp;id=001E000000Rp5PlIAJ">Chartio</a>, an AWS Advanced Technology Partner with the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/big-data/">AWS Big Data Competency</a>, recently announced support for Amazon Athena. Their solution allows you to query and visualize data stored in an Amazon S3 data lake using standard SQL. You can also use their visual drag-and-drop SQL layer, which generates native SQL queries for you.<br /> <br /> </p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/19/Chartio-visualization-1024x586.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 1 – Chartio can generate a visualization using Amazon Athena as a data source.</em></p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Chartio is a powerful-yet-intuitive business intelligence and data exploration solution that allows organizations to quickly and easily query and visualize data from any source. With Chartio’s support for Athena, you no longer have to transform and load your data into <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/">Amazon Redshift</a> or EMR before you create visualizations. Now, you can perform ad hoc queries, join Athena across your disparate cloud apps and databases, and build out customized and interactive dashboards to dig deeper into what’s happening in your business.</p> 
<p>Plus, if there are certain data sets in Athena you know you will query frequently, you can query the data once and utilize <a href="https://support.chartio.com/docs/datastores/">Chartio’s Data Stores</a> to save the results to use without having to send additional queries to Athena. You can then join your Athena data with other sources and apply transformations to the data to get your data exactly how you want it.

<p><em>By Andrew Kloman, Partner Solutions Architect at AWS focused on End User Computing</em><br /> <em><span style="color: #ffffff">By</span> Letian Feng, Senior Product Manager at AWS for Amazon EC2</em></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/14/Developers-300x150.jpg" />Desktop application streaming solutions enable end users to access enterprise applications and data securely. Without these solutions, enterprise applications can still be provided via web interfaces, but they may lack the feature sets, provisioning capabilities, or data protection from the user or end-point device that enterprises require.</p> 
<p>In the past, these technologies were commonly referred to as “remote access solutions,” but as customers move to Amazon Web Services (AWS) all end users are remote to the data and applications hosted on AWS. When desktop application streaming solutions are in place, enterprises&nbsp;can&nbsp;migrate workloads without repurchasing or refactoring the enterprise applications. This means customers can migrate the backend systems of their enterprise applications to AWS and have the desktop applications run next to those backend systems while the desktop application streaming solution provides end users access.</p> 
<p>In 2017, AWS and many of the Technology Partners in our global <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/">AWS Partner Network</a> (APN) invested in efforts to enhance their solutions&nbsp;and help&nbsp;customers migrate enterprise desktop applications to AWS. These Partners are demonstrating the&nbsp;value of supporting AWS services that provide customers with solutions that are secure, easy-to-use, scalable, and cost-effective.</p> 
<b>New AWS&nbsp;Services&nbsp;for&nbsp;Desktop and Application Streaming Partners</b> 
<h3>Performance and Cost</h3> 
<p>T2 instance types are very common given the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/low-cost-burstable-ec2-instances/">T2 instance</a> concept of CPU credits providing ample performance at a compelling price point. In November 2017, we extended this model to support <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-t2-unlimited-going-beyond-the-burst-with-high-performance/">T2 Unlimited</a>, providing the ability to sustain high CPU performance over any desired time frame while keeping costs low.</p> 
<h3>Graphics</h3> 
<p>Many simple desktop workloads, such as Word editing and web browsing, can be migrated to servers without the need to provision GPUs. However, there are some workloads where GPUs are beneficial or crucial to the user experience. Customers typically need GPUs in streaming solutions for two reasons:</p> 
<li><strong>Improve user experience for generic use cases through CPU-offloading.</strong> Many workloads do not require GPU to run but benefit from the presence of GPU for better performance. These include video viewing, video conferencing, PowerPoint, streaming encoding, and lightweight 3D processing. By using the video encoder and Direct3D API support of GPUs, customers can get a smoother experience or provision less CPU for the same workload.</li> 
<li><strong>Host 3D-intensive applications.</strong> Virtually all professional graphics applications rely on GPU graphics APIs, such as OpenGL and Direct3D, to function correctly and smoothly. Without GPUs, applications can refuse to start or switch to software emulation mode, which reduces performance and user experience. Some applications may also require GPU compute APIs, such as CUDA or OpenCL.</li> 
<h3>Amazon EC2 Elastic GPUs for Windows</h3> 
<p>In August 2017, we announced the general availability of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ec2-elastic-gpus-for-windows/">Amazon EC2 Elastic GPUs</a> for Windows. This is a resource you can attach to your <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) instance to accelerate the graphics performance of your applications. Elastic GPUs are best suited for applications that require a small or intermittent amount of additional GPU power for graphics acceleration and support OpenGL. Elastic GPUs support up to and including the OpenGL 4.3 API standards with expanded API support coming soon.</p> 
<h3>G3 Instance Type</h3> 
<p>In July 2017, we launched the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-next-generation-gpu-powered-ec2-instances-g3/">G3 instance type</a>, powered by NVIDIA Tesla M60 GPUs. The GPUs support <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL 4.5</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX">DirectX 12.0</a>, <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html">CUDA 8.0</a>, and <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL 1.2</a>. When you launch a G3 instance, you have access to one NVIDIA GRID Virtual Workstation License per GPU and can make use of the NVIDIA GRID driver without purchasing a license on your own. For GRID virtual application licenses, up to 25 simultaneous sessions can be under a single license. This makes the G3 instance type perfect for VDI use cases, as well as multiple sessions per instance solutions like Microsoft Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH).</p> 
<p>To <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/activate_grid.html">activate the GRID capabilities</a> on G3 instances, such as NVIDIA GRID Virtual Workstation or NVIDIA GRID Virtual Applications, you must define the product type for the driver&nbsp;in the registry and disable the licensing page in the control panel to prevent users from accidentally changing the product type.</p> 
<b>AWS Partners Invested in Desktop Application Streaming Solutions</b> 
<p>In 2017, AWS Partners invested in efforts to enhance their streaming solutions running on AWS with the goal of satisfying enterprise customers’ needs of migrating desktop applications to AWS. Here are some highlights from AWS Partners&nbsp;that&nbsp;built and optimized&nbsp;products in this space to run on AWS, and provided technical content, labs, and workshops to guide customer adoption of desktop application streaming solutions.</p> 
<p>These offerings can run on top of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) and support other AWS features and services, manage the lifecycle of desktop workloads on AWS, or provide a managed control plane, and/or desktop resource.</p> 
<h3>Fully Managed Solutions Running on AWS</h3> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/06/Frame-Logo-150x150.jpg" />These are turnkey solutions where the mechanism that provisions and manages the lifecycle of desktop resources on AWS, and to the end user, is a managed offering. These solutions address identity, tenant isolation, and data partitioning, and&nbsp;have developed their own intellectual property to automate the offering into Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS).</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Frame&amp;id=001E000000r2gixIAA">Frame</a> is an AWS Standard Technology and Public Sector Partner that provides customers with the ability to spin up secure cloud workspaces in any AWS region. In August 2017, Frame announced <a href="https://blog.fra.me/aws-elastic-gpus-now-on-frame-81935be33903">support for Elastic GPUs and G3 Instance types</a>, and has been testing Elastic GPUs where they have seen solid results with apps such as Google Earth, ANSYS AIM, Siemens SolidEdge, Adobe Photoshop, and more.</p> 
<p>At AWS re:Invent 2017, Frame CEO Nikola Bozinovic presented a session on Elastic GPUs along with AWS Senior Product Manager Letian Feng. The session was titled “Unleash Your Graphics Solutions with the Flexibility of Elastic,” and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd66KQe1ujU&amp;feature=youtu.be#t=12m23s">watch it on the AWS YouTube page</a>.</p> 
<h3>Solutions Running on Amazon EC2 with Managed Resources on AWS</h3> 
<p>These are designed for customers that want to deploy and manage a solution in their own AWS account and scale desktops seamlessly. Additionally, these solutions are designed to work with AWS and provide lifecycle management and governance tools for the desktop resources deployed on AWS.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Citrix&amp;id=001E000000Rl125IAB"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/06/Citrix-Logo-150x150.jpg">Citrix Cloud XenApp and XenDesktop Service</a>&nbsp;that allows for simpler setup and shorter deployment time by using a Citrix-hosted management infrastructure to deploy desktop resources on AWS.</p> 
<p>In May 2017, Citrix and AWS collaborated to provide attendees of Citrix Synergy 2017 a lab where we showcased the Citrix Cloud solution deploying desktops on AWS. A use case customers often ask us about is the ability to run Windows client operating systems on AWS for XenDesktop deployments.

<p>These do not manage the deployment or lifecycle of desktop resources on AWS, but it is possible to use scripting or other automation tools to manage desktop resources. Additionally, these solutions have documented support for their solution to run on AWS.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Parallels&amp;id=001E000000Rl0xdIAB">Parallels</a>&nbsp;is an AWS Standard Technology Partner that provides customers with Parallels Remote Application Server (RAS). This&nbsp;is a comprehensive virtual application and desktop delivery solution that allows employees to access and use applications and data from any device.</p> 
<p>As of September 2017, AWS customers can download RAS as a pre-configured 30-day trial on AWS Marketplace.

<h3>Solutions That Complement Desktop Application Streaming Solutions</h3> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/06/Liquidware-Logo-150x150.jpg" />Depending on the complexity and scalability of an environment, a layering approach may help ease management of the resource plane by adding layers of virtualization between the operating system (OS), application, and user profile. Without layering, all user profile, application, and OS data is managed within the OS image. In this model, any modifications to the OS image, including patching, must be performed on each image. This can be very complex and time consuming at scale.</p> 
<p>These solutions help reduce configuration bloat by managing end user profiles. Depending on the use case, profiles can be non-persistent or persistent, saving user settings configured by the user and providing a unique OS and application experience.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Liquidware%20Inc.&amp;id=001E000001QNLKcIAP">Liquidware</a> is an AWS Advanced Technology Partner that provides customers with workspace environment management tools focused on environment management (ProfileUnity), application layering (FlexApps) and desktop monitoring (StratosphereUX). Liquidware presented at AWS re:Invent 2017&nbsp;and reviewed the benefits of these solutions running on AWS. Their session was titled “Image Management Best Practices for Amazon WorkSpaces,” and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=93&amp;v=KPUDKjUcc5E">watch&nbsp;it on the AWS YouTube page</a>.
