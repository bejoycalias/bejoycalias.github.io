<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Aug 31, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>You can now create and run scalar user-defined functions (UDFs) using SQL in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/">Amazon Redshift</a>. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Using PostgreSQL syntax, you can create custom SQL scalar functions and execute them in parallel across your clusters. For faster performance, we replace the SQL function name with the SQL function code on the leader node, and these are then run as regular SQL in parallel on each node of your cluster. Once defined, you can call these scalar UDFs in any SQL statement. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>To learn more about creating and using scalar UDFs, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/user-defined-functions.html" target="_blank">scalar UDF documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>SQL scalar user-defined functions are now available in all regions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Use <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RollbackConfiguration.html" target="_blank">Rollback Triggers</a>&nbsp;to monitor the state of your application during the stack creation and update process. You can specify the alarms and the thresholds you want AWS CloudFormation to monitor, and if any of the alarms are breached, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack operation to the previous deployed state. </p> 
<p>This feature is available in the following regions: US East (Ohio), US EAST (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), EU (Frankfurt), EU (Ireland), EU (London), and South America (S&atilde;o Paulo).<br /> </p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Aug 31, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>We are pleased to announce that Application Load Balancers can now distribute traffic to AWS resources using their IP addresses as targets in addition to the instance IDs. You can also load balance to resources outside the VPC hosting the load balancer using their IP addresses as targets. This includes resources in peered VPCs, EC2-Classic, and on-premises locations reachable over <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/">AWS Direct Connect</a> or a VPN connection. Load balancing across AWS and on-premises resources using the same load balancer makes it easy for you to migrate-to-cloud, burst-to-cloud, or failover-to-cloud.</p> 
<p>Prior to this launch, when using an instance ID as a target, an EC2 instance could only receive traffic from the load balancer on its primary IP address and primary network interface. This limits hosting multiple applications on the same instance where each application requires different IP address, network interface, or security group. Using IP addresses as targets removes this limitation as the load balancer can route to multiple network interfaces on the same instance. Load balancing using IP addresses also provides flexibility with microservice based architectures, where each application target can now use a known port instead of a random port simplifying inter-application communication. This feature also enables load balancing to your on-premises resources thereby supporting hybrid architectures.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Load balancing using IP addresses is available today for all existing and new Application Load Balancers in all regions. You can get started using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or AWS SDK. &nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Aug 31, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>AWS Direct Connect has now landed in Boston, MA at Markley, One Summer Data Center supporting the US East (N. Virginia) AWS Region. Customers in Boston can now establish a dedicated network connection from their premise to AWS.<br /> </p> 
<p>Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections. Connections are always made to a particular Direct Connect location, and can run at either 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps, or work with a partner to connect at speeds less than 1G.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Instructions on how to set up AWS Direct Connect are available in our <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html" target="_blank">AWS Direct Connect Users Guide</a>. Sign in to your AWS Management Console to order AWS Direct Connect today!</p> 
<b id="Deploy_IBM_MQ_on_the_AWS_Cloud_with_New_Quick_Start"> <a name="Deploy_IBM_MQ_on_the_AWS_Cloud_with_New_Quick_Start"> Deploy IBM MQ on the AWS Cloud with New Quick Start</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Aug 31, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>This new Quick Start automatically deploys a highly available, production-ready IBM MQ server on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in about 30 minutes, into a configuration of your choice.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>IBM MQ is messaging middleware that simplifies and accelerates the integration of diverse applications and business data across multiple platforms. It uses message queues to facilitate the exchange of information, and offers a single messaging solution for cloud, mobile, the Internet of Things (IoT), and on-premises environments.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>By connecting virtually everything, from a simple pair of applications to the most complex business environments, IBM MQ helps you improve business responsiveness, control costs, reduce risk, and gain real-time insight from mobile, IoT, and sensor data.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>AWS offers flexible compute, storage, and database services that provide a scalable, secure cloud platform for running IBM MQ. The IBM MQ service on AWS will support client messaging applications from within your VPC, from trusted addresses on the Internet, and via a VPN from your on-premises environment.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This Quick Start deploys IBM MQ into a virtual private cloud (VPC) in your AWS account. You can build a new VPC for IBM MQ, or deploy the software into your existing VPC. The automated deployment provisions an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance running IBM MQ in an Auto Scaling group, Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) for distributed storage, and Elastic Load Balancing to automatically distribute connections to the active IBM MQ server.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The deployment and configuration tasks are automated by AWS CloudFormation templates that you can customize during launch. You can also use the templates as a starting point for your own implementation, by downloading them from the <a href="https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-ibm-mq" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Aug 31, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>You can now provide synonyms for slot values in Amazon Lex. With the synonym functionality, you can specify multiple synonyms for a slot value in your chatbot. The synonyms specified are resolved to the corresponding slot values. For example, if the slot value is “comedy”, with “funny” and “humorous” specified as synonyms, then user input of “funny” will now be resolved to “comedy”. You can optimize your business logic to implement code for just the slot value instead of entire set of synonyms. In addition, the chatbot automatically resolves minor variants of the slot value to the original value without the user having to explicitly specify the synonym. For example, if “pineapple” is one of the slot values and the user value is “pineapples” then slot is resolved to the value “pineapple”. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can also now validate user input and restrict it to a fixed set of values. You can enable this by configuring the slot resolution strategy so that the slot is resolved only if the user value is the same as one of the slot values or the synonym. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>These new features are available with Amazon Lex in the US East (N. Virginia) AWS region. Visit <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/howitworks-custom-slots.html" target="_blank">the Amazon Lex documentation</a> to learn more about the features. &nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Aug 30, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>We’re excited to announce new features to the growing portfolio of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/details/#storage-management">Amazon S3 Storage Management</a> capabilities to help you better analyze and manage your storage. You can now utilize the following new features in AWS GovCloud (US):&nbsp;</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>S3 Object Tagging</b> – With S3 Object Tagging, you can manage and control access for Amazon S3 objects. S3 Object Tags are key-value pairs applied to S3 objects which can be created, updated or deleted at any time during the lifetime of the object. With these, you’ll have the ability to create Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, setup S3 Lifecycle policies, and customize storage metrics. These object-level tags can then manage transitions between storage classes and expire objects in the background.&nbsp;</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li><b>S3 Analytics, Storage Class Analysis</b> – With storage class analysis, you can analyze storage access patterns and transition the right data to the right storage class. This new S3 Analytics feature automatically identifies the optimal lifecycle policy to transition less frequently accessed storage to Standard – Infrequent Access storage. You can configure a storage class analysis policy to monitor an entire bucket, a prefix, or object tag. Once an infrequent access pattern is observed, you can easily create a new lifecycle age policy based on the results. Storage class analysis also provides daily visualizations of your storage usage in the AWS Management Console.&nbsp;</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li><b>S3 Inventory</b> – You can simplify and speed up business workflows and big data jobs using S3 Inventory, which provides a scheduled alternative to Amazon S3’s synchronous List API. S3 Inventory provides a CSV (Comma Separated Values) flat-file output of your objects and their corresponding metadata on a daily or weekly basis for an S3 bucket or a shared prefix.</li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
<li><b>S3 CloudWatch Metrics</b> – Understand and improve the performance of your applications that use Amazon S3 by monitoring and alarming on 13 new S3 CloudWatch Metrics. You can receive 1-minute CloudWatch Metrics, set CloudWatch alarms, and access CloudWatch dashboards to view real-time operations and performance such as bytes downloaded and the 4xx HTTP response count of your Amazon S3 storage. For web and mobile applications that depend on cloud storage, these let you quickly identify and act on operational issues. By default, 1-minute metrics are available at the S3 bucket level. You also have the flexibility to define a filter for the metrics collected using a shared prefix or object tag, allowing you to align metrics to specific business applications, workflows, or internal organizations.</li> 
</ul>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Aug 29, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>We are excited to announce the general availability of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/elastic-gpus/">Amazon EC2 Elastic GPUs</a>. Elastic GPUs allow you to easily attach low-cost graphics acceleration to a wide range of EC2 instances over the network. Simply choose an instance with the right amount of compute, memory, and storage for your application, and then use Elastic GPUs to add the GPU resources needed to accelerate the graphics performance of your application for a fraction of the cost of standalone graphics instances.</p> 
<p>Amazon EC2 Elastic GPUs make it easy to attach graphics acceleration to existing Amazon EC2 instances in much the same way as attaching Amazon EBS volumes. With Elastic GPUs, you can configure the right amount of graphics acceleration to your particular workload without being constrained by fixed hardware configurations and limited GPU selection. Elastic GPUs support OpenGL 3.3 and offer up to 8GiB of GPU memory, making them ideally suited for any workload that needs a small amount of additional GPU such as virtual desktops, gaming, industrial design, or HPC visualization.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon EC2 Elastic GPUs come in four sizes and are available in the US East (N. Virginia) and US East (Ohio) Regions.

<b id="Amazon_Aurora_Supports_Fast_Database_Cloning"> <a name="Amazon_Aurora_Supports_Fast_Database_Cloning"> Amazon Aurora Supports Fast Database Cloning</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Aug 29, 2017</span> </p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/">Amazon Aurora MySQL</a> users can now create quick, efficient database clones. Following on the heels of the original <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/06/amazon-aurora-introduces-database-cloning-capabilities/">database cloning announcement</a> in June 2017, copy operation time has been substantially reduced so entire multi-terabyte database clusters can be cloned in minutes.</p> 
<p>Cloning is useful for a number of purposes including application development, testing, database updates, and running analytical queries. Immediate availability of data can significantly accelerate your software development and upgrade projects, and make analytics more accurate.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can clone an Amazon Aurora database with just a few clicks in the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds" target="_blank">AWS Management Console</a>, without impacting the production environment. The clone is distributed and replicated across 3 availability zones. You can create multiple clones of the same database, and even clones of clones.</p> 
<p>A cloning operation does not incur any storage charges, so you can create as many database copies as you need and only pay for the instance-hours used. You’ll be charged for additional storage space only if you make data changes. Watch the Fast Database Cloning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdhSG25gSZA" target="_blank">launch video</a> and refer to the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Aurora.Managing.Clone.html" target="_blank">Amazon Aurora documentation</a> for more information.</p> 
<p>Amazon Aurora is a MySQL-compatible relational database that powers some of the world’s biggest database deployments. See <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/pricing/">Amazon Aurora Pricing</a> for regional availability.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Aug 29, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) now allows customers to expand their VPCs by adding secondary IPv4 address ranges (CIDRs) to their VPCs. Customers can add the secondary CIDR blocks to the VPC directly from the console or by using the CLI after they have created the VPC with the primary CIDR block. Similar to the primary CIDR block, secondary CIDR blocks are also supported by all the AWS services including Elastic Load Balancing and NAT Gateway.<br /> </p> 
<p>This feature has two key benefits. First, customers, who are launching more and more resources in their VPCs, can now scale up their VPCs on-demand. Second, customers no longer have to over-allocate private IPv4 space to their VPCs - they can allocate only what is required at the time, and later expand it as needed. With these benefits, this feature can make it significantly easier for customers to manage their private IPv4 address space.<br /> </p> 
<p>There is no additional charge to use this feature. This feature is available in all AWS regions except GovCloud and AWS China (Beijing) regions.<br /> </p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Aug 28, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon EC2 Systems Manager can now be used to report and take action on configuration compliance for Patch Manager, State Manager, and custom compliance types.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, you could only view patch compliance information for instances patched using Patch Manager. Now, you can also view configuration compliance information for instances based on the defined state from a State Manager document and Association. For example, you can define a State Manager Association that tests for specific firewall port settings or the presence of an application, then run a report to check if your instances are in compliance with that defined configuration. Additionally, you can define custom configuration compliance types, such as when you want to report if specific registry settings have been disabled.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Compliance reports are available in single accounts. You can view compliance reports cross-account and cross-region by setting up a resource data sync to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). You can also visualize this data by using Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Finally, you can auto-remediate your instances based on compliance reports. If instances are out of compliance, you can trigger an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule to bring them into compliance.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Systems Manager is available in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">all commercial regions and GovCloud</a>. </p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Aug 28, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Deadline 10, our powerful and easy to use render management system, is now available to all customers. Deadline 10 allows customers the freedom to easily access any combination of on-premises or cloud-based resources, and features new, cost effective pricing for broader accessibility.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Rendering is a highly distributed compute-intensive process with dependencies between render jobs and digital assets. The rendering pipeline is comprised of thousands of client instantiations of the same rendering process. Deadline is a pipeline manager that orchestrates this distributed job.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Since the Thinkbox acquisition by Amazon Web Services (AWS), many customers have asked us how to make the rendering experience in the cloud as simple as the one they have on-premises, while still leveraging the elasticity and flexibility of cloud. While we stay committed to delivering new and improved capabilities for on-premises deployments, like dynamic licensing and improved remote connection server, Deadline 10 is our first step into making rendering in the cloud a few click process through the new AWS Portal feature in Deadline. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Deadline 10 includes usage-based licensing on AWS with Deadline for Autodesk 3ds Max, Maya and Arnold through the <a href="https://marketplace.thinkboxsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Thinkbox marketplace</a>. Chaos Group’s V-Ray has also been added to the marketplace, joining current Thinkbox partners - The Foundry’s NUKE and KATANA, Maxwell Render, Next Limit RealFlow, NVIDIA Iray and Mental Ray, Redshift and Peregrine Labs’ Yeti. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Enabling simple and secure expansion of on-prem render farms, Deadline 10 natively integrates with AWS via customers’ existing AWS accounts. It automatically connects to customers’ on-prem farms, tags AWS instances for tracking and synchronizes with local asset servers automatically to ensure all appropriate files have been transferred before rendering begins. With flexible third-party licensing options, Deadline 10 customers using AWS resources can purchase software licenses from the Thinkbox marketplace, deploy existing licenses or leverage a combination of the two. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>The new remote connection server feature enhances the secure connection to and interactions with remote and cloud-based render farms over public internet, reducing communication overhead and accelerating data transfers. Dynamic licensing allows Deadline slaves to switch between floating licenses and usage based licensing so that users can expand render farms with AWS Portal without having to configure render nodes. By using a new unlimited option for third-party usage based licensing, customers can grow render farms elastically by tapping AWS resources.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Deadline 10 is now available for usage based license customers; a new license is needed for traditional floating license users. Pricing for yearly Deadline licenses has been updated to $48 USD annually. Perpetual Deadline licenses continue to be available upon request or users may transition to yearly licenses.

You no longer have to use an account-specific URL to sign in as an&nbsp;IAM user. However, the account-specific URL you have used in the past to sign in will continue to work.<br /> </p> 
<p> In the first step of the new sign-in experience, root users enter their email address; IAM users enter their <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html">account ID (or account alias</a>). In the second step, root users enter their password; IAM users enter their user name and password. If you enabled <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa/">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA) for your account, you will then be prompted to enter the code from your MFA device. After successful authentication, you will be signed in to the AWS Management Console, and the homepage will be displayed.</p> 
<p> For more information about the changes to how you sign in to your AWS account as a root user or IAM user, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/now-available-improvements-to-how-you-sign-in-to-your-aws-account/">Improvements to How You Sign In to Your AWS Account</a> on the AWS Security Blog.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Aug 25, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) now supports the use of setgid and sticky bit special permissions on directories. This new capability allows you to further customize access permissions for shared directories across a set of file system users. When the&nbsp;setgid&nbsp;permission is set on a directory, files created in the directory belong to the group associated with the directory (instead of the group to which the user creating the file belongs). The&nbsp;sticky bit&nbsp;is used to restrict deletion and renaming of files to the owner of the file or directory or to the root user.<br /> </p> 
<p>Amazon EFS also now supports running binary files that are configured as execute-only. This capability allows you to configure access permissions for executable files such that they can be only executed and not read or written.</p> 
<p> These features are available on all new and existing file systems at no additional cost in all Amazon EFS regions. Please visit <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/efs/pricing/">here</a> to see the full list of supported regions.</p>

<p> AWS Budgets lets customers set custom budgets and receive alerts if their costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) their budgeted amount. </p> 
<p> Starting today, customers can now monitor and receive alerts when their Reserved Instance (“RI”) utilization falls below the threshold they define. RI utilization tracks the percentage of purchased RI hours that were used by matching instances, and can be measured over a daily, monthly, quarterly, or yearly cadence. For example, customers can monitor RI utilization either at an aggregate level (e.g., monthly utilization of a customer’s entire RI fleet) or at a more granular level of detail (e.g., daily utilization of m4.large instances running on a Linux operating system in a particular region). Customers can then define up to five notifications per budget, and each notification can be sent to ten email subscribers and broadcast to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic of their choice.</p> 
<p>Please note that RI utilization alerts only support Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (“Amazon EC2”) resources at this time.

<p> Amazon EC2 Systems Manager State Manager can now be used to trigger Amazon CloudWatch Events, Automation can be used as a CloudWatch Events target, you can now keep track of State Manager association changes, and you can use the new approve action type in Automation.</p> 
<p> Previously, Systems Manager State Manager could not trigger Amazon CloudWatch Events. Now, you can use CloudWatch Events to receive notifications when the status of a Systems Manager State Manager association or instance changes. For example, you can be notified if an association is in a failed state and use an AWS Lambda function to stop that instance and start a new one. You can also trigger a Systems Manager Automation workflow, helping you to quickly respond to system events. Automation workflows can be triggered on a fixed schedule or by a change in your AWS environment.</p> 
<p> Changes to associations in Systems Manager State Manager can now be recorded. Previously, when you edited associations, you could not go back and review older association settings. Now, associations are versioned, and can be named using human-readable strings, allowing you to see a trail of association changes. You can also perform rate-based scheduling, which allows you to schedule associations more granularly. </p> 
<p> Approve is a new Systems Manager Automation action type. Previously, you could not pause an automation workflow and request a manager or stakeholder approval. Now, you can use the Approve action to request one or more principals for approval or rejection of a step. The principal can be an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or a role. Once the required number of approvals are reached, Automation will continue to the next step.</p> 
<p> Systems Manager is available in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">all commercial regions and GovCloud</a>. </p>

To learn more, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ses/amazon-ses-now-offers-dedicated-ip-addresses/">see our blog post about dedicated IP addresses</a>.</p> 
<p>If you lease several dedicated IP addresses for use with Amazon SES, you can organize these addresses into groups, called pools. You can then associate each pool with a configuration set. When you send an email that specifies a configuration set, that email will be sent from the IP addresses in the associated pool.</p> 
<p>Dedicated IP pools are especially useful for customers who send several different types of email using Amazon SES. For example, if you use Amazon SES to send both marketing emails and transactional emails, you can create a pool for marketing emails and another for transactional emails. </p> 
<p>By using dedicated IP pools, you can isolate the sender reputations for each of these types of communications. Dedicated IP pools gives you complete control over the sender reputations of the dedicated IP addresses you lease from Amazon SES.</p> 
<p>Amazon SES Dedicated IP pools are now available in the following AWS Regions: us-west-2 (Oregon), us-east-1 (Virginia), and eu-west-1 (Ireland).</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Aug 17, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Starting today, customers can access the redesigned Cost Explorer interface, which sits on top of a newly-optimized backend querying engine. Customers can now take advantage of a more robust, and performant filtering experience that has been enhanced to allow customers greater flexibility over the information they include or exclude from their analyses. For example, customers can create a view that only includes costs associated with EC2 instance running hours in Availability Zone “us-east-1a” but does not include costs associated with instance types in the m4 family. Customers also benefit from a new consolidated date picker that lets them choose a custom or preset time range (e.g., month-to-date), while also allowing them to forecast forward over user-defined intervals. Once customers reach a view that they would like to refer back to, they can use the improved report management functionality to save up to 50 custom reports per account.</p> 
<p>Additionally, paying accounts can now control which members of their billing family have access to Cost Explorer using the new access control settings. Paying accounts can further refine the type of cost data to which their linked accounts have access (e.g., exclude refunds and credits from view).</p> 
<p>To get started with Cost Explorer, you can go <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cost-reports/home?#/custom">here&nbsp;</a>or refer to the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-explorer-what-is.html">Analyzing your costs using Cost Explorer</a> technical documentation.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Aug 14, 2017</span> </p> 
<p> Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) now allows you to encrypt your data at rest using keys managed through AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Encryption and decryption are handled seamlessly, so you don’t have to modify your applications to access your data.</p> 
<p> When you create a new file system, you can choose to enable encryption via the AWS Management Console or API. To encrypt your data, you can use the default EFS key automatically created in your account or a key you generated.</p> 
<p> Encryption at rest is available at no additional cost in all Amazon EFS regions. Please visit <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/efs/pricing/">here</a> to see the full list of supported regions. AWS KMS usage is billed at standard rates.</p> 
<p>For more information, read the Amazon EFS Encryption <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-encryption-at-rest-for-amazon-elastic-file-system-efs/">blog</a> and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/efs/faq/#encryption">Amazon EFS Encryption FAQ</a>.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Aug 14, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>AWS Config now supports two new managed rules to detect overly permissive Amazon S3 bucket policies. Previously, you had to manually examine the policies tied to each of your S3 buckets to ensure proper access configurations are in place. Now, you can use Config rules to automatically check your S3 buckets for unrestricted public read or write access. With these new rules, you can check Access Control Lists (ACLs) and policies attached to your S3 buckets, flag non-compliant resources, and receive Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notifications when your bucket permissions change.</p>

<p>AWS SAM Local is a CLI tool that allows you to locally test and debug your AWS Lambda functions defined by AWS <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model" target="_blank">Serverless Application Model</a> (SAM) templates. Today, SAM Local supports Lambda functions written in Node.js, Java, and Python. SAM Local is available today in beta. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, you were limited to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/developer-tools/#sdkide" target="_blank">AWS Toolkits</a> for Eclipse and Visual Studio if you wanted to perform local testing for your Lambda functions. Now, you can use SAM Local with the IDE of your choice to locally test and debug your AWS SAM-defined Lambda functions. The SAM Local Event Payload Generator enables you to simulate event triggers for your Lambda functions. SAM Local also lets you make local API calls to invoke functions that are fronted by Amazon API Gateway. After SAM Local executes your Lambda functions, you can view the responses and logs on your local machine. SAM Local leverages the <a href="https://github.com/lambci/docker-lambda" target="_blank">docker-lambda</a> Docker images to run your code in a sandbox that simulates the Lambda execution environment.</p> 
<p>SAM Local is open sourced under the Apache License 2.0. You can use it with AWS Lambda in all regions where Lambda is available. This includes US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (N.

<p>AWS Marketplace is a curated software catalog which allows customers to instantly deploy over 3,800 third-party AMI, SaaS, and Desktop software solutions across 35 product categories. Starting today, AWS Marketplace customers can now analyze and control their costs and usage via AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, and the AWS Cost &amp; Usage Report (“CUR”).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Customers can now visualize their AWS Marketplace costs and usage in Cost Explorer, dive deeper into their usage patterns using the CUR, and set budgets on their AWS Marketplace costs and usage. To help customers get started analyzing AWS Marketplace costs and usage, Cost Explorer now provides the AWS Marketplace default report, which allows customers to track their overall spending patterns, both at a high level (e.g., view total cost and usage across all AWS Marketplace services) and for highly-specific requests (e.g., a certain AWS Marketplace service within a specific linked account for a particular region). From there, customers can use the CUR to dive deeper into their comprehensive cost and usage information and inspect their information at an hourly level of detail. Finally, customers can take action on their insights by setting budgets on specific aspects of their AWS Marketplace costs and usage, and receive alerts when they exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) their budgeted amount. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>To get started analyzing and managing your AWS Marketplace costs and usage, please access the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/">AWS Cost Management webpages</a> or the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/marketplace-whatis.html" target="_blank">technical documentation</a>.</p>

<b id="AWS_Encryption_SDK_now_supports_data_key_caching"> <a name="AWS_Encryption_SDK_now_supports_data_key_caching"> AWS Encryption SDK now supports data key caching</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Aug 10, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>The AWS Encryption SDK is an encryption library that helps make it easier for you to implement encryption best practices in your application. It enables you to focus on the core functionality of your application, rather than on how to best encrypt and decrypt your data.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Data key caching lets you reuse the data keys that protect your data, instead of generating a new data key for each encryption operation. Data key caching can improve performance, reduce cost, and help you stay within service limits as your application scales. In particular, this feature might help if your application is hitting the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/limits.html#requests-per-second" target="_blank">requests-per-second limit</a> and <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/" target="_blank">raising the limit</a> does not solve the problem.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Data key caching is an optional feature of the AWS Encryption SDK that you should use cautiously. Cryptographic best practices discourage excessive reuse of data keys. Use data key caching only when it is required to meet your performance goals. Then, use the data key caching <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/thresholds.html" target="_blank">security thresholds</a> to ensure that you use the minimum amount of caching required to meet your cost and performance goals. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>For more information about data key caching in the AWS Encryption SDK, you can read the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-encryption-sdk-how-to-decide-if-data-key-caching-is-right-for-your-application/" target="_blank">AWS Security Blog post</a> and the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/data-key-caching.html" target="_blank">data key caching section</a> in the AWS Encryption SDK documentation.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Aug 9, 2017</span> </p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-directory/">Amazon Cloud Directory</a> now enables you to optimize your directory searches by only searching a subset of your directory, using a schema facet. For example, instead of searching across all the user objects in your directory, you can search a subset of your directory by searching only the user objects that contain an employee facet. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>A facet is a group of attributes defined in a schema. Using facets, you can extend your schemas to create different classes of objects. For example, you can extend a user schema by creating different facets for employees, vendors, and customers. You can also use facets to enable multiple applications to share a single directory safely by creating unique facets for each of your different applications.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With Cloud Directory, you can build flexible, cloud-native directories for organizing hierarchies of data along multiple dimensions. You also can create directories for a variety of use cases, such as organizational charts, course catalogs, and device registries. For example, you can create an organizational chart that you can navigate through separate hierarchies for reporting structure, location, and cost center.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There is no additional charge to use facets in your Cloud Directory searches. Cloud Directory is available in the US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), EU (Ireland), EU (London), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and Asia Pacific (Singapore) Regions.</p>
