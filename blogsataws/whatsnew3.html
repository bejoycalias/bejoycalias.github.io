<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Feb 28, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Powered by advanced deep learning technologies, Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech. The Text-to-Speech service is now available in the <a href="http://www.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us">AWS GovCloud (US) region</a>, Amazon’s isolated cloud region built for sensitive data and regulated workloads.</p> 
<p>With this new region, Amazon Polly is now operating at sixteen AWS regions worldwide. You can learn more about our growing footprint at the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">Global Infrastructure page</a>. In the meantime, we encourage our government customers and their partners to take advantage of the new AWS GovCloud (US) region for Amazon Polly. </p> 
<p> For more information about the service, please visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/polly/">Amazon Polly product page</a>, or simply log in to <a href="http://console.aws.amazon.com/polly">Amazon Polly console</a> and try the service. &nbsp;</p> 
<b id="Amazon_WorkDocs_Now_Offers_Data_Retention_Capabilities"> <a name="Amazon_WorkDocs_Now_Offers_Data_Retention_Capabilities"> Amazon WorkDocs Now Offers Data Retention Capabilities</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Feb 28, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon WorkDocs now allows you to specify a site-wide data retention policy for your users’ files and folders. Applying a data retention policy allows you to recover user-deleted files and folders that have been removed from user recycle bins, during the retention policy period. Retention policies are applicable to all files and folders in a WorkDocs site, and the retention policy can be adjusted from the default of 60 days to any value from 0 to 365 days. Using a data retention policy helps you to address your compliance and business policy requirements for retaining and disposing of your content.</p> 
<p>You can apply a retention policy to your WorkDocs site using the Administrator console. Simply set the number of days you would like files and folders to be retained in the recovery bin settings. When files and folders are deleted by a user, they are stored in the user’s recycle bin for 30 days. At the end of this period, they are moved to the recovery bin, which is visible only to site administrators. Site administrators can restore files and folders in the recovery bin to an alternate location anytime during the retention period. Files not restored during the retention period are permanently deleted. To learn more about how to use data retention policies, please visit <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/adminguide/admin_dashboard_retention.html" target="_blank">Recovery Bin Retention</a>.</p> 
<p>You can use site-wide retention policies starting today in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS regions</a> where WorkDocs is offered. To learn more about WorkDocs, or to start your 30-day trial, please visit <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/workdocs/">Amazon WorkDocs</a>.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Feb 28, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon Rekognition is now available in the AWS Asia Pacific (Tokyo) and Asia Pacific (Sydney) Regions.</p> 
<p>Amazon Rekognition is a deep learning-based service that makes it easy to add image and video analysis to your applications. Rekognition Image API allows you to detect objects, scenes, faces and inappropriate content; extract text; recognize celebrities; and search and compare faces, in images. Rekognition Video API allows you to track people; detect objects, scenes, activities and inappropriate content; recognize celebrities; and search faces, in video. You can use Rekognition Video to search faces in video stored in Amazon S3 in the AWS Asia Pacific (Sydney) region and in video stored in Amazon S3 or in real-time streaming through Amazon Kinesis video streams in the AWS Asia Pacific (Tokyo) region.</p> 
<p>With Amazon Rekognition, you only pay for the images you analyze, the amount of video time analyzed and the face metadata you store. There are no minimum fees and there are no upfront commitments. </p> 
<p>Amazon Rekognition is also currently available in US East (Northern Virginia), US West (Oregon) US East (Ohio) and EU (Ireland) regions. To get started with Rekognition, simply log in to the <a href="http://console.aws.amazon.com/rekognition">Rekognition console</a> to try the service. Learn more about features and ideal use cases by reading our <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition">Documentation</a>. The client SDK is available <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/developers/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<b id="Auto_Scaling_in_Amazon_SageMaker_is_now_Available"> <a name="Auto_Scaling_in_Amazon_SageMaker_is_now_Available"> Auto Scaling in Amazon SageMaker is now Available</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Feb 28, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>You can now configure the Auto Scaling of your endpoints from the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker">Amazon SageMaker console</a>, the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_PutScalingPolicy.html">AWS Auto Scaling API</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/application-autoscaling/index.html">the AWS SDK</a>, making capacity management easier. Using Amazon SageMaker, you can specify the number and type of instances per endpoint to provide the scale that you need for your inferences. If your inference volume changes, you can change the number and/or type of instances that back each endpoint to accommodate that change. By using Auto Scaling, you can automatically adjust your inference capacity to maintain predictable performance at a low cost. From the Amazon SageMaker console, you configure the minimum and maximum number of instances for your endpoint, and then select the throughput per instance. Amazon SageMaker will monitor your deployed models to automatically adjust the instance count and keep throughput within desired levels, in response to changes in application traffic. This makes it easier to manage models in production, and it can help reduce the cost of deployed models.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Auto Scaling in Amazon SageMaker is available in the US East (N. Virginia &amp; Ohio), EU (Ireland), and U.S. West (Oregon) AWS regions. Visit <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/endpoint-auto-scaling.html">the documentation</a> for more details on automatically scaling models in Amazon SageMaker.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Feb 22, 2018</span> </p> 
<p> Network Load Balancer can now distribute requests regardless of Availability Zone with the support of cross-zone load balancing. This feature allows Network Load Balancer to route incoming requests to applications that are deployed across multiple Availability Zones.</p> 
<p>Network Load Balancer relies on Domain Name System (DNS) to distribute requests from clients to the Load Balancer nodes deployed in multiple Availability Zones. Prior to this support, Network Load Balancer routed requests only to targets located in the same Availability Zone. This meant that in scenarios where the clients were caching the DNS information of a zonal Network Load Balancer, some targets could receive a disproportionally higher number of inbound requests.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In addition, if you did not have an equal number of healthy targets in each of the Availability Zones (e.g. if you had taken some targets down for maintenance), your requests would be balanced across a smaller number of healthy targets in the affected Availability Zones - meaning that you would have to closely monitor and adjust your target capacity.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you enable cross-zone load balancing, you no longer have to worry that clients caching DNS information will result in requests being distributed unevenly. With this launch, requests are distributed equally to your targets regardless of the Availability Zone in which they are located. This feature makes it easier for you to deploy and manage your applications across multiple Availability Zones. When you enable cross-zone load balancing for your Network Load Balancer, regional data charges apply. &nbsp;</p>

<b id="Amazon_EC2_Auto_Scaling_Adds_Support_for_Service-Linked_Roles"> <a name="Amazon_EC2_Auto_Scaling_Adds_Support_for_Service-Linked_Roles"> Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Adds Support for Service-Linked Roles</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Feb 20, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Today, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling is introducing support for using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role">service-linked roles</a>, a new type of role that allows you to easily delegate permissions to AWS services.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>EC2 Auto Scaling service-linked roles are predefined by EC2 Auto Scaling and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf. Some of the actions that EC2 Auto Scaling performs on your behalf include launching and terminating EC2 instances or creating Amazon CloudWatch alarms when you create a target tracking scaling policy. EC2 Auto Scaling will automatically create a default EC2 Auto Scaling service-linked role in your account if one does not already exist when you create an EC2 Auto Scaling group. Alternatively, you can create a service-linked role other than the default through IAM and then pass it to the EC2 Auto Scaling group.<br /> </p> 
<p>Unlike a normal IAM role, you cannot delete the service-linked role if it is still in use by one or more EC2 Auto Scaling groups. This protects you from inadvertently revoking permissions required by EC2 Auto Scaling. The addition of service-linked roles to EC2 Auto Scaling also helps with monitoring and auditing requirements in AWS CloudTrail by logging actions performed by EC2 Auto Scaling against the respective service-linked role.</p> 
<p>Service-linked roles for EC2 Auto Scaling will be enabled in all public <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS regions</a> and in the AWS GovCloud (US) region over the next few weeks. There is no action required from any EC2 Auto Scaling customers and you can continue using the service the way you do today. For existing EC2 Auto Scaling customers, EC2 Auto Scaling will add a default EC2 Auto Scaling service-linked role in your account and your existing Auto Scaling groups will be updated to use this role over the next few weeks. You can learn more about how EC2 Auto Scaling uses service-linked roles by referring to our <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/autoscaling-service-linked-role.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.<br /> </p>

<p>AWS OpsWorks Stacks event sources are now available in Amazon CloudWatch Events, which you can use to trigger events or notifications.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, you had to orchestrate calls to multiple APIs to trigger events in response to OpsWorks Stacks events. Now, you can use CloudWatch Events to trigger an event when an OpsWorks Stacks instance, deployment, or command state changes. For example, you can trigger an event when an instance changes from an online to stopped state, or when an application deployment succeeds. You can also use CloudWatch Events to send alerts to notify you of potential issues.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>AWS OpsWorks Stacks is available in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), US West (N. California), South America (Sao Paulo), EU (Ireland), EU (Frankfurt), EU (London), EU (Paris), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Seoul), and Asia Pacific (Mumbai) public regions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inter-Region VPC Peering allows VPC resources like Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon RDS databases and AWS Lambda functions running in different AWS Regions to communicate with each other using private IP addresses, without requiring gateways, VPN connections or separate physical hardware. It provides a simple and cost-effective way to share resources between regions or replicate data for geographic redundancy. Built on the same horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available technology that powers VPC today, Inter-Region VPC Peering encrypts inter-region traffic with no single point of failure or bandwidth bottleneck. Traffic using Inter-Region VPC Peering always stays on the global AWS backbone and never traverses the public internet, thereby reducing threat vectors, such as common exploits and DDoS attacks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Data transferred across Inter-Region VPC Peering connections is charged at the standard inter-region data transfer rates. &nbsp;</p>

<p>You can now export and import your <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lex/">Amazon Lex</a> chatbot schema to simplify the process of replicating your chatbot for development and deployment.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon Lex now provides the ability to export and import your Amazon Lex chatbot definition as a JSON file. The JSON configuration file contains the structure of your Amazon Lex chatbot, including the intent schema with utterances, slots, prompts and slot-types. Once you export the bot schema file, you can then modify and import it into to the same account or a different account. The import/export functionality simplifies the process of replicating your chatbot when developing and deploying your application. For example, as part of the deployment process, you can export the chatbot from your development account and import it into the production account. Similarly, you can use the functionality to replicate the chatbot to another region as you set up a highly available multi-region architecture.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The import and export feature is available today in the U.S. East (N. Virginia) and EU West (Ireland) AWS Regions.</p>

<p>In December 2017, we announced that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/longer-resource-ids-in-2018-for-amazon-ec2-amazon-ebs-and-amazon-vpc/" target="_blank">Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and AWS Storage Gateway resources will have longer identifiers</a> to support the ongoing growth of Amazon Web Services. Starting today, you can opt in to using longer IDs using APIs or the AWS Management Console.</p> 
<p>From now until the end of June 2018, you can test your systems with the longer format and opt in when you are ready. After June 2018, all new resources will be created with longer IDs by default. Note that the new format will only apply to newly created resources; your existing resources won't be affected. We strongly recommend testing your systems and opting in to the longer ID format across all of your accounts before the end of June 2018.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The current format is a resource identifier followed by an 8-character string. The new format will be the same resource identifier followed by a 17-character string. For example, today, your VPC has a resource identifier like “vpc-1234abc0”. After July 2018, a new VPC will be assigned an identifier like “vpc-1234567890abcdef0”.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Feb 8, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Today, Amazon GameLift introduces backfill functionality for FlexMatch, a powerful matchmaking service that enables you to match players together based on rules you define.&nbsp;Whether you choose to build your matches based on player skill, latency, or some other custom criteria, FlexMatch allows you to build robust and flexible matchmaking pipelines to suit your desired gaming experience.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With the new backfill capabilities, FlexMatch now finds players to join a game session that is already in progress, using the same custom criteria used to populate the original game session. This ensures that when a player drops from an existing multiplayer session, you can backfill the empty slot with the most appropriate new player for that match and deliver a gaming experience that is always fast, full and fun for your players.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon GameLift’s FlexMatch lets you configure custom matchmaking rule sets so you can automatically group players together in a way that strikes your ideal balance between match quality and player wait time. FlexMatch automatically routes grouped players into a game session queue, which places the match in the AWS region that best balances low player latency and high server utilization. To ensure players are efficiently placed into game sessions, you can also configure FlexMatch to automatically expand matching criteria if wait time crosses a custom threshold so that players can quickly join the next best game.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon GameLift is a dedicated game server hosting and matchmaking solution for games. It is available in 14 AWS regions and supports all major game engines including Amazon Lumberyard, Unreal Engine, Unity, and custom C++ and C# game engines.

<p>You can now define a response for your <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lex">Amazon Lex</a> chatbot directly from <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lex/">the AWS Management Console</a>. A response consists of messages dynamically selected from a group of pre-defined messages, populated by the developer. Messages in these message groups can be simple text, or you can use custom markup. In addition, you can also display <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/ex-resp-card.html">a response card</a> as part of the response. The responses capability simplifies building dynamic conversations with Amazon Lex.&nbsp; In addition, you can use Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) in a text response.</p> 
<p>To define responses in Amazon Lex, by example, if we are building a chatbot that takes car and hotel reservations, you might build three message groups. The first message group could contain different ways the bot could greet the user: “Hello”, “Hi”, “Greetings”. The second message group could contain the different forms of introduction: “My name is ReservationBot”, “I am ReservationBot”, “This is ReservationBot”. And the third message group could communicate the capabilities: “I can help with car rentals and hotel reservations”, “You can do your car rentals and hotel reservations with me”, “Currently I can support car rentals and hotel reservations.” Amazon Lex can use one message from each of these message groups to dynamically build a response in a conversation. A sample response, then, would be, “Hello! My name is ReservationBot. I can help with car rentals and hotel reservations”.</p> 
<p>In addition to supporting SSML in speech response, Amazon Lex now supports SSML in a text response. You can use SSML response as input to a Text-to- Speech (TTS) engine to personalize conversations with end users. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/userguide/text-to-speech.html" target="_blank">Amazon Connect customers can now use SSML</a> when leveraging an Amazon Lex chatbot as part of their contact center experience to control aspects of speech, such as pronunciation, volume, and speech rate.<br /> </p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Feb 8, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon DynamoDB encryption at rest helps you secure your application data in Amazon DynamoDB tables further using AWS-managed encryption keys stored in AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Encryption at rest is fully transparent to the user with all DynamoDB queries working seamlessly on encrypted data. With this new capability, it has never been easier to use DynamoDB for security-sensitive applications with strict encryption compliance and regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Encryption at rest expands on DynamoDB’s existing security controls i.e., data protection and security using TLS endpoints for encryption-in-transit, a client-side library for end-to-end encryption, and fine-grained access control using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Last year, AWS added VPC Endpoints for DynamoDB to ensure your VPC and DynamoDB connection remains closed and isolated from the Internet, and to enable restricting access to DynamoDB only from your authorized applications.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>DynamoDB encryption at rest is generally available in EU (Ireland), US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), and US West (Oregon) at no extra cost (KMS encryption key usage charges apply). With today’s release, encryption at rest is available for new DynamoDB tables. Furthermore, backups of encrypted DynamoDB tables are also fully encrypted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments address the high availability requirements of enterprise-grade production workloads. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/">Amazon RDS for SQL Server</a> now supports Multi-AZ in the Asia Pacific (Singapore) region. This new option leverages SQL Server Mirroring technology, with additional improvements.</p> 
<p>AWS Availability Zones (AZs) are physically separate locations with independent infrastructure engineered to be insulated from failures in other Availability Zones. The Multi-AZ deployment option provides enhanced availability and data durability by automatically replicating database updates between two AZs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can create SQL Server database instances with the Multi-AZ option or modify existing instances. Amazon RDS will automatically provision a primary database in one AZ and maintain a synchronous &quot;standby&quot; replica in a different AZ. In the event of planned database maintenance or unplanned service disruption, Amazon RDS will automatically fail over the database to the up-to-date replica so that database operations can resume quickly without any manual intervention.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon RDS for SQL Server makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale SQL Server deployments in the cloud. For more information about Multi-AZ deployments, please see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_SQLServer.html#SQLServer.Concepts.General.Mirroring" target="_blank">documentation</a>.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Feb 8, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Today, AWS announced the ability to filter load balancers and target groups by tags in the Elastic Load Balancing Console. Tag-based filtering enables you to view only the load balancers and target groups that you are responsible for monitoring. It also reduces chances of making configuration changes to a wrong load balancer or target group not owned by your group. For example, if you have tagged your development stage load balancers as Stage: Dev and production stage load balancers as Stage: Prod, you can filter on tag Stage: Prod to view only the production stage load balancers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Tag based filtering is available today in all AWS regions. To learn more about tagging, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-tags.html" target="_blank">Tags for Your Application Load Balancer</a>.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Feb 7, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Beginning today, you have more options to securely connect your devices to AWS IoT Core. You can use MQTT with certificate based client authentication on port 443. Previously this combination of protocol and authentication mechanism was only supported on port 8883.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Corporate firewalls and home routers often block inbound and outbound traffic on all ports except port 443 by default, which is the standard port for HTTPS (i.e. internet) traffic. This is done as a security measure to limit the attack surface for possible cyber attacks. With this update, we enable you to deploy your IoT devices with minimal network and firewall changes, while still using certificate based authentication. This is especially beneficial for those who need to deploy devices into environments where they do not control the IT infrastructure.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> As a result of this update, the following port/protocol/authentication combinations are now supported by AWS IoT Core:<br /> </p>

<p>Beginning today, you can use the Amazon Route 53 Auto Naming APIs to create CNAME records when you register instances of your microservices, and your microservices can discover the CNAMEs by querying DNS for the service name. Additionally, you can use the Amazon Route 53 Auto Naming APIs to create Route 53 alias records that route traffic to Amazon Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now you can register your service instances using Amazon Route 53 Auto Naming APIs and specify settings for A, AAAA, CNAME, and SRV records, and for Route 53 alias records that route traffic to an ELB load balancer. To learn more about Amazon Route 53 Auto Naming, please see our <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/overview-service-discovery.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/">product page</a>.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Feb 6, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>We are excited to announce the new ListShards API which makes it easier for your Kinesis Data Streams KCL applications to scale. Many Kinesis Data Streams customers use the KCL to process records from their data streams. Starting in <a href="https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Camazon-kinesis-client">version 1.9.0 or later</a>, key KCL API functions now use the ListShards API, which supports a 10x higher call rate limit compared to the DescribeStream API, which was used for these functions in earlier KCL versions.<br /> </p> 
<p>To benefit from this additional API call rate limit, you will need to upgrade your <a href="https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Camazon-kinesis-client">KCL applications to version 1.9.0</a> or higher and use AWS SDK version 1.11.272 or higher.</p>
