<p>Today we’re excited to announce the general availability of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/Elastic-GPUs/">Amazon EC2 Elastic GPUs</a> for Windows. An Elastic GPU is a GPU resource that you can attach to your <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" title="">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</a> instance to accelerate the graphics performance of your applications. Elastic GPUs come in medium (1GB), large (2GB), xlarge (4GB), and 2xlarge (8GB) sizes and are lower cost alternatives to using GPU instance types like G3 or G2 (for OpenGL 3.3 applications). You can use Elastic GPUs with many instance types allowing you the flexibility to choose the right compute, memory, and storage balance for your application. Today you can provision elastic GPUs in <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span> and <span title="">US East (Ohio)</span>.</p>
<p>Elastic GPUs start at just $0.05 per hour for an <strong>eg1.medium</strong>. A nickel an hour. If we attach that Elastic GPU to a <strong>t2.medium</strong> ($0.065/hour) we pay a total of less than 12 cents per hour for an instance with a GPU. Previously, the cheapest graphical workstation (G2/3 class) cost 76 cents per hour. That’s over an 80% reduction in the price for running certain graphical workloads.</p>
<h3>When should I use Elastic GPUs?</h3>
<p>Elastic GPUs are best suited for applications that require a small or intermittent amount of additional GPU power for graphics acceleration and support OpenGL. Elastic GPUs support up to and including the OpenGL 3.3 API standards with expanded API support coming soon.</p>
<p>Elastic GPUs are not part of the hardware of your instance. Instead they’re attached through an elastic GPU network interface in your subnet which is created when you launch an instance with an Elastic GPU. The image below shows how Elastic GPUs are attached.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20718" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/08/29/elastic-gpu-diagram.png" alt="" width="907" height="805" /></p>
<p>Since Elastic GPUs are network attached it’s important to provision an instance with adequate network bandwidth to support your application. It’s also important to make sure your instance security group allows traffic on port 2007.</p>
<p>Any application that can use the OpenGL APIs can take advantage of Elastic GPUs so Blender, Google Earth, SIEMENS SolidEdge, and more could all run with Elastic GPUs. Even Kerbal Space Program!</p>
<p>Ok, now that we know when to use Elastic GPUs and how they work, let’s launch an instance and use one.</p>
<h3>Using Elastic GPUs</h3>
<p>First, we’ll navigate to the EC2 console and click Launch Instance. Next we’ll select a Windows AMI like: “Microsoft Windows Server 2016 Base”. Then we’ll select an instance type. Then we’ll make sure we select the “Elastic GPU” section and allocate an eg1.medium (1GB) Elastic GPU.</p>
<p>We’ll also include some userdata in the advanced details section. We’ll write a quick PowerShell script to download and install our Elastic GPU software.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-powershell">
Start-Transcript -Path &quot;C:\egpu_install.log&quot; -Append
(new-object net.webclient).DownloadFile('http://ec2-elasticgpus.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest', 'C:\egpu.msi')
Start-Process &quot;msiexec.exe&quot; -Wait -ArgumentList &quot;/i C:\egpu.msi /qn /L*v C:\egpu_msi_install.log&quot;
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;Path&quot;, $env:Path + &quot;;C:\Program Files\Amazon\EC2ElasticGPUs\manager\&quot;, [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
Restart-Computer -Force
</code></pre>
<p>This software sends all OpenGL API calls to the attached Elastic GPU.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll double check to make sure my security group has TCP port 2007 exposed to my VPC so my Elastic GPU can connect to my instance. Finally, we’ll click launch and wait for my instance and Elastic GPU to provision. The best way to do this is to create a separate SG that you can attach to the instance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20763" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/08/29/Screenshot-2017-08-29-16.20.42.png" alt="" width="1024" height="545" /></p>
<p>You can see an animation of the launch procedure below.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20719" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/08/29/2017-08-29-00.59.55.gif" alt="" width="1498" height="834" /></p>
<p>Alternatively we could have launched on the AWS CLI with a quick call like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$aws ec2 run-instances --elastic-gpu-specification Type=eg1.2xlarge \
--image-id ami-1a2b3c4d \
--subnet subnet-11223344 \
--instance-type r4.large \
--security-groups &quot;default&quot; &quot;elasticgpu-sg&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>then we could have followed the Elastic GPU software installation instructions <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/elastic-gpus.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>We can now see our Elastic GPU is humming along and attached by checking out the Elastic GPU status in the taskbar.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20720" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/08/29/Screenshot-2017-08-29-02.29.54.png" alt="" width="1024" height="684" /></p>
<p>We welcome any feedback on the service and you can click on the Feedback link in the bottom left corner of the GPU Status Box to let us know about your experience with Elastic GPUs.</p>
<h3>Elastic GPU Demonstration</h3>
<p>Ok, so we have our instance provisioned and our Elastic GPU attached. My teammates here at AWS wanted me to talk about the amazingly wonderful 3D applications you can run, but when I learned about Elastic GPUs the first thing that came to mind was <a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/">Kerbal Space Program</a> (KSP), so I’m going to run a quick test with that. After all, if you can’t launch Jebediah Kerman into space then what was the point of all of that software? I’ve downloaded KSP and added the launch parameter of <code>-force-opengl</code> to make sure we’re using OpenGL to do our rendering. Below you can see my poor attempt at building a spaceship – I used to build better ones. It looks pretty smooth considering we’re going over a network with a lossy remote desktop protocol.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20732" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/08/29/screenshot.png" alt="" width="1023" height="602" /></p>
<p>I’d show a picture of the rocket launch but I didn’t even make it off the ground before I experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly of the rocket. Back to the drawing board for me.</p>
<p>In the mean time I can check my <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" title="">Amazon CloudWatch</a> metrics and see how much GPU memory I used during my brief game.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20739" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/08/29/Screenshot-2017-08-29-13.53.28.png" alt="" width="1024" height="555" /></p>
<h3>Partners, Pricing, and Documentation</h3>
<p>To continue to build out great experiences for our customers, our 3D software partners like ANSYS and Siemens are looking to take advantage of the OpenGL APIs on Elastic GPUs, and are currently certifying Elastic GPUs for their software. You can learn more about our partnerships <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/Elastic-GPUs/partners/">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can find information on Elastic GPU pricing <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/elastic-gpus/pricing/">here</a>. You can find additional documentation <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/elastic-gpus.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now, if you’ll excuse me I have some virtual rockets to build.</p>

<p>Last year I told you about the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-vmware-cloud-on-aws/">work that we are doing with our friends at VMware</a> to build the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/vmware">VMware Cloud on AWS</a>. As I shared at the time, this is a native, fully-managed offering that runs the VMware SDDC stack directly on bare-metal AWS infrastructure that maintains the elasticity and security customers have come to expect. This allows you to benefit from the scalability and resiliency of AWS, along with the networking and system-level hardware features that are fundamental parts of our security-first architecture.</p>
<p>VMware Cloud on AWS allows you take advantage of what you already know and own. Your existing skills, your investment in training, your operational practices, and your investment in software licenses remain relevant and applicable when you move to the public cloud. As part of that move you can forget about building &amp; running data centers, modernizing hardware, and scaling to meet transient or short-term demand. You can also take advantage of a long list of AWS compute, database, analytics, IoT, AI, security, mobile, deployment and application services.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Initial Availability</strong></span><br />
After incorporating feedback from many customers and partners in our Early Access beta program, today at <a href="https://www.vmworld.com/en/index.html">VMworld</a>, VMware and Amazon announced the initial availability of VMware Cloud on AWS. This service is initially available in the <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span> region through VMware and members of the <a href="http://cloud.vmware.com/vmc-aws/partners">VMware Partner Network</a>. It is designed to support popular use cases such as data center extension, application development &amp; testing, and application migration.</p>
<p>This offering is sold, delivered, supported, and billed by VMware. It supports custom-sized VMs, runs any OS that is supported by VMware, and makes use of single-tenant bare-metal AWS infrastructure so that you can bring your Windows Server licenses to the cloud. Each SDDC (Software-Defined Data Center) consists of 4 to 16 instances, each with 36 cores, 512 GB of memory, and 15.2 TB of NVMe storage. Clusters currently run in a single AWS <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html">Availability Zone</a> (AZ) with support in the works for clusters that span AZs. You can spin up an entire VMware SDDC in a couple of hours, and scale host capacity up and down in minutes.</p>
<p>The NSX networking platform (powered by the AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/elastic-network-adapter-high-performance-network-interface-for-amazon-ec2/">Elastic Networking Adapter</a> running at up to 25 Gbps) supports multicast traffic, separate networks for management and compute, and IPSec VPN tunnels to on-premises firewalls, routers, and so forth.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview to show you how all of the parts fit together:</p>
<p><img class="size-medium aligncenter" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/vmware_aws_wide_slide_2.png" width="890" height="401" /></p>
<p>The VMware and third-party management tools (<a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/vcenter-server.html">vCenter Server</a>, <a href="https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/PowerCLI/">PowerCLI</a>, the <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-suite.html">vRealize Suite</a>, and code that calls the <a href="https://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/sdk_pubs.html">vSphere API</a>) that you use today will work just fine when you build a hybrid VMware environment that combines your existing on-premises resources and those that you launch in AWS. This hybrid environment will use a new VMware Hybrid Linked Mode to create a single, unified view of your on-premises and cloud resources. You can use familiar VMware tools to manage your applications, without having to purchase any new or custom hardware, rewrite applications, or modify your operating model.</p>
<p>Your applications and your code can access the full range of AWS services (the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/">database</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/products/analytics/">analytical</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/">AI</a> services are a good place to start). Use for these services is billed separately and you’ll need to <a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html">create an AWS account</a>.</p>

Our teams have come a long way since last year, but things are just getting revved up!</p>
<p>VMware and AWS are continuing to invest to enable support for new capabilities and use cases, such as application migration, data center expansion, and application test and development. Work is under way to add additional AWS regions, support more use cases such as disaster recovery and data center consolidation, add certifications, and enable even deeper integration with AWS services.</p>

<p>Recently I was reading articles on <a href="http://www.forbes.com">Forbes.com</a>, as well as, some other tech-focused websites around mobile user experience, engagement, and development. Almost every article, it mentions that the success of a mobile app development project is dependent upon the delivery of a well-designed user onboarding experience and an engaging mobile interface. An <a href="https://www.inc.com/rahul-varshneya/7-reasons-why-users-delete-your-mobile-app.html">Inc.com article</a> states that over 90% of all downloaded apps used only once and then removed. &nbsp;The number 3 reason noted for users deleting mobile applications from their devices was a poor user experience and interface design. In addition, a subsequent article shares that one of the rules of mobile application engagement is to “Focus on quick wins during onboarding”.</p>
<p>Implementing a smooth mobile user experience is not easy, and I speak from experience as a developer who has built many mobile apps where each time I have struggled to build the user interface of the&nbsp;mobile application. Since identity is mission critical for applications, and it is usually the first entry point when onboarding users onto most mobile and web applications to present these capabilities in a fluid and seamless user interface. Therefore, I am exultant over <strong>AWS Cognito User Pools</strong> – <strong>App Integration and Federation </strong>and thrilled to announce the general availability of this new service feature.</p>
<p>Just in case you have not taken advantage of <strong>Amazon&nbsp;Cognito</strong> as of yet, let me introduce you to the service. <strong>Amazon Cognito</strong> is a managed cloud service that allows you to add authentication, authorization, and user management to your web, mobile and even IoT applications<strong>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon Cognito </strong>features consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amazon Cognito User Pools: </strong>create and maintain a user directory in order to add sign-up and sign-in to your mobile app or web application. You can also sign in users to a user pool through social identity providers as well as, SAML-based providers</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Cognito Federated Identities: </strong>enables the creation of unique identities for users and the ability to authenticate them with federated identity providers, such as Google or Facebook, for temporary, limited-privilege access to app resources</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Cognito Sync: </strong>allows you to synchronize user profile data across mobile devices and the web without the need to build a backend. It supports offline access, cross-device synchronizing, and local data caching of application-related user data so the user app experience remains consistent regardless of the device.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the General Availability of <strong>Amazon Cognito User Pools</strong> – <strong>App Integration and Federation, </strong>we are now adding AWS-hosted user sign-up and sign-in UI pages to help web and mobile app developers effortlessly integrate and customize the onboarding user experience for their applications. In addition, when using the Cognito User pools user directory, you can enhance your mobile client login capabilities by providing a sign-up and sign-in for social identity providers including Facebook, Google, <a href="https://login.amazon.com/">Login with Amazon</a>, as well as through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML">SAML</a> with corporate identity providers such as Microsoft Active Directory.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-01-Header-sm.png" width="1070" height="512" /></p>
<p>The aspects of the <strong>Amazon Cognito User Pools – App Integration and Federation</strong> service features provided in this GA release are as follows:</p>

<p>Since I can’t wait to try out these new features, let’s build a quick app using the new Cognito User Pool App Integration and Federation features. Therefore, off&nbsp;to the <a href="http://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito">Cognito management console</a> we go. Once in the console, I’ll quickly create a User Pool for our test by clicking the <strong>Manage your User Pools</strong> button.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-02-CognitoConsole.png" width="1000" height="547" /><br />
Once in the User Pools console, I’ll click the <strong>Create a user pool</strong> button. Once in the Create a user pool screen, I’ll name my new user pool, <strong>TaraCognitoGAPool, </strong>and since I want to customize my hosted UI and take advantage of the other new features, I opt for creating my pool by selecting the <strong>Step Through the Settings</strong> button to complete the creation of my user pool.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-03-MyUserPools.png" width="1000" height="241" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-04-CreateUserPool.png" width="1000" height="419" /><br />
On the <strong>Attributes</strong> tab, I have two sign-in options for my users; they can sign in via <strong>Username</strong> and I can additionally grant the user multiple alternatives of how to log into my application. The other option is to allow the user to make use of their <strong>Email address or phone number</strong> to sign in and I can provide them the ability to use both options or ensure only one of the aforementioned methods are used. Usually, I opt for the user to use Username with email, but since we are testing out the new features of App Integration and Federation today, I am going to select <strong>Email address or phone number </strong>and only allow the use of email addresses for sign-in/sign-up.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-05-CreateUserPool-attributes.png" width="1000" height="457" /></p>
<p>Next stop is the <strong>Policies</strong> and the <strong>Verifications</strong> tabs for which I will keep all of the default options selected on both of the tabs. On the Verification tab, however, I do want to provide the option for Cognito to send SMS messages on my behalf. Therefore, I will choose the <strong>Create Role</strong> button and allow an IAM role to be created granting SMS permissions. I complete the selection of options for my user pool options by clicking <strong>Save Changes</strong> button.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-06-CreateUserPool-policies.png" width="1000" height="493" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-07-CreateUserPool-verifications.png" width="1000" height="498" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-08-CreateUserPool-verifications-role.png" width="1000" height="463" /></p>
<p>The last step is to go to the <strong>App clients tab</strong> and create an app client by clicking the <strong>Add an app client </strong>link on the page. I’ll name my app client, <strong>TaraCognitoGA-App</strong>, leave all the default options the same, and click the <strong>Create app client</strong> button.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-09-CreateUserPool-CreateAppClient.png" width="1000" height="289" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-10-CreateUserPool-AppClientOption.png" width="1000" height="533" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-11-AppClientUserPoolAccess.png" width="1000" height="338" /><br />
All that is left is to review the <strong>TaraCognitoGAPool</strong> options and click <strong>Create</strong> <strong>pool</strong> button.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-12-UserPoolCreation.png" width="1000" height="481" /><br />
Great! Now that my user pool, <strong>TaraCognitoGAPool</strong> has been created. I can take advantage of the new <strong>App Integration and Federation</strong> features.&nbsp; If you have created a user pool before, you will notice that the user pool screen now contains tabs for the new user pools features in the menu side bar.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-13-UserPoolConfirmation.png" width="1000" height="500" /></p>
<p>This is what we’ve been waiting for. Now I will go into <strong>App integration</strong> tab in order to configure settings to have my own customized, built-in UI for signing up and signing in users to my <strong>TaraCognitoGA-App</strong>.</p>
<p>First I’ll go into my <strong>App client settings</strong> under the <strong>App Integration tab</strong>. Here I will enable the identity providers I want to allow users of my application to use when signing in. Since I have only enabled <strong>Cognito User Pools</strong> as an identity provider, it is currently the only identity provider option. If I want to allow users to sign in with external identity providers like Facebook or a SAML provider I will have to configure them with Federation. We’ll discuss this shortly.</p>
<p>For now, I’ll &nbsp;enter the callback URL that my app should go to once the user has been successful in logging in, and the URL that the app should return to once the user has logged out. I’ve created a quick S3 website to use with my Cognito new sign-in. For more information on these options please see: &nbsp;<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-app-idp-settings.html#cognito-user-pools-app-idp-settings-about">Specifying Identity Provider Settings for Your User Pool App</a> in the Cognito developer guide.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-14-AppClientSettings.png" width="1000" height="487" /><br />
Now I’ll to go to the <strong>Domain name</strong> option under the <strong>App Integration</strong> tab, and I’ll enter a domain prefix to be used for my sign-up and sign-in pages hosted by Cognito. Keeping with my current naming convention, I’ll name my domain, <strong>taracognitodomain-ga</strong>, and click the <strong>Check Availability</strong> button. Remember your domain name must be unique across the chosen AWS region and can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. Since my domain name is available, I will click <strong>Save changes</strong> and go to <strong>UI customization settings</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-15-DomainName.png" width="1000" height="365" /><br />
<strong>UI customization</strong> settings is where I can change the look and feel of the default AWS UI hosted sign-in for a specific app client or as the default look for all my app clients. I’ll select the app client I created earlier and upload my personal logo to be displayed on my page. You should note that you can customize the CSS for several fields and HTML tags for your page as well by selecting the options under the <strong>CSS customizations (optional)</strong> section and adding your CSS as desired.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-16-UICustomization.png" width="1000" height="766" /></p>
<p>After selecting the <strong>Save Changes</strong> button, I can now view my login page, which I can use for by web and mobile app clients. The hosted UI for your Cognito User Pool can be accessed by using a URL with the following pattern:</p>
<p>Which would make my hosted URL as following <em>(my client id&nbsp;is obfuscated)</em>:</p>
<p>Clicking on this link displays my custom sign-in and sign-up page hosted by AWS Cognito User Pools with my custom logo presented. How exciting!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-17-HostedUISignin.png" width="1000" height="562" /></p>
<p>We’re cooking with gas! But wait, I promised that I would discuss how to tie Federation and external federated identity providers to your Cognito User Pool. I’m sure you thought that I had forgotten. No worries, I’ll discuss Federation now.</p>
<p>Configuring Federation with a social and/or a SAML identity provider is pretty easy. With Cognito’s built-in integrations, you no longer have to integrate multiple identity provider SDKs or handle redirects or post backs in your app. Cognito handles the identity provider interactions for you and creates user profiles for federated users in Cognito User Pools.</p>
<p>However, before I show you how to configure a Cognito Federated identity provider, I actually need one to show. Given this, I ran over to the<strong> Login with Amazon</strong> page and created an app so I can use it as one of my federated identity providers. Sure, I could have done Facebook or Google but everyone does those identity providers, and hey, we all need a little variety in our lives.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-18-LoginWAmazon.png" width="1000" height="463" /><br />
With my <strong>Login with Amazon</strong> app id and app secret in hand, I’ll return to the Cognito User Pool console and go to the Federation tab on the menu side bar. I’ll select the identity providers option, and here I am presented with all the identity providers supported for sign in with Cognito User Pools. Here I will select the <strong>Login with Amazon</strong> identity provider.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-19-FederationIDs.png" width="1000" height="393" /><br />
Now I will enter my app ID/client ID and app secret provided by the Login with Amazon service into the <strong>Amazon app ID</strong> and <strong>App secret</strong> fields. I also can determine what scopes and related data are authorized by this login. For this sample, I have chosen to enter profile, postal_code, and email in the <strong>Authorize scope</strong> field.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-20-AddLoginWAmazonID.png" width="1000" height="529" /></p>
<p>All that is left is for me to select the <strong>Enable Login with Amazon</strong> button, and I have successfully added the identity provider for the Login with Amazon identity service.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-21-IDConfirmation.png" width="1000" height="369" /><br />
My final step is to go to the <strong>Attribute mapping</strong> section also under the Federation section. Here I will select the <strong>Amazon</strong> tab and map the <strong>Login with Amazon</strong> attributes to the attributes captured by Cognito User Pool. Once I hit that <strong>Save</strong> <strong>changes</strong> button, I have successfully added the <strong>Login with Amazon</strong> identity provider.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-22-AttributeMapping.png" width="1000" height="528" /></p>
<p>If I go back to <strong>App client settings </strong>and enable <strong>Login with Amazon</strong> provider by checking the provider related check box, and return to my Cognito UI hosted login page; I now see that Cognito has successfully added the <strong>Login with Amazon</strong> to my sign in page.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Cognito GA-23-HostedUIwIDLogin.png" width="1000" height="538" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Summary </u></strong></p>
<p>Fantastic! Now as a developer, I can focus on making my app experience as smooth and engaging as possible, including a simple, customized sign in process for my app users without the heavy lifting typically needed to implement a sign in screen with social and SAML identity providers.</p>
<p><strong>AWS Cognito User Pools</strong> – <strong>App Integration and Federation </strong>enables web and mobile app developers to easily integrate and customize a user experience for users to sign-up and sign-in though AWS-hosted web pages. Additionally, it simplifies user management by providing a unified user authentication and authorization mechanism whether using Cognito User Pools as a user directory and/or other identity providers including Facebook, Google, Login with Amazon, as well as, corporate SAML providers like Microsoft Active Directory.&nbsp; Learn more about this great service by checking out the Amazon Cognito <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cognito">product page</a> or the Amazon Cognito <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/">developer guide</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>We (the AWS Blog Team) work to maintain a delicate balance between coverage and volume! On the one hand, we want to make sure that you are aware of as many features as possible. On the other, we don’t want to bury you in blog posts. As a happy medium between these two extremes we sometimes let interesting new features pile up for a couple of weeks and then pull them together in the form of a recap post such as this one.</p>
<p>Today I would like to tell you about the latest and greatest additions to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/appstream2/">Amazon AppStream 2.0</a>, our application streaming service (read <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-appstream-2-0-stream-desktop-apps-from-aws/">Amazon AppStream 2.0 – Stream Desktop Apps from AWS</a> to learn more). We launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-gpu-powered-streaming-instances-for-amazon-appstream-2-0/">GPU-powered streaming instances</a> just a month ago and have been <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-appstream-2-0-features-fleet-auto-scaling-image-builder-saml-metrics-and-fleet-management/">adding features rapidly</a>; here are some recent launches that did not get covered in individual posts at launch time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft Active Directory Domains </strong>– Connect AppStream 2.0 streaming instances to your Microsoft Active Directory domain.</li>
<li><strong>User Management &amp; Web Portal – </strong>Create and manage users from within the AppStream 2.0 management console.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent Storage for User Files</strong> – Use persistent, S3-backed storage for user home folders.</li>
<li><strong>Simple Network Setup</strong> – Enable Internet access for image builder and instance fleets more easily.</li>
<li><strong>Custom VPC Security Groups</strong> – Use VPC security groups to control network traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Audio-In</strong> – Use microphones with your streaming applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>These features were prioritized based on early feedback from AWS customers who are using or are considering the use of AppStream 2.0 in their enterprises. Let’s take a quick look at each one.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Domain Join</strong></span><br />
This much-requested feature allows you to connect your AppStream 2.0 streaming instances to your Microsoft Active Directory (AD) domain. After you do this you can apply existing policies to your streaming instances, and provide your users with single sign-on access to intranet resources such as web sites, printers, and file shares. Your users are authenticated using the SAML 2.0 provider of your choice, and can access applications that require a connection to your AD domain.</p>
<p>To get started, visit the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/home?/stacks">AppStream 2.0 Console</a>, create and store a Directory Configuration:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/as_wu_create_directory_config_1.png" width="866" height="453" /></p>
<p>Newly created image builders and newly launched fleets can then use the stored Directory Configuration to join the AD domain in an Organizational Unit (OU) that you provide:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/as_pick_dir_not_nose_1.png" width="873" height="401" /></p>
<p>To learn more, read <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/active-directory.html">Using Active Directory Domains with AppStream 2.0</a> and follow the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/active-directory-directory-setup.html">Setting Up the Active Directory</a> tutorial. You can also learn more in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/07/amazon-appstream-2-0-now-supports-microsoft-active-directory-domains/">What’s New</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>User Management &amp; Web Portal</strong></span><br />
This feature makes it easier for you to give new users access to the applications that you are streaming with AppStream 2.0 if you are not using the Domain Join feature that I described earlier.</p>
<p>You can create and manage users, give them access to applications through a web portal, and send them welcome emails, all with a couple of clicks:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/as_create_user_1.png" width="810" height="422" /></p>
<p>AppStream 2.0 sends each new user a welcome email that directs them to a web portal where they will be prompted to create a permanent password. Once they are logged in they are able to access the applications that have been assigned to them.</p>
<p>To learn more, read <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/user-pool.html">Using the AppStream 2.0 User Pool</a> and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/06/amazon-appstream-2-0-introduces-built-in-user-management-and-web-portals-for-users/">What’s New</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Persistent Storage</strong></span><br />
This feature allows users of streaming applications to store files for use in later AppStream 2.0 sessions. Each user is given a home folder which is stored in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a> between sessions. The folder is made available to the streaming instance at the start of the session and changed files are periodically synced back to S3. To enable this feature, simply check Enable Home Folders when you create your next fleet:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/as_enable_home_store_1.png" width="887" height="334" /></p>
<p>All folders (and the files within) are stored in an S3 bucket that is automatically created within your account when the feature is enabled. There is no limit on total file storage but we recommend that individual files be limited to 5 gigabytes.</p>
<p>Regular <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">S3 pricing</a> applies; to learn more about this feature read about <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/home-folders.html">Persistent Storage with AppStream 2.0 Home Folders</a> and check out the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/05/amazon-appstream-2-0-now-offers-persistent-storage-for-end-users-files-backed-by-amazon-s3/">What’s New</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Simple Network Setup</strong></span><br />
Setting up Internet access for your image builder and your streaming instances was once a multi-step process. You had to create a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway in a public subnet of one of your VPCs and configure traffic routing rules.</p>
<p>Now, you can do this by marking the image builder or the fleet for Internet access, selecting a VPC that has at least one public subnet, and choosing the public subnet(s), all from the AppStream 2.0 Console:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/as_config_simple_net_1.png" width="889" height="694" /></p>
<p>To learn more, read <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/managing-network.html">Network Settings for Fleet and Image Builder Instances</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/managing-network-internet-default.html">Enabling Internet Access Using a Public Subnet</a> and check out the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/04/amazon-appstream-2-0-adds-simple-network-setup-for-internet-access/">What’s New</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Custom VPC Security Groups</strong></span><br />
You can create VPC security groups and associate them with your image builders and your fleets. This gives you fine-grained control over inbound and outbound traffic to databases, license servers, file shares, and application servers. Read the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/05/appstream-2-0-use-your-vpc-security-group-to-control-network-traffic/">What’s New</a> to learn more.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Audio-In</strong></span><br />
You can use analog and USB microphones, mixing consoles, and other audio input devices with your streaming applications. Simply click on <strong>Enable Microphone</strong> in the AppStream 2.0 toolbar to get started. Read the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/08/amazon-appstream-2-0-now-lets-you-use-microphones-with-your-streaming-applications/">What’s New</a> to learn more.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br />
All of these features are available now and you can start using them today in all AWS Regions where Amazon AppStream 2.0 is available.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffbarr">Jeff</a>;</p>
<p>PS – If you are new to AppStream 2.0, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/appstream2/trynow/">try out some pre-installed applications</a>. No setup needed and you’ll get to experience the power of streaming applications first-hand.</p>

<p>Our customers use Cost Explorer to better understand and manage their AWS spending, making heavy use of the reporting, analytics, and visualization tools that it provides. We launched Cost Explorer in 2014 with a focus on simplicity – single click signup, preconfigured default views, and a clean user interface (take a look back at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/the-new-cost-explorer-for-aws/">The New AWS Cost Explorer</a> to see where we started). The Cost Explorer has been very popular and we’ve received a lot of great feedback from our customers.</p>
<p>Last week we launched a major upgrade to Cost Explorer. We’ve redesigned the user interface to optimize many common workflows including filtering, report management, selection of date ranges, and grouping of data. We have also included some default reports to make it easier for you to explore the costs related to your use of Reserved Instances.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Looking at Cost Explorer</strong></span><br />
Since pictures are reportedly worth 1000 words, let’s take a closer look! Cost Explorer is part of the Billing Dashboard so I can start there:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/console_dash_menu_1.png" width="495" height="349" /></p>
<p>Here’s the Billing Dashboard. I click on <strong>Cost Explorer</strong> to move ahead:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ce_billing_dash_1.png" width="760" height="574" /></p>
<p>I can open up Cost Explorer or access one of three preconfigured views. I’ll go for the first option:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ce_almost_there_1.png" width="810" height="384" /></p>
<p>The default report shows my EC2 costs and usage (running hours) for the past 3 months:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ce_default_view_1.png" width="900" height="677" /></p>
<p>I can use the <strong>Group By</strong> menu to break the costs down by EC2 instance type:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ce_ec2_by_instance_type_1.png" width="890" height="542" /></p>
<p>I have many other grouping options:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ce_group_menu_1.png" width="309" height="434" /></p>
<p>The filtering options are now easier to access and to edit. Here’s the full set:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ce_all_filters_1.png" width="320" height="582" /></p>
<p>I can explore my EC2 costs in any set of desired regions:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ce_filter_region_oregon_1.png" width="290" height="487" /></p>
<p>I can filter and then group by instance type to see how my spending breaks down:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ce_ec2_type_region_1.png" width="900" height="722" /></p>
<p>I can click on <strong>Download CSV</strong> and then process the data locally:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ce_csv_data_1.png" width="890" height="196" /></p>
<p>I can also exclude certain instance types from the report. Here’s how I exclude my <strong>m4.xlarge</strong>, <strong>t2.micro</strong>, and <strong>t2.nano</strong> usage:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ce_ec2_exclude_1.png" width="890" height="654" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Report Management</strong></span><br />
Cost Explorer allows me to customize my existing reports and to create new reports from scratch. I can click on <strong>Save As</strong> to save my customized report with a new name:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ce_save_as_1.png" width="760" height="253" /></p>
<p>I can see and manage all of my reports on the Saved Reports page (The padlock denotes a default report that cannot be edited and then overwritten):</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ce_my_reports_1.png" width="900" height="486" /></p>
<p>When I click on <strong>New report</strong> I can start from a template:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ce_make_new_report_1.png" width="810" height="510" /></p>
<p>After I click on Create Report, I set up my date range and filters as desired, and click on <strong>Save As</strong>. I created a report that displays my year-to-date usage of several AWS database services (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/" title="">Amazon Redshift</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/dax/">DynamoDB Accelerator</a> (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/dax/">DAX</a>), <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" title="">Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dms/" title="">AWS Database Migration Service</a>):</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ce_create_db_report_1.png" width="830" height="630" /></p>
<p>All of my reports are accessible from the <strong>Reports</strong> menu so I can check on my costs with a click:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="border: 1px dotted black" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ce_reports_menu_1.png" width="353" height="358" /></p>
<p>We also simplified the process of selecting a range of dates for a report, including options to select common date ranges:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ce_date_picker_1.png" width="512" height="370" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Reserved Instance Reports</strong></span><br />
Cost Explorer also includes a pair of reports that will help you to understand and optimize your usage of Reserved Instances. I don’t own an RI’s so I used screen shots supplied by the team.</p>
<p>The RI Utilization report allows you to see how much of your purchased RI capacity is being put to use (the dashed red line represents a utilization target that you can specify):</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ri_util_1.png" width="810" height="318" /></p>
<p>The RI Coverage report tells you how much of your EC2 usage is being handled by Reserved Instances (this time, the dashed red line represents the desired amount of coverage):</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ri_coverage_1.png" width="810" height="317" /></p>
<p>I hope you have enjoyed this tour of the updated Cost Explorer. It is available now and you can start using it today!</p>

<p>I’ve been earning a living in the technology industry since 1977, when I worked in one of the first computer stores in the country as a teenager. Looking back over the past 40 years, and realizing that the <a href="http://www.livingcomputers.org/Discover/At-The-Museum/VintageComputers.aspx">Altair, IMSAI, Sol-20, and North Star Horizon</a> machines that I learned about, built, debugged, programmed, sold, and supported can now be seen in museums (Seattle’s own <a href="http://www.livingcomputers.org/">Living Computer Museum</a> is one of the best), helps me to appreciate that the world I live in changes quickly, and to understand that I need to do the same. This applies to technology, to people, and to attitudes.</p>
<p>I lived in a suburb of Boston in my early teens. At that time, diversity meant that one person in my public school had come all the way from (gasp) England a few years earlier. When I went to college I began to meet people from other countries and continents and to appreciate the fresh vantage points and approaches that they brought to the workplace and to the problems that we tackled together.</p>
<p>Back in those days, there were virtually no women working as software engineers, managers, or entrepreneurs. Although the computer store was owned by a couple and the wife did all of the management, this was the exception rather than the rule at that time, and for too many years after that. Today, I am happy to be part of a team that brings together the most capable people, regardless of their gender, race, background, or anything other than their ability to do a kick-ass job (<a href="https://twitter.com/acvisneski?lang=en">Ana</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/taraw">Tara</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jrhunt">Randall</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tinathebarr">Tina</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devin-watson-819a57a1/">Devin</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sara-rodas-44210984/">Sara</a>, I’m talking about all of you).</p>
<p>We want to do all that we can to encourage young women to prepare to become the next generation of engineers, managers, and entrepreneurs. AWS is proud to support <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a> (including the <a title="undefined" href="https://girlswhocode.com/summer-immersion-programs/" target="null">Summer Immersion Program</a>), <a href="http://girlsintech.org/">Girls in Tech</a>, and other organizations supporting women and underrepresented communities in tech. I sincerely believe that these organizations will be able to move the needle in the right direction. However, like any large-scale social change, this is going to take some time with results visible in years and decades, and only with support &amp; participation from those of us already in the industry.</p>
<p><img style="float: right;border: 1px solid black;margin-left: 8px" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/aws_booth_git_1.jpg" />In conjunction with <a href="http://me-and-eve.com/">me&amp;Eve</a>, we were able to speak with some of the attendees at the most recent <a href="https://girlsintech.org/programs/catalyst-conference/">Girls in Tech Catalyst conference</a> (that’s our booth in the picture). Click through to see what the attendees had to say:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BXwVHLul2P1"><strong>Aaron Levie</strong></a> – Co-founder and CEO, Box.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m happy to be part of an organization that supports such a worthwhile cause, and that challenges us to make our organization ever-more diverse. While reviewing this post with my colleagues I learned about <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/we-power-tech/">We Power Tech</a>, an AWS program designed to build skills and foster community and to provide access to Amazon executives who are qualified to speak about the program and about diversity. In conjunction with our friends at Accenture, we have assembled a strong <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/learn/diversity/">Diversity at re:Invent</a> program.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago on the blog, I <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-the-aws-chatbot-challenge-create-conversational-intelligent-chatbots-using-amazon-lex-and-aws-lambda/">announced the<strong> AWS Chatbot Challenge</strong></a> in conjunction with <strong><a href="http://slack.com/">Slack</a></strong>. The <strong>AWS Chatbot Challenge</strong> was an opportunity to build a unique chatbot that helped to solve a problem or that would add value for its prospective users. The mission was to build a conversational, natural language chatbot using <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/lex">Amazon Lex</a> and leverage Lex’s integration with <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/lambda">AWS Lambda</a> to execute logic or data processing on the backend.</p>
<p>I know that you all have been anxiously waiting to hear announcements of who were the winners of the AWS Chatbot Challenge as much as I was. Well wait no longer, the winners of the AWS Chatbot Challenge have been decided.</p>

<p style="font-size: 120%"><strong><u>Diving into the Winning Chatbot Projects<img class="alignright size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Chatbot Winners-02-AWSChatbots-sm.png" width="400" height="141" /></u></strong></p>
<p>Let’s take a walkthrough of the details for each of the winning projects to get a view of what made these chatbots&nbsp;distinctive, as well as, learn more about the technologies used to implement the chatbot solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 110%;color: #3366ff"><strong>BuildFax Counts by Joe Emison </strong></span></p>
<p>The <strong>BuildFax Counts</strong> bot was created as a real solution for the BuildFax company to decrease the amount the time that sales and marketing teams can get answers on permits or properties with permits meet certain criteria.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Chatbot Winners-03-BuildFaxCountsBot.png" width="1000" height="570" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.buildfax.com/"><strong>BuildFax</strong></a>, a company co-founded by bot developer Joe Emison, has the only national database of building permits, which updates data from approximately half of the United States on a monthly basis. In order to accommodate the many requests that come in from the sales and marketing team regarding permit information, BuildFax has a technical sales support team that fulfills these requests sent to a ticketing system by manually writing SQL queries that run across the shards of the BuildFax databases. Since there are a large number of requests received by the internal sales support team and due to the manual nature of setting up the queries, it may take several days for getting the sales and marketing teams to receive an answer.</p>
<p>The <strong>BuildFax Counts</strong> chatbot solves this problem by taking the permit inquiry that would normally be sent into a ticket from the sales and marketing team, as input from Slack to the chatbot. Once the inquiry is submitted into Slack, a query executes and the inquiry results are returned immediately.</p>
<p>Joe built this solution by first creating a nightly export of the data in their BuildFax MySQL RDS database to CSV files that are stored in <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a>. From the exported CSV files, an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/athena">Amazon Athena</a> table was created in order to run quick and efficient queries on the data. He then used Amazon Lex to create a bot to handle the common questions and criteria that may be asked by the sales and marketing teams when seeking data from the BuildFax database by modeling the language used from the BuildFax ticketing system. He added several different sample utterances and slot types; both custom and Lex provided, in order to correctly parse every question and criteria combination that could be received from an inquiry.&nbsp; Using Lambda, Joe created a Javascript Lambda function that receives information from the Lex intent and used it to build a SQL statement that runs against the aforementioned Athena database using the<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-node-js/"> AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js</a> library to return inquiry count result and SQL statement used.</p>
<p>The <strong>BuildFax Counts</strong> bot is used today for the BuildFax sales and marketing team to get back data on inquiries immediately that previously took up to a week to receive results.</p>
<p>Not only is <strong>BuildFax Counts</strong> bot our 1st place winner and wonderful solution, but its creator, Joe Emison, is a great guy. &nbsp;Joe has opted to donate his prize; the $5,000 cash, the $2,500 in AWS Credits, and one re:Invent ticket to the <a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/">Black Girls Code</a> organization. I must say, you rock Joe for helping these kids get access and exposure to technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 110%;color: #3366ff"><strong>Hubsy by Andrew Riess,&nbsp;Andrew Puch, and John Wetzel</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Hubsy</strong> bot was created to redefine and personalize the way users traditionally manage their HubSpot account. <strong><a href="https://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a></strong> is a SaaS system providing marketing, sales, and CRM software. <strong>Hubsy</strong> allows users of HubSpot to create engagements and log engagements with customers, provide sales teams with deals status, and retrieves client contact information quickly. Hubsy uses Amazon Lex’s conversational interface to execute commands from the HubSpot API so that users can gain insights, store and retrieve data, and manage tasks directly from <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://slack.com/">Slack</a>, or <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit">Alexa</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Chatbot Winners-04-HubsyBot.png" width="1116" height="505" /></p>
<p>In order to implement the <strong>Hubsy</strong> chatbot, Andrew and the team members used AWS Lambda to create a Lambda function with Node.js to parse the users request and call the HubSpot API, which will fulfill the initial request or return back to the user asking for more information. <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> was used to automatically setup and update Lambda, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">CloudWatch</a> logs, as well as, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam">IAM</a> profiles. Amazon Lex was used to build the conversational piece of the bot, which creates the utterances that a person on a sales team would likely say when seeking information from HubSpot. To integrate with Alexa, the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit">Amazon Alexa skill builder</a> was used to create an Alexa skill which was tested on an Echo Dot. Cloudwatch Logs are used to log the Lambda function information to CloudWatch in order to debug different parts of the Lex intents. In order to validate the code before the Terraform deployment, <a href="http://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> was additionally used to ensure the code was linted and proper development standards were followed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 110%;color: #3366ff"><strong>PFMBot by Benny Leong and his team from MoneyLion</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>PFMBot</strong>, Personal Finance Management Bot, &nbsp;is a bot to be used with the <strong><a href="https://www.moneylion.com/">MoneyLion</a> </strong>finance group which offers customers online financial products; loans, credit monitoring, and free credit score service to improve the financial health of their customers. Once a user signs up an account on the MoneyLion app or website, the user has the option to link their bank accounts with the MoneyLion APIs. Once the bank account is linked to the APIs, the user will be able to login to their MoneyLion account and start having a conversation with the <strong>PFMBot</strong> based on their bank account information.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Chatbot Winners-05-MoneyLion-sm.png" width="700" height="661" /></p>
<p>The <strong>PFMBot</strong> UI has a web interface built with using Javascript integration. The chatbot was created using Amazon Lex to build utterances based on the possible inquiries about the user’s MoneyLion bank account. <strong>PFMBot</strong> uses the Lex built-in AMAZON slots and parsed and converted the values from the built-in slots to pass to AWS Lambda. The AWS Lambda functions interacting with Amazon Lex are Java-based Lambda functions which call&nbsp;the MoneyLion Java-based internal APIs running on <a href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a>. These APIs obtain account data and related bank account information from the MoneyLion MySQL Database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 110%;color: #3366ff"><strong>ADP Payroll Innovation Bot&nbsp;by Eric Liu, Jiaxing Yan, and Fan Yang</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>ADP PI (Payroll Innovation) bot</strong> is designed to help employees of <strong><a href="https://www.adp.com/">ADP</a></strong> customers easily review their own payroll details and compare different payroll data by just asking the bot for results. The <strong>ADP PI </strong>Bot additionally offers issue reporting functionality for employees to report payroll issues and aids HR managers in quickly receiving and organizing any reported payroll issues.</p>
<p>The <strong>ADP Payroll Innovation</strong> bot is an ecosystem for the ADP payroll consisting of two chatbots, which includes <strong>ADP PI</strong> Bot for external clients (employees and HR managers), and <strong>ADP&nbsp;PI DevOps </strong>Bot for internal ADP DevOps team.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Chatbot Winners-06-PIBot.png" width="1000" height="640" /><br />
The architecture for the <strong>ADP</strong>&nbsp;<strong>PI DevOps</strong> bot is different architecture from the <strong>ADP</strong>&nbsp;<strong>PI</strong> bot shown above as it is deployed internally to ADP. The <strong>ADP&nbsp;PI DevOps</strong> bot allows input from both Slack and Alexa. When input comes into Slack, Slack sends the request to Lex for it to process the utterance. Lex then calls the Lambda backend, which obtains ADP data sitting in the ADP VPC running within an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">Amazon VPC</a>. When input comes in from Alexa, a Lambda function is called that also obtains data from the ADP VPC running on AWS.</p>
<p>The architecture for the <strong>ADP PI</strong> bot consists of users entering in requests and/or entering issues via Slack. When requests/issues are entered via Slack, the Slack APIs communicate via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">Amazon API Gateway</a> to AWS Lambda. The Lambda function either writes data into one of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a> databases for recording issues and/or sending issues or it sends the request to Lex. When sending issues, DynamoDB integrates with <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> to keep HR Managers abreast of the escalated issues. Once the request data is sent from Lambda to Lex, Lex processes the utterance and calls another Lambda function that integrates with the ADP API and it calls ADP data from within the ADP VPC, which runs on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> were the chosen languages for the development of the bots.</p>
<p>The <strong>ADP PI</strong>&nbsp;bot ecosystem has the following functional groupings:</p>
<p><strong>Employee Functionality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Summarize Payrolls</li>
<li>Compare Payrolls</li>
<li>Escalate Issues</li>
<li>Evolve PI Bot</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HR Manager Functionality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bot Management</li>
<li>Audit and Feedback</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DevOps Functionality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce call volume in service centers (ADP PI Bot).</li>
<li>Track issues and generate reports (ADP PI Bot).</li>
<li>Monitor jobs for various environment (ADP PI DevOps Bot)</li>
<li>View job dashboards (ADP PI DevOps Bot)</li>
<li>Query job details (ADP PI DevOps Bot)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today we released Dedicated IP Pools for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses/" title="">Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)</a>. With dedicated IP pools, you can specify which <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/dedicated-ips.html#dedicated-ip-trade-offs">dedicated IP</a> addresses to use for sending different types of email. Dedicated IP pools let you use your SES for different tasks. For instance, you can send transactional emails from one set of IPs and you can send marketing emails from another set of IPs.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Amazon SES these concepts may not make much sense. We haven’t had the chance to cover SES on this blog since 2016, which is a shame, so I want to take a few steps back and talk about the service as a whole and some of the enhancements the team has made over the past year. If you just want the details on this new feature I strongly recommend reading the <a href="https://sesblog.amazon.com/" title="">Amazon Simple Email Service Blog</a>.</p>
<h3>What is SES?</h3>
<p>So, what is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses/" title="">SES</a>? If you’re a customer of Amazon.com you know that we send a lot of emails. Bought something? You get an email. Order shipped? You get an email. Over time, as both email volumes and types increased Amazon.com needed to build an email platform that was flexible, scalable, reliable, and cost-effective. SES is the result of years of Amazon’s own work in dealing with email and maximizing deliverability.</p>
<p>In short: SES gives you the ability to send and receive many types of email with the monitoring and tools to ensure high deliverability.</p>
<p>Sending an email is easy; one simple API call:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">import boto3
ses = boto3.client('ses')
ses.send_email(
Source='randhunt@amazon.com',
Destination={'ToAddresses': ['randhunt@amazon.com']},
Message={
'Subject': {'Data': 'Hello, World!'},
'Body': {'Text': {'Data': 'Hello, World!'}}
}
)</code></pre>
<p>Receiving and reacting to emails is easy too. You can set up rulesets that forward received emails to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns/" title="">Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)</a>, or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> – you could even trigger a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lex" title="">Amazon Lex</a> bot through Lambda to communicate with your customers over email. SES is a powerful tool for building applications. The image below shows just a fraction of the capabilities:</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/08/18/2017-08-17-22.07.20.gif" alt="" width="1115" height="728" class="aligncenter size-full" /></p>
<h3>Deliverability 101</h3>
<p>Deliverability is the percentage of your emails that arrive in your recipients’ inboxes. Maintaining deliverability is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. AWS takes the fight against spam very seriously and works hard to make sure services aren’t abused. To learn more about deliverability I recommend the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/deliverability-and-ses.html" target="_blank">deliverability docs</a>. For now, understand that deliverability is an important aspect of email campaigns and SES has many tools that enable a customer to manage their deliverability.</p>
<h3>Dedicated IPs and Dedicated IP pools</h3>
<p>When you’re starting out with SES your emails are sent through a shared IP. That IP is responsible for sending mail on behalf of many customers and AWS works to maintain appropriate volume and deliverability on each of those IPs. However, when you reach a sufficient volume shared IPs may not be the right solution.</p>
<p>By creating a dedicated IP you’re able to fully control the reputations of those IPs. This makes it vastly easier to troubleshoot any deliverability or reputation issues. It’s also useful for many email certification programs which require a dedicated IP as a commitment to maintaining your email reputation. Using the shared IPs of the Amazon SES service is still the right move for many customers but if you have sustained daily sending volume greater than hundreds of thousands of emails per day you might want to consider a dedicated IP. One caveat to be aware of: if you’re not sending a sufficient volume of email with a consistent pattern a dedicated IP can actually hurt your reputation. Dedicated IPs are $24.95 per address per month at the time of this writing – but you can find out more at the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses/pricing/">pricing page</a>.</p>
<p>Before you can use a Dedicated IP you need to “warm” it. You do this by gradually increasing the volume of emails you send through a new address. Each IP needs time to build a positive reputation. In March of this year SES released the ability to automatically warm your IPs over the course of 45 days. This feature is on by default for all new dedicated IPs.</p>
<p>Customers who send high volumes of email will typically have multiple dedicated IPs. Today the SES team released dedicated IP pools to make managing those IPs easier. Now when you send email you can specify a configuration set which will route your email to an IP in a pool based on the pool’s association with that configuration set.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/08/18/DIP-multi-pools1.png" alt="" width="1372" height="963" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20603" /></p>
<p>One of the other major benefits of this feature is that it allows customers who previously split their email sending across several AWS accounts (to manage their reputation for different types of email) to consolidate into a single account.</p>
<p>You can read the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/dedicated-ip-pools.html">documentation</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ses/announcing-dedicated-ip-pools/">blog</a> for more info.</p>

<p>Starting today <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/" title="">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a> (VPC) Endpoints for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" title="">Amazon DynamoDB</a> are available in all public AWS regions. You can provision an endpoint right away using the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a> or the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>. There are no additional costs for a VPC Endpoint for DynamoDB.</p>
<p>Many AWS customers run their applications within a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/" title="">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a> (VPC) for security or isolation reasons. Previously, if you wanted your EC2 instances in your VPC to be able to access DynamoDB, you had two options. You could use an Internet Gateway (with a NAT Gateway or assigning your instances public IPs) or you could route all of your traffic to your local infrastructure via VPN or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/" title="">AWS Direct Connect</a> and then back to DynamoDB. Both of these solutions had security and throughput implications and it could be difficult to configure NACLs or security groups to restrict access to just DynamoDB. Here is a picture of the old infrastructure.<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20514" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/08/15/ddb-no-vpc-endpoint-1024x561.png" alt="" width="640" height="351" /></p>
<h3>Creating an Endpoint</h3>
<p>Let’s create a VPC Endpoint for DynamoDB. We can make sure our region supports the endpoint with the <a title="undefined" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeVpcEndpointServices.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DescribeVpcEndpointServices</a> API call.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">
<b>aws ec2 describe-vpc-endpoint-services --region us-east-1</b>
{
&quot;ServiceNames&quot;: [
&quot;com.amazonaws.us-east-1.dynamodb&quot;,
&quot;com.amazonaws.us-east-1.s3&quot;
]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Great, so I know my region supports these endpoints and I know what my regional endpoint is. I can grab one of my VPCs and provision an endpoint with a quick call to the CLI or through the console. Let me show you how to use the console.</p>
<p>First I’ll navigate to the VPC console and select “Endpoints” in the sidebar. From there I’ll click “Create Endpoint” which brings me to this handy console.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20546" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/08/16/Screenshot-2017-08-15-16.04.07-1024x986.png" alt="" width="640" height="616" /></p>
<p>You’ll notice the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/" title="">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> policy section for the endpoint. This supports all of the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/specifying-conditions.html">fine grained access control</a> that DynamoDB supports in regular IAM policies and you can restrict access based on IAM policy conditions.</p>
<p>For now I’ll give full access to my instances within this VPC and click “Next Step”.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20547" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/08/16/Screenshot-2017-08-15-16.07.08-1024x717.png" alt="" width="640" height="448" /></p>
<p>This brings me to a list of route tables in my VPC and asks me which of these route tables I want to assign my endpoint to. I’ll select one of them and click “Create Endpoint”.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the note of warning in the console: if you have source restrictions to DynamoDB based on public IP addresses the source IP of your instances accessing DynamoDB will now be their private IP addresses.</p>
<p>After adding the VPC Endpoint for DynamoDB to our VPC our infrastructure looks like this.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20515" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/08/15/ddb-yes-vpc-endpoint-1024x565.png" alt="" width="640" height="353" /></p>
<p>That’s it folks! It’s that easy. It’s provided at no cost. Go ahead and start using it today. If you need more details you can read the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/vpc-endpoints-dynamodb.html">docs here</a>.</p>
