<p>Late last year I told you about our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-aurora-update-postgresql-compatibility/">plans</a> to add PostgreSQL compatibility to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/" title="">Amazon Aurora</a>. We launched the private beta shortly after that announcement, and followed it up earlier this year with an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/sign-up-today-preview-of-amazon-aurora-with-postgresql-compatibility/">open preview</a>. We’ve received lots of great feedback during the beta and the preview and have done our best to make sure that the product meets your needs and exceeds your expectations!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Now Generally Available</strong></span><br /> I am happy to report that Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL Compatibility is now generally available and that you can use it today in four AWS Regions, with more to follow. It is compatible with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/release-9-6-3.html">PostgreSQL 9.6.3</a> and scales automatically to support up to 64 TB of storage, with 6-way replication behind the scenes to improve performance and availability.</p> 
<p>Just like Amazon Aurora with MySQL compatibility, this edition is fully managed and is very easy to set up and to use. On the performance side, you can expect up to 3x the throughput that you’d get if you ran PostgreSQL on your own (you can read <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/p1041-verbitski.pdf">Amazon Aurora: Design Considerations for High Throughput Cloud-Native Relational Databases</a> to learn more about how we did this).</p> 
<p>You can launch a PostgreSQL-compatible Amazon Aurora instance from the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home">RDS Console</a> by selecting Amazon Aurora as the engine and PostgreSQL-compatible as the edition, and clicking on <strong>Next</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_console_launch_page1_3.png" width="688" height="635" /></p> 
<p>Then choose your instance class, single or Multi-AZ deployment (good for dev/test and production, respectively), set the instance name, and the administrator credentials, and click on <strong>Next</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_console_launch_page2_2.png" width="775" height="535" /></p> 
<p>You can choose between six instance classes (2 to 64 vCPUs and 15.25 to 488 GiB of memory):</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_console_instance_types_menu_2.png" width="286" height="162" /></p> 
<p>The <strong>db.r4</strong> instance class is new addition to Aurora and to RDS, and gives you an additional size at the top-end. The <strong>db.r4.16xlarge</strong> will give you additional write performance, and may allow you to use a single Aurora database instead of two or more sharded databases.</p> 
<p>You can also set many advanced options on the next page, starting with network options such as the VPC and public accessibility:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_adv_net_3.png" width="770" height="357" /></p> 
<p>You can set the cluster name and other database options. Encryption is easy to use and enabled by default; you can use the built-in default master key or choose one of your own:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_adv_db_3.png" width="900" height="482" /></p> 
<p>You can also set failover behavior, the retention period for snapshot backups, and choose to enable collection of detailed (OS-level) metrics via Enhanced Monitoring:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_adv_fbr_2.png" width="895" height="593" /></p> 
<p>After you have set it up to your liking, click on <strong>Launch DB Instance</strong> to proceed!</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_takeoff_2.png" width="661" height="600" /></p> 
<p>The new instances (primary and secondary since I specified Multi-AZ) are up and running within minutes:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_running_3.png" /></p> 
<p>Each PostgreSQL-compatible instance publishes 44 metrics to CloudWatch automatically:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_metrics_std_2.png" width="810" height="922" /></p> 
<p>With enhanced monitoring enabled, each instance collects additional per-instance and per-process metrics. It can be enabled when the instance is launched, or afterward, via <strong>Modify Instance</strong>. Here are some of the metrics collected when enhanced monitoring is enabled:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_enh_metrics_2.png" width="810" height="629" /></p> 
<p>Clicking on Manage Graphs lets you choose which metrics are shown:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_pick_em_1.png" width="830" height="715" /></p> 
<p>Per-process metrics are also available:</p>

<p>You can scale your read capacity by creating up to 15 Aurora replicas:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_create_rr_2.png" width="288" height="527" /></p> 
<p>The cluster provides a single reader endpoint that you can access in order to load-balance requests across the replicas:</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Performance Insights</strong></span><br /> As I noted earlier, Performance Insights is turned on automatically. This Amazon Aurora feature is wired directly into the database engine and allows you to look deep inside of each query, seeing the database resources that it uses and how they contribute to the overall response time. Here’s the initial view:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_pi_load_2.png" /></p> 
<p>I can slice the view by SQL query in order to see how many concurrent copies of each query are running:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_pi_load_by_query_2.png" /></p> 
<p>There are more views and options than I can fit in this post; to learn more take a look at <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.html">Using Performance Insights</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Migrating to Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL Compatibility</strong></span><br /> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dms/" title="">AWS Database Migration Service</a> and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dms/#sct" title="">Schema Conversion Tool</a> are ready to help you to move data stored in commercial and open-source databases to Amazon Aurora.

<p>You have long had the ability to tag your AWS resources and to see cost breakouts on a per-tag basis. Cost allocation was launched in 2012 (see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-cost-allocation/">AWS Cost Allocation for Customer Bills</a>) and we have steadily added support for additional services, most recently DynamoDB (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/announcing-tagging-for-amazon-dynamodb/">Introducing Cost Allocation Tags for Amazon DynamoDB</a>), Lambda (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/04/aws-lambda-supports-tagging-and-cost-allocations/">AWS Lambda Supports Tagging and Cost Allocations</a>), and EBS (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-cost-allocation-for-ebs-snapshots/">New – Cost Allocation for AWS Snapshots</a>).</p> 
<p>Today, we are launching tag-based cost allocation for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" title="">Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)</a>. You can now assign tags to your queues and use them to manage your costs at any desired level: application, application stage (for a loosely coupled application that communicates via queues), project, department, or developer. After you have tagged your queues, you can use the AWS Tag Editor to search queues that have tags of interest.</p> 
<p>Here’s how I would add three tags (<strong>app</strong>, <strong>stage</strong>, and <strong>department</strong>) to one of my queues:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/sqs_tag_queue_1.png" width="860" height="521" /></p> 
<p>This feature is available now in all AWS Regions and you can start using in today! To learn more about tagging, read <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-queue-tags.html">Tagging Your Amazon SQS Queues</a>. To learn more about cost allocation via tags, read <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html">Using Cost Allocation Tags</a>. To learn more about how to use message queues to build loosely coupled microservices for modern applications, read our blog post (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-loosely-coupled-scalable-c-applications-with-amazon-sqs-and-amazon-sns/">Building Loosely Coupled, Scalable, C# Applications with Amazon SQS and Amazon SNS</a>) and watch the recording of our recent webinar, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UesxWuZMZqI">Decouple and Scale Applications Using Amazon SQS and Amazon SNS</a>.</p> 
<p>If you are coming to <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a>, plan to attend session <a href="https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=17553">ARC 330: How the BBC Built a Massive Media Pipeline Using Microservices</a>. In the talk you will find out how they used SNS and SQS to improve the elasticity and reliability of the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer">BBC iPlayer</a> architecture.</p>

<p>With just 40 days remaining before <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a> begins, my colleagues and I want to share some tips that will help you to make the most of your time in Las Vegas. As always, our focus is on training and education, mixed in with some after-hours fun and recreation for balance.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Locations, Locations, Locations</strong></span><br /> The <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/campus/">re:Invent Campus</a> will span the length of the Las Vegas strip, with events taking place at the MGM Grand, Aria, Mirage, Venetian, Palazzo, the Sands Expo Hall, the Linq Lot, and the Encore. Each venue will host tracks devoted to specific topics:</p> 
<p><a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/campus/"><img style="float: right;margin-left: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/reinvent_2017_strip_map_1.png" /></a><strong>MGM Grand</strong> – Business Apps, Enterprise, Security, Compliance, Identity, Windows.</p> 
<p><strong>Aria</strong> – Analytics &amp; Big Data, Alexa, Container, IoT, AI &amp; Machine Learning, and Serverless.</p> 
<p><strong>Mirage</strong> – Bootcamps, Certifications &amp; Certification Exams.</p> 
<p><strong>Venetian / Palazzo / Sands Expo Hall</strong> – Architecture, AWS Marketplace &amp; Service Catalog, Compute, Content Delivery, Database, DevOps, Mobile, Networking, and Storage.</p> 
<p><strong>Linq Lot</strong> – Alexa Hackathons, Gameday, Jam Sessions, re:Play Party, Speaker Meet &amp; Greets.</p> 
<p><strong>Encore</strong> – <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/info/bookable-meeting-space/">Bookable meeting space</a>.</p> 
<p>If your interests span more than one topic, plan to take advantage of the re:Invent shuttles that will be making the rounds between the venues.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Lots of Content</strong></span><br /> The <a href="https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/search.ww">re:Invent Session Catalog</a> is now live and you should start to choose the sessions of interest to you now.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/search.ww"><img style="float: right;margin-left: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/reinvent_2017_session_catalog_1.png" /></a>With more than 1100 sessions on the agenda, planning is essential! Some of the most popular “deep dive” sessions will be run more than once and others will be streamed to overflow rooms at other venues. We’ve analyzed a lot of data, run some simulations, and are doing our best to provide you with multiple opportunities to build an action-packed schedule.</p> 
<p>We’re just about ready to let you reserve seats for your sessions (follow <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffbarr">me</a> and/or <a href="https://twitter.com/awscloud">@awscloud</a> on Twitter for a heads-up). Based on feedback from earlier years, we have fine-tuned our seat reservation model. This year, 75% of the seats for each session will be reserved and the other 25% are for walk-up attendees. We’ll start to admit walk-in attendees 10 minutes before the start of the session.</p> 
<p>Las Vegas never sleeps and neither should you! This year we have a host of late-night sessions, workshops, chalk talks, and hands-on labs to keep you busy after dark.</p> 
<p>To learn more about our plans for sessions and content, watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIngAvWk0gY">Get Ready for re:Invent 2017 Content Overview</a> video.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Have Fun</strong></span><br /> After you’ve had enough training and learning for the day, plan to attend the <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/pubcrawl/">Pub Crawl</a>, the <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/replay/">re:Play party</a>, the <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/tatonka-challenge/">Tatonka Challenge</a> (two locations this year), our <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/hands-on-lego/">Hands-On LEGO Activities</a>, and the <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/harley-ride">Harley Ride</a>. Stay fit with our <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/run/">4K Run</a>, <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/spinning-challenge/">Spinning Challenge</a>, <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/bootcamp/">Fitness Bootcamps</a>, and <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/broomball/">Broomball</a> (a longstanding Amazon tradition).</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>See You in Vegas</strong></span><br /> As always, I am looking forward to meeting as many AWS users and blog readers as possible. Never hesitate to stop me and to say hello!</p>

<p>Starting today, you can connect to your Amazon Elasticsearch Service domains from within an Amazon VPC without the need for NAT instances or Internet gateways. VPC support for Amazon ES is easy to configure, reliable, and offers an extra layer of security. With VPC support, traffic between other services and Amazon ES stays entirely within the AWS network, isolated from the public Internet. You can manage network access using existing VPC security groups, and you can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for additional protection. VPC support for Amazon ES domains is available at no additional charge.</p> 
<h3>Getting Started</h3> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21238" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/10/16/2017-10-16-10.43.19.gif" alt="" width="1310" height="688" /></p> 
<p>Creating an Amazon Elasticsearch Service domain in your VPC is easy. Follow all the steps you would normally follow to create your cluster and then select “VPC access”.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21241" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/10/16/Screenshot-2017-10-16-15.46.23.png" alt="" width="1280" height="505" /></p> 
<p>That’s it. There are no additional steps. You can now access your domain from within your VPC!</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21244" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/10/16/Screenshot-2017-10-16-18.56.42.png" alt="" width="1822" height="806" /></p> 
<h3>Things To Know</h3> 
<p>To support VPCs, Amazon ES places an endpoint into at least one subnet of your VPC. Amazon ES places an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) into the VPC for each data node in the cluster. Each ENI uses a private IP address from the IPv4 range of your subnet and receives a public DNS hostname. If you enable zone awareness, Amazon ES creates endpoints in two subnets in different availability zones, which provides greater data durability.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21266" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/10/17/2az_arch.png" alt="" width="1158" height="900" /></p> 
<p>You need to set aside three times the number of IP addresses as the number of nodes in your cluster. You can divide that number by two if Zone Awareness is enabled. Ideally, you would create separate subnets just for Amazon ES.</p> 
<p>A few notes:</p> 
<li>Currently, you cannot move existing domains to a VPC or vice-versa. To take advantage of VPC support, you must create a new domain and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-managedomains-snapshots.html">migrate your data</a>.</li> 
<li>Currently, Amazon ES does not support Amazon Kinesis Firehose integration for domains inside a VPC.</li> 
<p>To learn more, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-vpc.html">Amazon ES documentation</a>.</p>

<p>I first told you about <a href="https://amazonlightsail.com" title="">Amazon Lightsail</a> last year in my blog post, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-lightsail-the-power-of-aws-the-simplicity-of-a-vps/">Amazon Lightsail – the Power of AWS, the Simplicity of a VPS</a>. Since last year’s launch, thousands of customers have used Lightsail to get started with AWS, launching Linux-based Virtual Private Servers.</p> 
<p>Today we are adding support for Windows-based Virtual Private Servers. You can launch a VPS that runs Windows Server 2012 R2, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/windows-server">Windows Server 2016</a>, or Windows Server 2016 with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express">SQL Server 2016 Express</a> and be up and running in minutes. You can use your VPS to build, test, and deploy .NET or Windows applications without having to set up or run any infrastructure. Backups, DNS management, and operational metrics are all accessible with a click or two.</p> 
<p>Servers are available in five sizes, with 512 MB to 8 GB of RAM, 1 or 2 vCPUs, and up to 80 GB of SSD storage. Prices (including software licenses) start at $10 per month:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ls_win_plans_1.png" width="814" height="314" /></p> 
<p>You can try out a 512 MB server for one month (up to 750 hours) at no charge.</p>

<p><strong>Post by <a href="https://twitter.com/mza">Dr. Matt Wood</a></strong></p> 
<p>Today, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS </a>and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/blog/2017/10/microsoft-aws-advance-open-ai-ecosystem-gluon-partnership/">Microsoft</a> announced <a href="http://www.github.com/gluon-api/gluon-api/">Gluon</a>, a new open source deep learning interface which allows developers to more easily and quickly build machine learning models, without compromising performance.</p> 
<p><img class="wp-image-21191 size-medium alignright" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/10/12/photo-1-300x234.jpg" alt="Gluon Logo" width="300" height="234" /></p> 
<p>Gluon provides a clear, concise API for defining machine learning models using a collection of pre-built, optimized neural network components. Developers who are new to machine learning will find this interface more familiar to traditional code, since machine learning models can be defined and manipulated just like any other data structure. More seasoned data scientists and researchers will value the ability to build prototypes quickly and utilize dynamic neural network graphs for entirely new model architectures, all without sacrificing training speed.</p> 
<p>Gluon is available in <a href="https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/gluon/">Apache MXNet</a> today, a forthcoming Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit release, and in more frameworks over time.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Neural Networks vs Developers<br /> </strong></span>Machine learning with neural networks (including ‘deep learning’) has three main components: data for training; a neural network model, and an algorithm which trains the neural network. You can think of the neural network in a similar way to a directed graph; it has a series of inputs (which represent the data), which connect to a series of outputs (the prediction), through a series of connected layers and weights. During training, the algorithm adjusts the weights in the network based on the error in the network output. This is the process by which the network learns; it is a memory and compute intensive process which can take days.</p> 
<p>Deep learning frameworks such as Caffe2, Cognitive Toolkit, TensorFlow, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mxnet/">Apache MXNet</a> are, in part, an answer to the question ‘how can we speed this process up? Just like query optimizers in databases, the more a training engine knows about the network and the algorithm, the more optimizations it can make to the training process (for example, it can infer what needs to be re-computed on the graph based on what else has changed, and skip the unaffected weights to speed things up). These frameworks also provide parallelization to distribute the computation process, and reduce the overall training time.</p> 
<p>However, in order to achieve these optimizations, most frameworks require the developer to do some extra work: specifically, by providing a formal definition of the network graph, up-front, and then ‘freezing’ the graph, and just adjusting the weights.</p> 
<p>The network definition, which can be large and complex with millions of connections, usually has to be constructed by hand. Not only are deep learning networks unwieldy, but they can be difficult to debug and it’s hard to re-use the code between projects.</p> 
<p>The result of this complexity can be difficult for beginners and is a time-consuming task for more experienced researchers. At AWS, we’ve been experimenting with some ideas in MXNet around new, flexible, more approachable ways to define and train neural networks. Microsoft is also a contributor to the open source MXNet project, and were interested in some of these same ideas. Based on this, we got talking, and found we had a similar vision: to use these techniques to reduce the complexity of machine learning, making it accessible to more developers.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Enter Gluon: dynamic graphs, rapid iteration, scalable training<br /> </strong></span>Gluon introduces four key innovations.</p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>Friendly API:</strong> Gluon networks can be defined using a simple, clear, concise code – this is easier for developers to learn, and much easier to understand than some of the more arcane and formal ways of defining networks and their associated weighted scoring functions.</li> 
<li><strong>Dynamic networks:</strong> the network definition in Gluon is dynamic: it can bend and flex just like any other data structure. This is in contrast to the more common, formal, symbolic definition of a network which the deep learning framework has to effectively carve into stone in order to be able to effectively optimize computation during training. Dynamic networks are easier to manage, and with Gluon, developers can easily ‘hybridize’ between these fast symbolic representations and the more friendly, dynamic ‘imperative’ definitions of the network and algorithms.</li> 
<li><strong>The algorithm can define the network:</strong> the model and the training algorithm are brought much closer together. Instead of separate definitions, the algorithm can adjust the network dynamically during definition and training. Not only does this mean that developers can use standard programming loops, and conditionals to create these networks, but researchers can now define even more sophisticated algorithms and models which were not possible before. They are all easier to create, change, and debug.</li> 
<li><strong>High performance operators for training:</strong> which makes it possible to have a friendly, concise API and dynamic graphs, without sacrificing training speed. This is a huge step forward in machine learning. Some frameworks bring a friendly API or dynamic graphs to deep learning, but these previous methods all incur a cost in terms of training speed. As with other areas of software, abstraction can slow down computation since it needs to be negotiated and interpreted at run time. Gluon can efficiently blend together a concise API with the formal definition under the hood, without the developer having to know about the specific details or to accommodate the compiler optimizations manually.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>The team here at AWS, and our collaborators at Microsoft, couldn’t be more excited to bring these improvements to developers through Gluon. We’re already seeing quite a bit of excitement from developers and researchers alike.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Getting started with Gluon<br /> </strong></span>Gluon is available today in Apache MXNet, with support coming for the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit in a future release. We’re also publishing the front-end interface and the low-level API specifications so it can be included in other frameworks in the fullness of time.</p> 
<p>You can get started with Gluon today. Fire up the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/amis/">AWS Deep Learning AMI</a> with a single click and jump into one of 50 fully worked, notebook examples. If you’re a contributor to a machine learning framework, check out the interface specs on <a href="https://github.com/gluon-api/gluon-api/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Today we’re launching support for multiple TLS/SSL certificates on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/details/#details">Application Load Balancers</a> (ALB) using Server Name Indication (SNI). You can now host multiple TLS secured applications, each with its own TLS certificate, behind a single load balancer. In order to use SNI, all you need to do is bind multiple certificates to the same secure listener on your load balancer. ALB will automatically choose the optimal TLS certificate for each client. These new features are provided at no additional charge. </p> 
<p>If you’re looking for a TL;DR on how to use this new feature just click <a href="#ALB">here</a>. If you’re like me and you’re a little rusty on the specifics of Transport Layer Security (TLS) then keep reading.</p> 
<h3>TLS? SSL? SNI?</h3> 
<p>People tend to use the terms SSL and TLS interchangeably even though the two are technically different. SSL technically refers to a predecessor of the TLS protocol. To keep things simple I’ll be using the term TLS for the rest of this post.</p> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-21109 alignright" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/10/09/https.png" alt="" width="236" height="272" /></p> 
<p>TLS is a protocol for securely transmitting data like passwords, cookies, and credit card numbers. It enables privacy, authentication, and integrity of the data being transmitted. TLS uses certificate based authentication where certificates are like ID cards for your websites. You trust the person that signed and issued the certificate, the certificate authority (CA), so you trust that the data in the certificate is correct. When a browser connects to your TLS-enabled ALB, ALB presents a certificate that contains your site’s public key, which has been cryptographically signed by a CA. This way the client can be sure it’s getting the ‘real you’ and that it’s safe to use your site’s public key to establish a secure connection.</p> 
<p>With SNI support we’re making it easy to use more than one certificate with the same ALB. The most common reason you might want to use multiple certificates is to handle different domains with the same load balancer. It’s always been possible to use wildcard and subject-alternate-name (SAN) certificates with ALB, but these come with limitations. Wildcard certificates only work for related subdomains that match a simple pattern and while SAN certificates can support many different domains, the same certificate authority has to authenticate each one. That means you have reauthenticate and reprovision your certificate everytime you add a new domain.</p> 
<p>One of our most frequent requests on forums, reddit, and in my e-mail inbox has been to use the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6066#page-6">Server Name Indication</a> (SNI) extension of TLS to choose a certificate for a client. Since TLS operates at the transport layer, below HTTP, it doesn’t see the hostname requested by a client. SNI works by having the client tell the server “This is the domain I expect to get a certificate for” when it first connects. The server can then choose the correct certificate to respond to the client. All modern web browsers and a large majority of other clients support SNI. In fact, today we see SNI supported by over 99.5% of clients connecting to CloudFront.</p> 
<h3>Smart Certificate Selection on ALB</h3> 
<p>ALB’s smart certificate selection goes beyond SNI. In addition to containing a list of valid domain names, certificates also describe the type of key exchange and cryptography that the server supports, as well as the signature algorithm (SHA2, SHA1, MD5) used to sign the certificate. To establish a TLS connection, a client starts a TLS handshake by sending a “ClientHello” message that outlines the capabilities of the client: the protocol versions, extensions, cipher suites, and compression methods. Based on what an individual client supports, ALB’s smart selection algorithm chooses a certificate for the connection and sends it to the client. ALB supports both the classic RSA algorithm and the newer, hipper, and faster Elliptic-curve based ECDSA algorithm. ECDSA support among clients isn’t as prevalent as SNI, but it is supported by all modern web browsers. Since it’s faster and requires less CPU, it can be particularly useful for ultra-low latency applications and for conserving the amount of battery used by mobile applications. Since ALB can see what each client supports from the TLS handshake, you can upload both RSA and ECDSA certificates for the same domains and ALB will automatically choose the best one for each client.</p> 
<h3 id="ALB">Using SNI with ALB</h3> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21066" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/10/05/2017-10-05-00.51.24.gif" alt="" width="827" height="569" /></p> 
<p>I’ll use a few example websites like <a href="https://VimIsBetterThanEmacs.com">VimIsBetterThanEmacs.com</a> and <a href="https://VimIsTheBest.com">VimIsTheBest.com</a>. I’ve purchased and hosted these domains on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/" title="">Amazon Route 53</a>, and provisioned two separate certificates for them in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/" title="">AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)</a>. If I want to securely serve both of these sites through a single ALB, I can quickly add both certificates in the console.</p> 
<p>First, I’ll select my load balancer in the console, go to the listeners tab, and select “view/edit certificates”.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21068" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/10/05/elb1-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="523" /></p> 
<p>Next, I’ll use the “+” button in the top left corner to select some certificates then I’ll click the “Add” button.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21069" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/10/05/elb2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="552" /></p> 
<p>There are no more steps. If you’re not really a GUI kind of person you’ll be pleased to know that it’s also simple to add new certificates via the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a> (or SDKs).</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-bash">aws elbv2 add-listener-certificates --listener-arn &lt;listener-arn&gt; --certificates CertificateArn=&lt;cert-arn&gt;</code></pre> 
<h3>Things to know</h3> 
<li>ALB Access Logs now include the client’s requested hostname and the certificate ARN used. If the “hostname” field is empty (represented by a “-“) the client did not use the SNI extension in their request.</li> 
<li>You can use any of your certificates in ACM or IAM.</li> 
<li>You can bind multiple certificates for the same domain(s) to a secure listener. Your ALB will choose the optimal certificate based on <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-https-listener.html#https-listener-certificates">multiple factors</a> including the capabilities of the client.</li> 
<li>If the client does not support SNI your ALB will use the default certificate (the one you specified when you created the listener).</li> 
<li>There are three new ELB API calls: AddListenerCertificates, RemoveListenerCertificates, and DescribeListenerCertificates.</li> 
<li>You can bind up to 25 certificates per load balancer (not counting the default certificate).</li> 
<li>These new features are supported by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" title="">AWS CloudFormation</a> at launch.</li> 
<p>You can see an example of these new features in action with a set of websites created by my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/jonzobrist">Jon Zobrist</a>: <a href="https://www.exampleloadbalancer.com/">https://www.exampleloadbalancer.com/</a>.</p> 
<p>Overall, I will personally use this feature and I’m sure a ton of AWS users will benefit from it as well. I want to thank the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing" title="">Elastic Load Balancing</a> team for all their hard work in getting this into the hands of our users.</p>

The AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) are available today in all AWS Regions and run on a wide variety of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">EC2 instance types</a>, including the new <strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-ec2-instances-with-4-tb-of-memory/">x1e.32xlarge</a></strong> with 128 vCPUs and almost 4 TB of memory.</p> 
<p>You can launch these instances from the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a> or through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/" title="">AWS Marketplace</a>. Here’s what they look like in the console:</p> 
<p><img class="size-medium aligncenter" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/sql_2017_amis_1.png" width="810" height="657" /></p> 
<p>And in AWS Marketplace:</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Licensing Options Galore</strong></span><br /> You have lots of licensing options for SQL Server:</p> 
<p><strong>Pay As You Go</strong> – This option works well if you would prefer to avoid buying licenses, are already running an older version of SQL Server, and want to upgrade. You don’t have to deal with true-ups, software compliance audits, or Software Assurance and you don’t need to make a long-term purchase. If you are running the Standard Edition of SQL Server, you also benefit from our recent <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-price-reduction-sql-server-standard-edition-on-ec2/">price reduction</a>, with savings of up to 52%.</p> 
<p><strong>License Mobility</strong> – This option lets your use your active Software Assurance agreement to bring your existing licenses to EC2, and allows you to run SQL Server on Windows or Linux instances.</p> 
<p><strong>Bring Your Own Licenses</strong> – This option lets you take advantage of your existing license investment while minimizing upgrade costs. You can run SQL Server on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/dedicated-instances/">EC2 Dedicated Instances</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/dedicated-hosts/">EC2 Dedicated Hosts</a>, with the potential to reduce operating costs by licensing SQL Server on a per-core basis. This option allows you to run SQL Server 2017 on EC2 Linux instances (SUSE, RHEL, and Ubuntu are supported) and also supports Docker-based environments running on EC2 Windows and Linux instances. To learn more about these options, read the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup">Installation Guidance for SQL Server on Linux</a> and <a title="undefined" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker" target="null">Run SQL Server 2017 Container Image with Docker</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Learn More</strong></span><br /> To learn more about SQL Server 2017 and to explore your licensing options in depth, take a look at the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/windows/products/sql/">SQL Server on AWS</a> page.</p>

<p>I often give presentations on Amazon’s culture of innovation, and start out with a slide that features a revealing quote from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ebc_jeff_bezos_invention_quote_1.png" width="800" height="452" /></p> 
<p>I love to sit down with our customers and to learn how we have empowered their creativity and to pursue their dreams. Earlier this year I chatted with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wpatrickbrandt/">Patrick Brandt</a> from The <a href="http://www.coca-colacompany.com/">Coca-Cola Company</a> in order to learn how they used <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions" title="">AWS Step Functions</a> and other AWS services to support the <a href="https://us.coca-cola.com/">Coke.com</a> Vending Pass program. This program includes drink rewards earned by purchasing products at vending machines equipped to support mobile payments using the <a href="https://us.coca-cola.com/vending/">Coca-Cola Vending Pass</a>. Participants swipe their NFC-enabled phones to complete an <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> or <a href="https://www.android.com/pay/">Android Pay</a> purchase, identifying themselves to the vending machine and earning credit towards future free vending purchases in the process</p> 
<p>After the swipe, a combination of SNS topics and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> functions initiated a pair of calls to some existing backend code to count the vending points and update the participant’s record. Unfortunately, the backend code was slow to react and had some timing dependencies, leading to missing updates that had the potential to confuse Vending Pass participants. The initial solution to this issue was very simple: modify the Lambda code to include a 90 second delay between the two calls. This solved the problem, but ate up process time for no good reason (billing for the use of Lambda functions is based on the duration of the request, in 100 ms intervals).</p> 
<p>In order to make their solution more cost-effective, the team turned to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions" title="">AWS Step Functions</a>, building a very simple state machine. As I wrote in an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-step-functions-build-distributed-applications-using-visual-workflows/">earlier blog post</a>, Step Functions coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices at scale, using visual workflows that are easy to build.</p> 
<p>Coke built a very simple state machine to simplify their business logic and reduce their costs. Yours can be equally simple, or they can make use of other Step Function features such as sequential and parallel execution and the ability to make decisions and choose alternate states. The Coke state machine looks like this:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/coke_step_delay_1.png" width="434" height="371" /></p> 
<p>The <strong>FirstState</strong> and the <strong>SecondState</strong> states (<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-task-state.html">Task</a> states) call the appropriate Lambda functions while Step Functions implements the 90 second delay (a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-wait-state.html">Wait</a> state). This modification simplified their logic and reduced their costs. Here’s how it all fits together:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/coke_vending_step_3.png" width="667" height="1005" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>What’s Next</strong></span><br /> This initial success led them to take a closer look at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/">serverless</a> computing and to consider using it for other projects. Patrick told me that they have already seen a boost in productivity and developer happiness. Developers no longer need to wait for servers to be provisioned, and can now (as Jeff says) unleash their creativity and pursue their dreams. They expect to use Step Functions to improve the scalability, functionality, and reliability of their applications, going far beyond the initial use for the Coca-Cola Vending Pass. For example, Coke has built a serverless solution for publishing nutrition information to their food service partners using Lambda, Step Functions, and API Gateway.</p> 
<p>Patrick and his team are now experimenting with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai">machine learning and artificial intelligence</a>. They built a prototype application to analyze a stream of photos from Instagram and extract trends in tastes and flavors. The application (built as a quick, one-day prototype) made use of <span title="">Lambda</span>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" title="">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/apigateway" title="">Amazon API Gateway</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/" title="">Amazon Rekognition</a> and was, in Patrick’s words, a “big win and an enabler.”</p> 
<p>In order to build serverless applications even more quickly, the development team has created an internal CI/CD reference architecture that builds on the <a href="https://serverless.com/">Serverless Application Framework</a>. The architecture includes a guided tour of Serverless and some boilerplate code to access internal services and assets. Patrick told me that this model allows them to easily scale promising projects from “a guy with a computer” to an entire development team.</p> 
<p>Patrick will be on stage at <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a> next to my colleague <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a>. To meet them in person, be sure to attend <a href="https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=14207">SRV306 – State Machines in the Wild!
