<p>At <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a> 2017, Werner encouraged his audience to “<a href="https://youtu.be/nFKVzEAm-ts?t=47m54s">Dance like nobody is watching, and to encrypt like everyone is:</a>”</p> 
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/nFKVzEAm-ts?t=47m54s"><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/werner_reinvent_dance_encrypt_1.png" /></a></p> 
<p>The AWS team is always eager to add features that make it easier for you to protect your sensitive data and to help you to achieve your compliance objectives. For example, in 2017 we launched encryption at rest for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-server-side-encryption-for-amazon-simple-queue-service-sqs/">SQS</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-encryption-at-rest-for-amazon-elastic-file-system-efs/">EFS</a>, additional <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-s3-encryption-security-features/">encryption options for S3</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-server-side-encryption-for-amazon-kinesis-streams/">server-side encryption of Kinesis Data Streams</a>.</p> 
<p>Today we are giving you another data protection option with the introduction of encryption at rest for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" title="">Amazon DynamoDB</a>. You simply enable encryption when you create a new table and DynamoDB takes care of the rest. Your data (tables, local secondary indexes, and global secondary indexes) will be encrypted using AES-256 and a service-default <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/" title="">AWS Key Management Service (KMS)</a> key. The encryption adds no storage overhead and is completely transparent; you can insert, query, scan, and delete items as before. The team did not observe any changes in latency after enabling encryption and running several different workloads on an encrypted DynamoDB table.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Creating an Encrypted Table</strong></span><br /> You can create an encrypted table from the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>, API (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTable.html"><code>CreateTable</code></a>), or CLI (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/dynamodb/create-table.html"><code>create-table</code></a>). I’ll use the console! I enter the name and set up the primary key as usual:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/dear_create_table_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Before proceeding, I uncheck <strong>Use default settings, </strong>scroll down to the <strong>Encrypytion</strong> section, and check <strong>Enable encryption</strong>. Then I click <strong>Create</strong> and my table is created in encrypted form:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/dear_please_encrypyt_it_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I can see the encryption setting for the table at a glance:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/dear_my_table_2.png" /></p> 
<p>When my compliance team asks me to show them how DynamoDB uses the key to encrypt the data, I can create a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/" title="">AWS CloudTrail</a> trail, insert an item, and then scan the table to see the calls to the AWS KMS API. Here’s an extract from the trail:</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> This feature is available now in the <span title="">US East (N. Virginia)</span>, <span title="">US East (Ohio)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, and <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span> Regions and you can start using it today.</p> 
<p>There’s no charge for the encryption; you will be charged for the calls that DynamoDB makes to AWS KMS on your behalf.</p>

<p>I first told you about <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/polly" title="">Polly</a> in late 2016 in my post <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/polly-text-to-speech-in-47-voices-and-24-languages/">Amazon Polly – Text to Speech in 47 Voices and 24 Languages</a>. After that <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a> launch, we added support for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-polly-adds-9-aws-regions-korean-language-support-and-a-new-indian-english-voice/">Korean</a>, five new voices, and made Polly available in all Regions in the <strong>aws</strong> partition. We also added <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-polly-speech-marks/">whispering</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-polly-speech-marks/">speech marks</a>, a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/amazon-polly-releases-new-timbre-effect/">timbre effect</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/09/amazon-polly-adds-dynamic-range-compression-drc-tag/">dynamic range compression</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New WordPress Plugin</strong></span><br /> Today we are launching a <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> plugin that uses Polly to create high-quality audio versions of your blog posts. You can access the audio from within the post or in podcast form using a feature that we call Amazon Pollycast! Both options make your content more accessible and can help you to reach a wider audience. This plugin was a joint effort between the AWS team our friends at AWS Advanced Technology Partner <a href="https://wpengine.com/'">WP Engine</a>.</p> 
<p>As you will see, the plugin is easy to install and configure. You can use it with installations of WordPress that you run on your own infrastructure or on AWS. Either way, you have access to all of Polly’s voices along with a wide variety of configuration options. The generated audio (an MP3 file for each post) can be stored alongside your WordPress content, or in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a>, with optional support for content distribution via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" title="">Amazon CloudFront</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Installing the Plugin</strong></span><br /> I did not have an existing WordPress-powered blog, so I begin by launching a Lightsail instance using the WordPress 4.8.1 blueprint:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ls_for_wp_polly_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I <a href="https://docs.bitnami.com/aws/faq/starting-bitnami-aws/find_credentials_lightsail/">follow these directions</a> to access my login credentials:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ls_for_wp_shell_pass_2.png" /></p> 
<p>Credentials in hand, I log in to the WordPress Dashboard:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/wp_dash_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The plugin makes calls to AWS, and needs to have credentials in order to do so. I hop over to the IAM Console and created a new policy. The policy allows the plugin to access a carefully selected set of S3 and Polly functions (find the full policy in the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-polly-wordpress-plugin/blob/master/README.txt">README</a>):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/wp_iam_polly_policy_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I create an IAM user (<strong>wp-polly-user</strong>). I enter the name and indicate that it will be used for <strong>Programmatic Access</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/wp_iam_user_create_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I attach the policy that I just created, and click on <strong>Review</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/wp_iam_user_add_polly_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I review my settings (not shown) and then click on <strong>Create User</strong>. Then I copy the two values (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) into a secure location. Possession of these keys allows the bearer to make calls to AWS so I take care not to leave them lying around.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/wp_iam_user_magic_keys_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Now I am ready to install the plugin! I go back to the WordPress Dashboard and click on <strong>Add New</strong> in the <strong>Plugins</strong> menu:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/wp_dash_pl_menu_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I click on <strong>Upload Plugin</strong> and locate the ZIP file that I downloaded from the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-polly/">WordPress Plugins</a> site. After I find it I click on <strong>Install Now</strong> to proceed:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/wp_add_plugin_upload_1.png" /></p> 
<p>WordPress uploads and installs the plugin. Now I click on <strong>Activate Plugin</strong> to move ahead:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/wp_activate_1.png" /></p> 
<p>With the plugin installed, I click on <strong>Settings</strong> to set it up:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/wp_polly_settings_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I enter my keys and click on <strong>Save Changes</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/wp_polly_keys_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The <strong>General</strong> settings let me control the sample rate, voice, player position, the default setting for new posts, and the autoplay option. I can leave all of the settings as-is to get started:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/wp_polly_settings_general_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The <strong>Cloud Storage</strong> settings let me store audio in S3 and to use CloudFront to distribute the audio:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/wp_polly_settings_storage_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The <strong>Amazon</strong> <strong>Pollycast </strong>settings give me control over the iTunes parameters that are included in the generated RSS feed:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/wp_polly_settings_pollycast_4.png" /></p> 
<p>Finally, the <strong>Bulk Update</strong> button lets me regenerate all of the audio files after I change any of the other settings:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/wp_polly_settings_add_1.png" /></p> 
<p>With the plugin installed and configured, I can create a new post. As you can see, the plugin can be enabled and customized for each post:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/wp_hello_world_editing_4.png" /></p> 
<p>I can see how much it will cost to convert to audio with a click:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/wp_hello_world_cost_3.png" /></p> 
<p>When I click on <strong>Publish</strong>, the plugin breaks the text into multiple blocks on sentence boundaries, calls the Polly <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/API_SynthesizeSpeech.html"><code>SynthesizeSpeech</code></a> API for each block, and accumulates the resulting audio in a single MP3 file. The published blog post references the file using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio"><code>&lt;audio&gt;</code></a> tag. Here’s the post:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/wp_hello_post_2.png" /></p> 
<p>I can’t seem to use an <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag in this post, but you can download and play the <a href="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/amazon_polly_12.mp3">MP3 file</a> yourself if you’d like.</p> 
<p>The Pollycast feature generates an RSS file with links to an MP3 file for each post:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/wp_pollycast_1.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Pricing</strong></span><br /> The plugin will make calls to Amazon Polly each time the post is saved or updated. Pricing is based on the number of characters in the speech requests, as described on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/polly/pricing/">Polly Pricing</a> page. Also, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" title="">AWS Free Tier</a> lets you process up to 5 million characters per month at no charge, for a period of one year that starts when you make your first call to Polly.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Going Further</strong></span><br /> The plugin is <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-polly-wordpress-plugin">available on GitHub</a> in source code form and we are looking forward to your pull requests! Here are a couple of ideas to get you started:</p> 
<p><strong>Voice Per Author</strong> – Allow selection of a distinct Polly voice for each author.</p> 
<p><strong>Quoted Text</strong> – For blogs that make frequent use of embedded quotes, use a distinct voice for the quotes.</p> 
<p><strong>Translation</strong> – Use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-translate-real-time-text-language-translation/">Amazon Translate</a> to translate the texts into another language, and then use Polly to generate audio in that language.</p> 
<p><strong>Other Blogging Engines</strong> – Build a similar plugin for your favorite blogging engine.</p> 
<p><strong>SSML Support</strong> – Figure out an interesting way to use Polly’s SSML tags to add additional character to the audio.</p> 
<p>Let me know what you come up with!</p>

<p>I recently heard my manager (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arielkelman/">Ariel Kelman</a>, VP of Marketing for AWS) talk about the important role that education plays in our work. In fact, he assigned it a significantly higher priority than traditional marketing activities that focus on leads or conversions. I’ve also heard our other leaders talk about their work to create highly scalable education programs that will allow developers, architects, and other IT professionals to improve their skills and to earn <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/">AWS Certifications</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS Developer Professional Series</strong></span><br /> Today I would like to tell you about the new <a href="https://www.edx.org/aws-developer-professional-series">AWS Developer Professional Series</a>. The AWS Training and Certification team has teamed up with <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a> to create this new three-part series. Founded by MIT and Harvard, edX is the leading non-profit online learning destination, with a global community of over 14 million learners, backed up by 130 <a href="https://www.edx.org/schools-partners">global partners</a> including universities, non-profits, and institutions. This collaboration expands our offerings, and gives you another training option!</p> 
<p>The new series is designed to help you and your colleagues to build development and DevOps skills on AWS. The courses are self-paced and build on each other in order to help you to create Python applications that run on AWS by way of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/">AWS SDK for Python</a> (also known as Boto). Here are the courses:</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/aws-developer-building-on-aws"><strong>AWS Developer: Building on AWS</strong></a> – This course will give you an introduction to AWS services and to the AWS SDKs. You’ll create and manage an AWS account, learn about Regions, AZs, and VPCs, and install SDKs. Then you will learn how to launch <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" title="">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</a> instances, set up <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> functions, and use managed services such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" title="">Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)</a>. You’ll also learn how to use our AI services for image analysis and text-to-speech, and wrap up by focusing on availability and durability.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/aws-developer-deploying-on-aws"><strong>AWS Developer: Deploying on AWS</strong></a> – This course will teach you about the concepts and practices that allow you practice DevOps on AWS. You will learn how to use developer tools like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/" title="">AWS CodeBuild</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/" title="">AWS CodeDeploy</a>, while monitoring your development and production environments using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" title="">Amazon CloudWatch</a>.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/aws-developer-optimizing-on-aws"><strong>AWS Developer: Optimizing on AWS</strong></a> – This course focuses on performance optimization and tuning of the application that you built in the predecessor courses. You will learn how to use caching and content distribution to increase performance and to improve the end-user experience for your app. You’ll also learn how to use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/" title="">AWS Key Management Service (KMS)</a> to encrypt data at rest and in transit.</p> 
<p>The courses are built with the expectation that you already have one to three years of software development experience, including some Python skills. Each course runs for six weeks and requires three to four hours of work per week on your part. Courses start in February (Building), April (Deploying), and May (Optimizing), and you can <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/aws-developer-building-on-aws">enroll now</a> at no charge. You can also pursue a Verified Certificate for a fee of $149 per course.</p>

<p>I hope that you have configured your AMIs and your current-generation EC2 instances to use the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking-ena.html">Elastic Network Adapter</a> (ENA) that I <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/elastic-network-adapter-high-performance-network-interface-for-amazon-ec2/">told you about</a> back in mid-2016. The ENA gives you high throughput and low latency, while minimizing the load on the host processor. It is designed to work well in the presence of multiple vCPUs, with intelligent packet routing backed up by multiple transmit and receive queues.</p> 
<p>Today we are opening up the floodgates and giving you access to more bandwidth in all AWS Regions. Here are the specifics (in each case, the actual bandwidth is dependent on the instance type and size):</p> 
<p><strong>EC2 to S3</strong> – Traffic to and from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a> can now take advantage of up to 25 Gbps of bandwidth. Previously, traffic of this type had access to 5 Gbps of bandwidth. This will be of benefit to applications that access large amounts of data in S3 or that make use of S3 for backup and restore.</p> 
<p><strong>EC2 to EC2</strong> – Traffic to and from EC2 instances in the same or different Availability Zones within a region can now take advantage of up to 5 Gbps of bandwidth for single-flow traffic, or 25 Gbps of bandwidth for multi-flow traffic (a flow represents a single, point-to-point network connection) by using private IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, as described <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html">here</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>EC2 to EC2 (Cluster Placement Group)</strong> – Traffic to and from EC2 instances within a cluster placement group can continue to take advantage of up to 10 Gbps of lower-latency bandwidth for single-flow traffic, or 25 Gbps of lower-latency bandwidth for multi-flow traffic.</p> 
<p>To take advantage of this additional bandwidth, make sure that you are using the latest, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html">ENA-enabled</a> AMIs on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">current-generation</a> EC2 instances. ENA-enabled AMIs are available for Amazon Linux, Ubuntu 14.04 &amp; 16.04, RHEL 7.4, SLES 12, and Windows Server (2008 R2, 2012, 2012 R2, and 2016). The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01LWSWRED/">FreeBSD AMI</a> in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/" title="">AWS Marketplace</a> is also ENA-enabled, as is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/vmware-cloud-on-aws-now-available/">VMware Cloud on AWS</a>.</p>

<p style="border: 1px dotted black;background-color: yellow;padding: 8px">Updated (March 2018) —&nbsp;For updated AWS Regions this service is available in, please read this <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/03/inter-region-vpc-peering-is-now-available-in-aws-eu-frankfurt-region/">post</a>.</p> 
<p>I’m still catching up with the last couple of <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a> launches!</p> 
<p>Today I would like to tell you about inter-region VPC peering. You have been able to create peering connections between Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in the same AWS Region since early 2014 (read <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-vpc-peering-for-the-amazon-virtual-private-cloud/">New VPC Peering for the Amazon Virtual Cloud</a> to learn more). Once established, EC2 instances in the peered VPCs can communicate with each other across the peering connection using their private IP addresses, just as if they were on the same network.</p> 
<p>At <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">re:Invent</a> we extended the peering model so that it works across AWS Regions. Like the existing model, it also works within the same AWS account or across a pair of accounts. All of the use cases that I listed in my earlier post still apply; you can centralize shared resources in an organization-wide VPC and then peer it with multiple, per-department VPCs. You can also share resources between members of a consortium, conglomerate, or joint venture.</p> 
<p>Inter-region VPC peering also allows you to take advantage of the high degree of isolation that exists between AWS Regions while building highly functional applications that span Regions. For example, you can choose geographic locations for your compute and storage resources that will help you to comply with regulatory requirements and other constraints.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Peering Details</strong></span><br /> This feature is currently enabled in the <span title="">US East (N. Virginia)</span>, <span title="">US East (Ohio)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, and <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span> Regions and for IPv4 traffic. You can connect any two VPCs in these Regions, as long as they have distinct, non-overlapping CIDR blocks. This ensures that all of the private IP addresses are unique and allows all of the resources in the pair of VPCs to address each other without the need for any form of network address translation.</p> 
<p>Connections are requested by sending an invitation from one VPC to the other and the invitation must be accepted in order to establish the connection. You can set up a peering connection using the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/vpc/">VPC APIs</a>, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>, or the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/powershell/" title="">AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell</a>.</p> 
<p>Data that passes between VPCs in distinct regions flows across the AWS global network in encrypted form. The data is encrypted in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption">AEAD</a> fashion using a modern algorithm and AWS-supplied keys that are managed and rotated automatically. The same key is used to encrypt traffic for all peering connections; this makes all traffic, regardless of customer, look the same. This anonymity provides additional protection in situations where your inter-VPC traffic is intermittent.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Setting up Inter-Region Peering</strong></span><br /> Here’s how I set up peering between two of my VPCs. I’ll start with a VPC in <span title="">US East (N. Virginia)</span> and request peering with a VPC in <span title="">US East (Ohio)</span>. I start by noting the ID (<strong>vpc-acd8ccc5</strong>) of the VPC in Ohio:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ivpc_accept_id_2.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I switch to the <span title="">US East (N. Virginia)</span> Region, click on <strong>Create Peering Connection</strong>, and choose to peer with the VPC in Ohio. I enter the Id and click on <strong>Create Peering Connection</strong> to proceed:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ivpc_create_2.png" /></p> 
<p>This creates a peering request:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ivpc_req_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I switch to the other Region and accept the pending request:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ivpc_accept_req_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Now I need to arrange to route IPv4 traffic between the two VPCs by creating route table entries in each one. I can edit the main route table or one associated with a particular VPC subnet. Here’s how I arrange to route traffic from Virginia to Ohio:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ivpc_va_to_ohio_1.png" /></p> 
<p>And here’s how I route it from Ohio to Virginia:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ivpc_ohio_to_va_1.png" /></p> 
<p>To learn more about how to do this, read <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/vpc-peering-routing.html">Updating Your Route Tables for a VPC Peering Connection</a>.</p> 
<p>The private DNS names for EC2 instances (<strong>ip-10-90-211-18.ec2.internal</strong> and the like) will not resolve across a peering connection. If you need to refer to EC2 instances and other AWS resources in other VPCs, consider creating a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-private.html">Private Hosted Zone</a> using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/" title="">Amazon Route 53</a>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ivpc_make_zone_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Unlike VPC peering within a single region, you cannot reference security groups across Inter-Region VPC Peering. Also, jumbo frames cannot be sent between regions.</p>

<p>We launched some important new EC2 instance types and features at <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a>. I’ve already told you about the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/m5-the-next-generation-of-general-purpose-ec2-instances/">M5</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-b-instances-fast-dense-storage-for-big-data-applications/">H1</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-t2-unlimited-going-beyond-the-burst-with-high-performance/">T2 Unlimited</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-bare-metal-instances-with-direct-access-to-hardware/">Bare Metal</a> instances, and about <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">Spot</a> features such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ec2-update-streamlined-access-to-spot-capacity-smooth-price-changes-instance-hibernation/">Hibernation</a> and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ec2-update-streamlined-access-to-spot-capacity-smooth-price-changes-instance-hibernation/">New Pricing Model</a>. Randall told you about the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/keeping-time-with-amazon-time-sync-service/">Amazon Time Sync Service</a>. Today I would like to tell you about two of the features that we launched: Spread placement groups and Launch Templates. Both features are available in the EC2 Console and from the EC2 APIs, and can be used in all of the AWS Regions in the “aws” partition:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ec2_menu_1.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Launch Templates</strong></span><br /> You can use launch templates to store the instance, network, security, storage, and advanced parameters that you use to launch EC2 instances, and can also include any desired tags. Each template can include any desired subset of the full collection of parameters. You can, for example, define common configuration parameters such as tags or network configurations in a template, and allow the other parameters to be specified as part of the actual launch.</p> 
<p>Templates give you the power to set up a consistent launch environment that spans instances launched in On-Demand and Spot form, as well as through EC2 Auto Scaling and as part of a Spot Fleet. You can use them to implement organization-wide standards and to enforce best practices, and you can give your IAM users the ability to launch instances via templates while withholding the ability to do so via the underlying APIs.</p> 
<p>Templates are versioned and you can use any desired version when you launch an instance. You can create templates from scratch, base them on the previous version, or copy the parameters from a running instance.</p> 
<p>Here’s how you create a launch template in the Console:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/lt_prod_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Here’s how to include network interfaces, storage volumes, tags, and security groups:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/lt_net_more_1.png" /></p> 
<p>And here’s how to specify advanced and specialized parameters:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/lt_advanced_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You don’t have to specify values for all of these parameters in your templates; enter the values that are common to multiple instances or launches and specify the rest at launch time.</p> 
<p>When you click Create launch template, the template is created and can be used to launch On-Demand instances, create Auto Scaling Groups, and create Spot Fleets:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/lt_greenery_2.png" /></p> 
<p>The <strong>Launch Instance</strong> button now gives you the option to launch from a template:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/con_li_lt_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Simply choose the template and the version, and finalize all of the launch parameters:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/lt_launch_picky_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You can also manage your templates and template versions from the Console:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/lt_action_1.png" /></p> 
<p>To learn more about this feature, read <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html">Launching an Instance from a Launch Template</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Spread Placement Groups</strong></span><br /> Spread placement groups indicate that you do not want the instances in the group to share the same underlying hardware. Applications that rely on a small number of critical instances can launch them in a spread placement group to reduce the odds that one hardware failure will impact more than one instance. Here are a couple of things to keep in mind when you use spread placement groups:</p> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em"><strong>Availability Zones</strong> – A single spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones. You can have a maximum of seven running instances per Availability Zone per group.</li> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em"><strong>Unique Hardware</strong> – Launch requests can fail if there is insufficient unique hardware available. The situation changes over time as overall usage changes and as we add additional hardware; you can retry failed requests at a later time.</li> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em"><strong>Instance Types</strong> – You can launch a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html#placement-groups-spread">wide variety</a> of M4, M5, C3, R3, R4, X1, X1e, D2, H1, I2, I3, HS1, F1, G2, G3, P2, and P3 instances types in spread placement groups.</li> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em"><strong>Reserved Instances</strong> – Instances launched into a spread placement group can make use of reserved capacity. However, you cannot currently reserve capacity for a placement group and could receive an ICE (Insufficient Capacity Error) even if you have some RI’s available.</li> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em"><strong>Applicability</strong> – You cannot use spread placement groups in conjunction with Dedicated Instances or Dedicated Hosts.</li> 
<p>You can create and use spread placement groups from the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/powershell/" title="">AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell</a>, and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/" title="">AWS SDKs</a>. The console has a new feature that will help you to learn how to use the command line:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ec2_pg_create_2.png" /></p> 
<p>You can specify an existing placement group or create a new one when you launch an EC2 instance:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ec2_pg_use_1.png" /></p> 
<p>To learn more, read about <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html">Placement Groups</a>.</p> 
<p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffbarr">Jeff</a>;</p> 
<p><strong>PS</strong> – There’s no charge for either feature.</p>

<p>I’ve been talking about scalability for servers and other cloud resources for a very long time! <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/sometimes_you_n/">Back in 2006</a>, I wrote “This is the new world of scalable, on-demand web services. Pay for what you need and use, and not a byte more.” Shortly after we launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" title="">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</a>, we made it easy for you to do this with the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-load-balancing-automatic-scaling-and-cloud-monitoring-services/">simultaneous launch</a> of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing" title="">Elastic Load Balancing</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling">EC2 Auto Scaling</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" title="">Amazon CloudWatch</a>. Since then we have added Auto Scaling to other AWS services including <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/automatic-scaling-with-amazon-ecs/">ECS</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-auto-scaling-for-ec2-spot-fleets/">Spot Fleets</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-auto-scaling-for-amazon-dynamodb/">DynamoDB</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/amazon-aurora-now-supports-auto-scaling-for-aurora-replicas/">Aurora</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-appstream-2-0-features-fleet-auto-scaling-image-builder-saml-metrics-and-fleet-management/">AppStream 2.0</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-auto-scaling-for-emr-clusters/">EMR</a>. We have also added features such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-target-tracking-policies-for-ec2-auto-scaling/">target tracking</a> to make it easier for you to scale based on the metric that is most appropriate for your application.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Introducing AWS Auto Scaling</strong></span><br /> Today we are making it easier for you to use the Auto Scaling features of multiple AWS services from a single user interface with the introduction of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling" title="">AWS Auto Scaling</a>. This new service unifies and builds on our existing, service-specific, scaling features. It operates on any desired EC2 Auto Scaling groups, EC2 Spot Fleets, ECS tasks, DynamoDB tables, DynamoDB Global Secondary Indexes, and Aurora Replicas that are part of your application, as described by an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" title="">AWS CloudFormation</a> stack or in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/" title="">AWS Elastic Beanstalk</a> (we’re also exploring some other ways to flag a set of resources as an application for use with <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span>).</p> 
<p>You no longer need to set up alarms and scaling actions for each resource and each service. Instead, you simply point <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span> at your application and select the services and resources of interest. Then you select the desired scaling option for each one, and <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span> will do the rest, helping you to discover the scalable resources and then creating a scaling plan that addresses the resources of interest.</p> 
<p>If you have tried to use any of our Auto Scaling options in the past, you undoubtedly understand the trade-offs involved in choosing scaling thresholds. <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span> gives you a variety of scaling options: You can optimize for availability, keeping plenty of resources in reserve in order to meet sudden spikes in demand. You can optimize for costs, running close to the line and accepting the possibility that you will tax your resources if that spike arrives. Alternatively, you can aim for the middle, with a generous but not excessive level of spare capacity. In addition to optimizing for availability, cost, or a blend of both, you can also set a custom scaling threshold. In each case, <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span> will create scaling policies on your behalf, including appropriate upper and lower bounds for each resource.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS Auto Scaling in Action</strong></span><br /> I will use <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span> on a simple CloudFormation stack consisting of an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances and a pair of DynamoDB tables. I start by removing the existing Scaling Policies from my Auto Scaling group:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_delete_old_ec2_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I open up the new <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/awsautoscaling/home">Auto Scaling Console</a> and selecting the stack:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_cons_main_2.png" /></p> 
<p>Behind the scenes, Elastic Beanstalk applications are always launched via a CloudFormation stack. In the screen shot above, <strong>awseb-e-sdwttqizbp-stack</strong> is an Elastic Beanstalk application that I launched.</p> 
<p>I can click on any stack to learn more about it before proceeding:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_cons_my_stack_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I select the desired stack and click on <strong>Next</strong> to proceed. Then I enter a name for my scaling plan and choose the resources that I’d like it to include:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_setup_scaling_2.png" /></p> 
<p>I choose the scaling strategy for each type of resource:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_setup_scaling_ec2_as_1.png" /></p> 
<p>After I have selected the desired strategies, I click <strong>Next</strong> to proceed. Then I review the proposed scaling plan, and click <strong>Create scaling plan</strong> to move ahead:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_make_my_plan_2.png" /></p> 
<p>The scaling plan is created and in effect within a few minutes:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_a_man_a_plan_panama_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I can click on the plan to learn more:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_the_plan_details_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I can also inspect each scaling policy:</p>

<p>I tested my new policy by applying a load to the initial EC2 instance, and watched the scale out activity take place:</p>

<p>We expand AWS by picking a geographic area (which we call a Region) and then building multiple, isolated Availability Zones in that area. Each Availability Zone (AZ) has multiple Internet connections and power connections to multiple grids.</p> 
<p>Today I am happy to announce that we are opening our 50<sup>th</sup> AWS Availability Zone, with the addition of a third AZ to the <span title="">EU (London)</span> Region. This will give you additional flexibility to architect highly scalable, fault-tolerant applications that run across multiple AZs in the UK.</p> 
<p>Since launching the <span title="">EU (London)</span> Region, we have seen an ever-growing set of customers, particularly in the public sector and in regulated industries, use AWS for new and innovative applications. Here are a couple of examples, courtesy of my AWS colleagues in the UK:</p> 
<p><strong>Enterprise</strong> – Some of the UK’s most respected enterprises are using AWS to transform their businesses, including <a href="http://www.bbc.com/">BBC</a>, <a href="http://home.bt.com/">BT</a>, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en.html">Deloitte</a>, and <a href="https://www.travisperkins.co.uk/">Travis Perkins</a>. Travis Perkins is one of the largest suppliers of building materials in the UK and is implementing the biggest systems and business change in its history, including an all-in migration of its data centers to AWS.</p> 
<p><strong>Startups</strong> – Cross-border payments company <a href="https://www.currencycloud.com/en-us/">Currencycloud</a> has migrated its entire payments production, and demo platform to AWS resulting in a 30% saving on their infrastructure costs. <a href="https://www.clearscore.com/">Clearscore</a>, with plans to disrupting the credit score industry, has also chosen to host their entire platform on AWS. <a href="https://www.underwriteme.co.uk/">UnderwriteMe</a> is using the EU (London) Region to offer an underwriting platform to their customers as a managed service.</p> 
<p><strong>Public Sector</strong> -The <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/">Met Office</a> chose AWS to support the <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/mobile-digital-services/weather-app">Met Office Weather App</a>, available for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1068146838?pt=294279&amp;ct=Desktop%20Apps%20page&amp;mt=8">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.gov.metoffice.weather.android&amp;referrer=utm_source%3DMet%2520Office%2520Desktop%2520site%2520apps%2520page">Android</a> phones. Since the Met Office Weather App went live in January 2016, it has attracted more than 4.5 million downloads. Using AWS, the Met Office has been able to increase agility, speed, and scalability while reducing costs. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency">Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency</a> (DVLA) is using the <span title="">EU (London)</span> Region for services such as the Strategic Card Payments platform, which helps the agency achieve PCI DSS compliance.</p> 
<p>The AWS <span title="">EU (London)</span> Region has <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-uk-region-achieves-public-services-network-psn-assurance/">achieved Public Services Network (PSN) assurance</a>, which provides UK Public Sector customers with an assured infrastructure on which to build UK Public Sector services. In conjunction with AWS’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/01/standardized-architecture-for-uk-official-in-the-aws-cloud-quick-start-reference-deployment/">Standardized Architecture for UK-OFFICIAL</a>, PSN assurance enables UK Public Sector organizations to move their UK-OFFICIAL classified data to the <span title="">EU (London)</span> Region in a controlled and risk-managed manner.</p> 
<p>For a complete list of AWS Regions and Services, visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">AWS Global Infrastructure</a> page. As always, pricing for services in the Region can be found on the detail pages; visit our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/products/">Cloud Products</a> page to get started.</p>

<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ces_aces_1.png">INRIX</a>. Bryan’s talk provided a glimpse into the future of transportation, centering around four principle attributes, often abbreviated as ACES:</p> 
<p><strong>Autonomous</strong> – Cars and trucks are gaining the ability to scan and to make sense of their environments and to navigate without human input.</p> 
<p><strong>Connected</strong> – Vehicles of all types have the ability to take advantage of bidirectional connections (either full-time or intermittent) to other cars and to cloud-based resources. They can upload road and performance data, communicate with each other to <a href="http://econosystemics.com/?p=730">run in packs</a>, and take advantage of traffic and weather data.</p> 
<p><strong>Electric</strong> – Continued development of battery and motor technology, will make electrics vehicles more convenient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly.</p> 
<p><strong>Shared</strong> – Ride-sharing services will change usage from an ownership model to an as-a-service model (sound familiar?).</p> 
<p>Individually and in combination, these emerging attributes mean that the cars and trucks we will see and use in the decade to come will be markedly different than those of the past.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>On the Road with AWS</strong></span><br /> AWS customers are already using our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot" title="">AWS IoT</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/">edge computing</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/" title="">Amazon Machine Learning</a>, and <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa">Alexa</a> products to bring this future to life – vehicle manufacturers, their tier 1 suppliers, and AutoTech startups all use AWS for their ACES initiatives. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass" title="">AWS Greengrass</a> is playing an important role here, attracting design wins and helping our customers to add processing power and machine learning inferencing at the edge.</p> 
<p>AWS customer <a href="http://www.aptiv.com/">Aptiv</a> (formerly Delphi) talked about their Automated Mobility on Demand (AMoD) smart vehicle architecture in a <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a> session. Aptiv’s AMoD platform will use Greengrass and microservices to drive the onboard user experience, along with edge processing, monitoring, and control. Here’s an overview:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ces_aptiv_amod_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Another customer, <a href="https://www.denso.com/global/en/">Denso</a> of Japan (one of the world’s largest suppliers of auto components and software) is using Greengrass and AWS IoT to support their vision of <a href="https://www.denso.com/global/en/innovation/technology/maas/">Mobility as a Service</a> (MaaS). Here’s a <a href="https://youtu.be/cu9glnsxgYM?t=35m27s">video</a>:</p> 
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cu9glnsxgYM?t=35m27s"><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ces_ri_denso_1.png" /></a></p> 
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">AWS at CES</span></strong><br /> The AWS team will be out in force at CES in Las Vegas and would love to talk to you. They’ll be running demos that show how AWS can help to bring innovation and personalization to connected and autonomous vehicles.</p> 
<p><strong>Personalized In-Vehicle Experience</strong> – This demo shows how AWS AI and Machine Learning can be used to create a highly personalized and branded in-vehicle experience. It makes use of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lex" title="">Amazon Lex</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/polly" title="">Polly</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/" title="">Amazon Rekognition</a>, but the design is flexible and can be used with other services as well. The demo encompasses driver registration, login and startup (including facial recognition), voice assistance for contextual guidance, personalized e-commerce, and vehicle control. Here’s the architecture for the voice assistance:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ces_demo1_1.png" /></p> 
<p><strong>Connected Vehicle Solution</strong> – This demo shows how a connected vehicle can combine local and cloud intelligence, using edge computing and machine learning at the edge. It handles intermittent connections and uses <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/deeplens/" title="">AWS DeepLens</a> to train a model that responds to distracted drivers. Here’s the overall architecture, as described in our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/iot/connected-vehicle-solution/">Connected Vehicle Solution</a>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ces_demo2_1.png" /></p> 
<p><strong>Digital Content Delivery </strong>– This demo will show how a customer uses a web-based 3D configurator to build and personalize their vehicle. It will also show high resolution (4K) 3D image and an optional immersive AR/VR experience, both designed for use within a dealership.</p> 
<p><strong>Autonomous Driving</strong> – This demo will showcase the AWS services that can be used to build autonomous vehicles. There’s a 1/16th scale model vehicle powered and driven by Greengrass and an overview of a new AWS Autonomous Toolkit. As part of the demo, attendees drive the car, training a model via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/" title="">Amazon SageMaker</a> for subsequent on-board inferencing, powered by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/ml/">Greengrass ML Inferencing</a>.</p> 
<p>To speak to one of my colleagues or to set up a time to see the demos, check out the <a href="http://go.amazonsellerservices.com/ces18/aws">Visit AWS at CES 2018</a> page.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Some Resources</strong></span><br /> If you are interested in this topic and want to learn more, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/automotive/">AWS for Automotive</a> page is a great starting point, with discussions on connected vehicles &amp; mobility, autonomous vehicle development, and digital customer engagement.</p> 
<p>When you are ready to start building a connected vehicle, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/iot/connected-vehicle-solution/">AWS Connected Vehicle Solution</a> contains a reference architecture that combines local computing, sophisticated event rules, and cloud-based data processing and storage.
