<p>As described in the <a href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS-Security-Pillar.pdf">Security Pillar </a>of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/">AWS Well-Architected Framework</a>, the careful management of the security configurations of the running systems within your environment forms the foundation of how you will maintain robust, secure, scalable systems.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.chef.io/inspec/">InSpec by Chef</a>, an open-source testing framework, provides teams the ability to define and assess system state and status across the entire application lifecycle. InSpec can already be used with AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate to track the compliance of your infrastructure based on predefined policies. For example, you can describe compliance controls in InSpec and integrate these tests into any stage of your deployment pipeline or choose from a set of pre-packaged InSpec profiles. You can then use the Compliance pane as a unified dashboard to identify issues, remediate them, and track progress for various nodes and profiles.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>“According to the Chef User Survey 2017, 55% of organizations do compliance assessments incompletely or not at all,” says James Casey, Vice President of Partner Engineering and Integration at Chef. “Amazon Web Services and Chef help customers identify and automate compliance by using InSpec, part of Chef’s integration with AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate. Now, customers have more options to use InSpec’s framework with the addition of InSpec availability through AWS Systems Manager.”</em></p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>In this blog post, I’ll focus on three features of AWS Systems Manager that can be used with InSpec:</p> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/features/#Run_Command">Run Command</a>—Provides a simple way of running an ad hoc scan of your infrastructure using InSpec.</li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/features/#State_Manager">State Manager</a>—Allows you to execute InSpec tests on a schedule so that you can continuously assess the compliance of your systems.</li> 
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-compliance.html">Configuration Compliance</a> –Collects and aggregates information about InSpec test results.</li> 
<p><span id="more-2726"></span>I’ll use the newly defined Systems Manager Document <strong>AWS-RunInSpecChecks</strong> to run InSpec profiles that check the configuration of both Windows and Linux servers against a security baseline.</p> 
<p>Here’s an outline of the steps:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Launch Systems Manager Managed Instances.</li> 
<li>Ensure you have an <a href="https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/">InSpec Profile</a>. In this blog you will use predefined profiles from the <a href="https://github.com/dev-sec">DevSec Hardening Framework</a> project on GitHub to check both Linux and Windows servers against a security baseline.</li> 
<li>Execute the InSpec tests using Run Command or State Manager. You don’t need InSpec installed your servers because the scripts will do that for you.</li> 
<li>View the results of your tests in Compliance.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/03/04/001_arch_diagram.png" /></p> 
<b>Launch Managed Instances</b> 
<p>You need at least one <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/managed_instances.html">managed instance</a> that can act as a target of InSpec test execution. You can skip this step if you already have one or more Systems Manager managed instances in your AWS Account.</p> 
<p>Otherwise, you can launch an AWS CloudFormation stack that launches two Amazon EC2 instances, one Windows Server 2012 R2 Base and one Amazon Linux, to act as test managed instances. The stack also creates an IAM Role and Instance Profile with the AmazonEC2RoleforSSM managed policy.</p> 
<p>The following link launches the stack in the us-east-1 (N. Virginia) Region:</p> 
<p><a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=SSM-InSpec&amp;templateURL=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/management-tools-blog-cf-template-storage/ssm_inspec_test_servers.template"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/03/04/cloudformation-launch-stack.png" /></a></p> 
<p>The CloudFormation template requires the following parameters:</p> 
<li><strong>KeyPair</strong>: Choose an Amazon EC2 key pair from the list. Ensure that you have the private key corresponding to the key pair.</li> 
<li><strong>Subnet</strong>: Choose a subnet where the instances will be launched. Ensure that the subnet has outbound access to Internet addresses and to the Systems Manager API endpoints via an<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html"> Internet Gateway</a>, a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-nat-gateway.html">NAT Gateway</a> or a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-setting-up-vpc.html">VPC Endpoint for Systems Manager</a>.</li> 
<li><strong>VpcId</strong>: Choose the VPC for the subnet you chose in Subnet.</li> 
<p>The CloudFormation stack provides the following outputs:</p> 
<li><strong>LinuxServer</strong>: The EC2 instance ID of the Linux server.</li> 
<li><strong>WindowsServer</strong>: The EC2 instance ID of the Windows server.</li> 
<b>Create a Parameter to store your GitHub token</b> 
<p>You need a GitHub personal token to download InSpec profiles from GitHub. Follow the steps in <a href="https://github.com/join">Join GitHub</a> to create a GitHub account if you don’t already have one, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/">create a token</a> and save the token in a secure location.</p> 
<p>You can use Parameter Store to store your GitHub personal access token using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS CLI</a>:</p> 
aws ssm put-parameter --name 'github-personal-token' --description 'GitHub Personal Token' --type SecureString --value '&lt;value&gt;' 
<p>Or you can perform these steps using the Systems Manager console:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the Systems Manager console. Choose <strong>Parameter Store</strong> from the left navigation pane. Then choose <strong>Create Parameter</strong>.<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/03/04/002.png" /></li> 
<li>For <strong>Name</strong>, type <strong>github-personal-token</strong>.</li> 
<li>For <strong>Description</strong>, type <strong>GitHub Personal Token</strong>.</li> 
<li>For <strong>Type</strong>, choose <strong>SecureString</strong> and accept the default KMS Key ID <strong>alias/aws/ssm</strong>.</li> 
<li>For <strong>Value</strong>, copy and paste the value of the GitHub personal token you saved earlier.</li> 
<li>Choose <strong>Create parameter</strong> to create the parameter.</li> 
</ol> 
<b>Execute InSpec tests on Windows Servers</b> 
<p>In this step, you’ll execute an InSpec Profile against a Windows server. An InSpec Profile organizes multiple controls to support dependency management and code reuse. Each profile is a standalone structure with its own distribution and execution flow.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Log into the Systems Manager console and choose <strong>Run Command</strong> from the left navigation pane.</li> 
<li>Choose <strong>Run Command</strong>.</li> 
<li>In the search bar, choose to search by <strong>Document name prefix</strong>. Choose <strong>Equal</strong> as the condition and type <strong>AWS-Run</strong> as the prefix. From the list of Command documents, choose the document named <strong>AWS-RunInSpecChecks</strong>.</li> 
<li>Choose the Targets (either instances or tags). You can narrow the list to Windows servers in the search bar by choosing the filter <strong>Platform</strong> and choosing <strong>Windows</strong>.<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/03/04/003.png" /></li> 
<li>In the <strong>Command parameters</strong> section, choose <strong>Github</strong> as the <strong>Source Type</strong>. Type the following into the text area for <strong>Source Info</strong> to execute an InSpec profile that checks Windows servers against a <a href="https://github.com/dev-sec/windows-baseline">security baseline</a> defined by the <a href="https://github.com/dev-sec">DevSec Hardening Framework</a> project on GitHub. {
&quot;owner&quot;:&quot;dev-sec&quot;,
&quot;repository&quot;:&quot;windows-baseline&quot;,
&quot;path&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
&quot;getOptions&quot; : &quot;branch:master&quot;,
&quot;tokenInfo&quot;:&quot;{{ssm-secure:github-personal-token}}&quot;
} <p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/03/04/004.png" /></p></li> 
<li>Accept the default values for the remaining parameters and choose <strong>Run</strong>.</li> 
<li>Refresh the Command status page until the status for the instances shown in the <strong>Targets and outputs list</strong> changes from <strong>In Progress</strong> to <strong>Success</strong>.</li> 
<li>Choose an instance ID from the list to see the output of the command run. Expand the steps shown on the <strong>Output</strong> page to view the command output.<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/03/04/005.png" /></li> 
<li>Verify that the output of the runInSpecWindows step shows that the execution was successful and has a line showing the number of tests executed and the number that were compliant and non-compliant. Note that the scripts install the <a href="https://docs.chef.io/about_chefdk.html">Chef Development Kit</a> (chefdk), execute InSpec tests, and then uninstall chefdk. For example: Installing Chef Development Kit
Installing chefdk from C:\Windows\TEMP\chefdk-2.4.22-1-x64.msi
Executing InSpec tests
Completed InSpec checks and put 27 compliant (27 critical, 0 high, 0 low) and 47 non-compliant (39 critical, 0 high, 8 low) items
Uninstalling Chef Development Kit <p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/03/04/006.png" /></p></li> 
</ol> 
<b>View Compliance items</b> 
<p>In this step, you’ll view the results of the tests in Systems Manager Compliance.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Log into the Systems Manager console and choose <strong>Explore Built-in insights</strong>.</li> 
<li>Choose <strong>Compliance</strong> from the navigation pane on the left.</li> 
<li>A summary of compliance items is shown as a chart, and the list of managed instances is displayed.<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/03/04/007.png" /></li> 
<li>Choose a Managed Instance to view a list of compliance items of type Custom:InSpec that were created as a result of the InSpec tests executed. You can see that each item has a descriptive title, the compliance status: whether it is compliant (the test passed) or non-compliant (the test failed), and severity.<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/03/04/008.png" /></li> 
</ol> 
<b>Execute InSpec tests on Linux servers</b> 
<p>To execute InSpec tests on Linux servers, follow the steps in the previous section, but choose one or more Linux servers in Step 4. In Step 6, type the following for Source Info to execute an InSpec profile that checks Linux servers against the <a href="https://github.com/dev-sec/ssh-baseline">SSH baseline</a> defined by the <a href="https://github.com/dev-sec">DevSec Hardening Framework</a> project.</p> 
{

&quot;getOptions&quot; : &quot;branch:master&quot;,
&quot;tokenInfo&quot;:&quot;{{ssm-secure:github-personal-token}}&quot;
} 
<p>You can also choose to execute a sample cross-platform InSpec profile that checks for open SSH and RDP ports. Type the following for <strong>Source Info</strong> and chose a combination of Linux and Windows servers.</p> 
{
&quot;owner&quot;: &quot;awslabs&quot;,
&quot;repository&quot;: &quot;amazon-ssm&quot;,

} 
<b>Conclusion</b> 
<p>In this blog post, I have shown how Systems Manager now lets you run compliance scans using InSpec by Chef. The walk-throughs used Run Command to execute individual tests. You can also create <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-state-assoc.html">State Manager Associations</a> to execute these tests on a schedule so that you can continuously assess the compliance of your systems.</p>

<b>Cleaning up</b> 
<p>If you launched instances using the CloudFormation template described earlier, you can delete those resources to avoid being charged for them going forward.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>In the CloudFormation console, choose the stack named <strong>SSM-InSpec</strong>, and from <strong>Actions</strong>, choose <strong>Delete Stack</strong>.</li> 
<li>Refresh the <strong>Events</strong> tab of the stack until the stack disappears from the stack list.</li>

</footer> 
<p>To help customers rapidly prototype, develop, and deploy their custom <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/config">AWS Config</a> rules at scale, AWS introduces a new version of the AWS Config Rule Development Kit (RDK).</p> 
<p>The RDK is a command-line utility designed to help you to shorten your security and compliance feedback cycles when using Config. It helps you build a continuous compliance framework that your auditors will love. It can be included in an end-to-end DevSecOps pipeline or used interactively from your command line to create and atomically deploy the Config, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda">AWS Lambda</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam">IAM</a> resources necessary for your custom Config use case.</p> 
<p>In this post, I show you how to get started with the RDK.<span id="more-2669"></span></p> 
<b><strong>Background</strong></b> 
<p>Config is a native service for continuous compliance. It allows you to track the changes to resources and configurations (configuration items) in your account. You can define rules that detect when configuration items have drifted into undesirable territory.</p> 
<p>Config has a number of out-of-the-box rules that cover many the common use cases for customers. You can also create custom Config Rules backed by Lambda functions. Many enterprise customers or customers operating in highly regulated industries have special requirements that need specific definitions of compliant. I also see customers using the robust, serverless Config framework to build other housekeeping functionality such as cost and security controls.</p> 
<b>Getting Started</b> 
<p>The first steps are to make sure that you have the necessary permissions in your AWS account, and then you can install the tool itself.</p> 
<h3>Prerequisites</h3> 
<p>To get started, you need an AWS account, and necessary permissions for modifying Config rules, Lambda functions, and various IAM resources within that account. The <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-config-rdk/blob/master/policy/rdk-minimum-permissions.json">rdk-minimum-permissions.json</a> sample policy document illustrates the required permissions.</p> 
<p>RDK allows you to author Lambda functions in almost all of the supported languages. It is itself written in Python, and is compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3.6. The recommended installation method is through pip (<code>pip install rdk</code>). To see the source code (or even contribute!), clone the GitHub aws-config-rdk repo.</p> 
<p>You can make sure that it is installed correctly by typing rdk at a command prompt. You should see usage instructions and an error about required arguments.</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">
(rdk-demo) 186590d1e043:rdk-demo USER $ rdk
usage: rdk [-h] [-p PROFILE] [-k ACCESS_KEY_ID] [-s SECRET_ACCESS_KEY]
[-r REGION]
&lt;command&gt; ...
rdk: error: the following arguments are required: &lt;command&gt;, 
&lt;command arguments&gt;
</code> 
<h3>Runtime-specific prerequisites</h3> 
<p>Config rules backed by Python and Node.js Lambda functions can be deployed without any additional setup. To use either the Java 8 or .NET Core runtimes, you need some additional components:</p> 
<li>Java: Use gradle to build your deployment package, so install it somewhere accessible from your CLI.</li> 
<li>.NET: Microsoft ships a CLI for .NET called “dotnet” that you need installed, as well as the latest release of the .NET Core framework v1.0. These are necessary to build and create Lambda deployment packages for your .NET code.</li> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<b>Workflow</b> 
<p>Now that you have the RDK installed, walk through the steps to create, deploy, and manage your custom Config rules.</p> 
<h3>Set credentials</h3> 
<p>RDK uses the boto3 libraries for AWS API access, so any of the standard methods of passing credentials work. For more information about ways to supply your credentials, see options 3 through 8 in <a href="http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/configuration.html">Credentials</a> in the Boto documentation. Alternately, you can pass them in with the following command-line parameters:</p> 
<li>–profile</li> 
<li>–region</li> 
<li>–access-key-id</li> 
<li>–secret-access-key</li> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Initialize</h3> 
<p>Use <code>rdk init</code> to create a working directory. The working directory holds your rule definitions, as well as a snapshot of template files used to build your Config rules. Ideally, your working directory is a local code repo and python virtualenv, but it’s not necessary for just playing around. The <code>init</code> command also configures AWS Config in the account specified by your credentials. Config begins tracking information about your resources and their configurations.</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">
(rdk-demo) 1234567890ab:rdk-demo USER$ rdk init
Running init!
Found Config Recorder: default
Found Config Role: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/config-role
Found Bucket: config-bucket-123456789012
Config Service is ON
Config setup complete.
Found code bucket: config-rule-code-bucket-123456789012us-west-2
</code> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Create or modify</h3> 
<p>Now it’s time to create some rules!</p> 
<p>Use <code>rdk create &lt;rulename&gt; --runtime &lt;runtime&gt;</code> to create a local rule folder that contains your initial rule code, as well as some helper code and the parameters used to deploy the rule later. You need to specify a valid Lambda runtime. Optional flags include resource types for triggering on configuration change events, the frequency for scheduled evaluations, and any parameters that Config passes on to the backing Lambda function.</p> 
<p>To change rule parameters later on, you can use <code>rdk modify &lt;rulename&gt; --&lt;flag&gt; &lt;option&gt;</code> to overwrite any of the options that were previously set for your local rule definition.</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">
(rdk-demo) 1234567890ab:rdk-demo USER$ rdk create MyTestRule --runtime python3.6 --resource-types AWS::EC2::Instance
Running create!
Defaulting to TwentyFour_Hours Maximum Frequency.
Local Rule files created.
</code> 
<h3>Edit</h3> 
<p>Navigate to the folder created by create and you see a number of files, depending on the runtime that you selected.</p> 
<p>Config rules backed by Python or Node.js Lambda functions have a .py or .js file named the same as your<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/02/19/file_structure.png" /> rule name, which is the code template to which to add your custom logic. There are other files associated with each runtime that provide necessary functions to validate inputs, submit compliance results back to Config, and handle errors and logging. You probably don’t need to worry about these.</p> 
<p>Go ahead and add whatever logic you want based on the CI, rule parameters, or any other data that your function should pull out of your AWS environment. Just make you return a valid compliance result. If you are writing your Lambda function in Java, make sure that you update the build.gradle file with any dependencies that you add.</p> 
<h3>Deploy</h3> 
<p>Now you’re ready to deploy your custom rule to AWS!</p> 
<p>From your working directory, use <code>rdk deploy &lt;rulename&gt;</code> to push your changes out to AWS. This uses AWS CloudFormation behind the scenes to build your Config rule, Lambda function. It also creates the necessary policies and permissions to let them talk to one another. You can list multiple rules to deploy, or use the <code>–all</code> flag to push all of the rules in your working directory. If you are using either Java or .NET, this also compiles your code and packages it appropriately for Lambda deployment.</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">
(rdk-demo) 1234567890ab:rdk-demo USER$ rdk deploy MyTestRule
Running deploy!
Zipping MyTestRule
Uploading MyTestRule
Updating CloudFormation Stack for MyTestRule
Waiting for CloudFormation stack operation to complete...
Waiting for CloudFormation stack operation to complete...
Waiting for CloudFormation stack operation to complete...
Publishing Lambda code...
Lambda code updated.
Config deploy complete.
</code> 
<h3>Monitor</h3> 
<p>After your rule has successfully deployed, you’ll want to know what it’s actually doing!</p> 
<p>It can be useful to instrument your Lambda function with some logging so that you can have some debugging output about the decisions that your function is making. RDK provides a quick way to get a view into your function with the <code>logs</code> command. It has command-line arguments for how many log events to look back, and also supports the <code>–f</code> flag for continuously polling the log group for the specified function and returning results as they happen.</p> 
<p>The following is an example of the <code>logs</code> command:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">
(rdk-demo) 1234567890ab:rdk-demo USER$ rdk logs MyTestRule/ -f

</code> 
<p>From the logs, make sure that your rule is functioning as expected. If you have a bug in your logic, iterate quickly by editing the rule code and re-deploying in seconds.</p> 
<p>After you’ve deployed your rule and verified that it’s working correctly, you can see your compliance status in the AWS Config console.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/02/19/screen_shot.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<b>Conclusion</b> 
<p>I’m excited about the ways that the RDK can empower AWS customers to build world-class, enterprise-level compliance controls quickly and easily, leaving the heavy-lifting of the machinery and the framework to AWS Config.</p> 
<p>Config is a powerful component in a cloud-based, end-to-end security and compliance framework. Its ability to track changes over time is a great complement for Amazon CloudWatch Events, which gives you near-real-time responsiveness to individual API calls.</p>

<p>AWS CloudFormation treats a stack as a collection of AWS resources that customers can manage as a single unit. After you launch a stack, you can use the AWS CloudFormation console, API, or AWS CLI to update resources in your stacks. You should not make any changes to stack resources outside of CloudFormation. This is due to something we call resource drift. Resource drift occurs when you make out-of-band changes to CloudFormation managed resources that can cause errors if you later update or delete the stack.</p> 
<p>This blog post walks you through examples of how to recover your stack from states such as <em>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED</em>. We show you how to regain control of the stack to perform further updates using CloudFormation without intervention from AWS Support.</p> 
<p><span id="more-2526"></span></p> 
<b><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a name="update_rollback_failed"></a>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED</span></b> 
<p>Out-of-band changes can easily occur when there are newcomers to your organization who make accidental changes to resources created by CloudFormation. These changes can also be made by members of different teams who might not have awareness of the service. Out-of-band changes can cause your CloudFormation stack to enter a state in which you are no longer able to continue modifying the stack. When a stack reaches UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED, this means that the CloudFormation stack was attempting an UPDATE operation, the operation failed, and we began a rollback. An issue occurred that stopped CloudFormation from returning to the previous “good” state during the rollback. As a result, the stack can’t update and can’t roll back, thus it assumes this half-way state. The API then stops any further actions on the stack other than ContinueUpdateRollback and DeleteStack.</p> 
<b><a name="continueupdaterollback"></a>ContinueUpdateRollback</b> 
<p>The <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-continueupdaterollback.html">ContinueUpdateRollback API</a> operation provides customers an override for stacks in an UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state. It forces CloudFormation to continue with the rollback procedure. Use this operation only for troubleshooting. When a failure occurs and the stack enters an UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state, the API operation simply continues the rollback. However, it provides no fix to the underlying issue. For example, it doesn’t fix the underlying issue of whether a rollback failed due to an account limit. If you don’t address this account limit constraint, ContinueUpdateRollback will simply retry the rollback and fail once more. You still need to fix the underlying problem separately and, in a break from best-practices, outside of AWS CloudFormation.</p> 
<b>A practical example</b> 
<p>We’ll walk you through a scenario involving stacks entering the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state and the use of the Auto Scaling service. Let’s take a look at a CloudFormation template.</p> 
<p><b>Note</b>: This template can be deployed in any Region as long as you specify a valid HVM-compatible Amazon Machine Image (AMI) on launch. Alternatively, to launch it <i>as-is</i> use the Europe (London) (eu-west-2) Region.</p>

</code> 
<p>As you can see, we create an Auto Scaling group with a launch configuration and our stack is created just as we expected.</p> 
<h3><a name="chaos-ensues"></a>Chaos ensues</h3> 
<p>To continue our hypothetical, let’s pretend that we hire Jimmy, a new member of the operations team fresh out his AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam. One day, while you are not around, the development team asks him to decrease the size of the instance type for the Auto Scaling group. He decides it’s best to create a cool new launch configuration for the running the Auto Scaling group and assign the new launch configuration to the group:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">aws autoscaling create-launch-configuration --launch-configuration-name Jimmys_new_LC --image-id ami-1a7f6d7e --instance-type t2.nano --region eu-west-2
ASName=`aws cloudformation describe-stack-resources --stack-name &lt;stack-name&gt; --logical-resource-id ASG --output text --query StackResources[0].PhysicalResourceId --region eu-west-2`
aws autoscaling update-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name $ASName --launch-configuration-name Jimmys_new_LC --region eu-west-2
</code> 
<p>Of course, he also decides to clean up the old Auto Scaling launch configuration for good measure:</p> 
<p>(For your ease of replication, I include the first line below to fetch the physical ID of the launch configuration created by the previous template.)</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">LCName=`aws cloudformation describe-stack-resources --stack-name &lt;stack-name&gt; --logical-resource-id LC --output text --query StackResources[0].PhysicalResourceId --region eu-west-2`
aws autoscaling delete-launch-configuration --launch-configuration-name $LCName --region eu-west-2
</code> 
<p>Oh Jimmy, we had such high hopes…</p> 
<h3><a name="rollbacks-and-stabilization"></a>Rollbacks and stabilization</h3> 
<p>In the majority of my tests AWS CloudFormation attempts to fail fast. For example, if we were to add a HealthCheckType with an incorrect value, the initial API call would fail and the stack would roll back. However, because CloudFormation did not replace or successfully change the configuration of the target resource, it correctly assumes that no API call is necessary in order to roll back.</p> 
<p>A rollback can trigger a reapplication of a previous configuration after a period of time. CloudFormation refers to this as stabilization. CloudFormation performs an API call on behalf of a user, and in addition, it attempts to ensure that, when a resource is labeled as CREATE COMPLETE, the resource is running in the desired state. For Auto Scaling for example, it sends a CreateAutoScalingGroup API call and then attempts to DescribeAutoScalingGroup until the group has a Min/Max and Desired count equal to the count defined in the template. If this doesn’t occur, CloudFormation must then reapply the previous configuration.</p> 
<h3><a name="forcing-a-rollback"></a>Forcing a rollback</h3> 
<p>In our example, we could force this type of failure by increasing the Auto Scaling group’s capacity past our account limit for running On-Demand instances. This would in turn fail stabilization and trigger our rollback. At this point CloudFormation would be unable to find the previously defined launch configuration and the stack would then enter the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state. However, this would involve launching a number of unused instances, which would not be very frugal. Instead, we can use the CloudFormation Wait Condition resource to simulate a failure and force a rollback.</p> 
<p>This is how we update the CloudFormation template:</p> 
<code class="lang-yaml">AWSTemplateFormatVersion: &quot;2010-09-09&quot;
Description: &quot;A template used to illustrate the use of ContinueUpdateRollback API when recovering CloudFormation stacks from Update Rollback Failed&quot;

ResourceSignal:

</code> 
<p class="FirstParagraph">As you can see, the template updates our launch configuration to use t2.large instances. However, because we never signal our WaitCondition, the stack will roll back. At this point CloudFormation will attempt to reapply the launch configuration. However, as we saw earlier, Jimmy deleted our launch configuration. So any update on the stack that updates the Auto Scaling group and triggers a rollback will fail.</p> 
<h3><a name="general-guidance-on-recovering-stuck-sta"></a>General guidance on recovering <i>stuck</i> stacks</h3> 
<p class="FirstParagraph">To address issues with CloudFormation stacks that have entered UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state you have three options:</p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 24.0pt;text-indent: -24.0pt">1.<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman'"><code> </code></span>Delete the stack. If the deletion fails for any reason, you can then use the DeleteStack API operation with the RetainResources option listing resources that failed deletion.</p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 24.0pt;text-indent: -24.0pt">2. Make underlying account changes manually/outside the scope of the stack to re-synchronize the stack with the expectation and then perform ContinueUpdateRollback.</p> 
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 24.0pt;text-indent: -24.0pt">3. If you address the issues with the underlying stack resources you canuse ContinueUpdateRollback along with the ResourcesToSkip option. CloudFormation will mark the problematic/failing resources as UPDATE_COMPLETE and continue with the rest of the rollback.</p> 
<h3><a name="saving-the-day"></a>Saving the day</h3> 
<p>Now to address Jimmy’s mistake. With experience we know that CloudFormation relies on resource names or IDs to keep track of ownership. With launch configurations, we can see that the service uses a combination of the StackName, LogicalId, and a random string to name the launch configuration.</p> 
<p>What we can do is create a new launch configuration using the precise name of the previous one. We can grab that name by describing our stack as before then follow that up with a ContinueUpdateRollback:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">LCName=`aws cloudformation describe-stack-resources --stack-name &lt;stack-name&gt; --logical-resource-id LC --output text --query StackResources[0].PhysicalResourceId`
aws autoscaling create-launch-configuration --launch-configuration-name $LCName --image-id ami-1a7f6d7e --instance-type t2.micro --region eu-west-2
aws cloudformation continue-update-rollback --stack-name &lt;stack-name&gt; --region eu-west-2
</code> 
<p class="FirstParagraph">Our stack should now be back to UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE and ready for us to perform our update again.</p> 
<code class="lang-basg">aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name &lt;stack-name&gt; --query Stacks[0].StackStatus –region eu-west-2
&quot;UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE&quot;</code> 
<p class="FirstParagraph">In our example we forced the rollback by adding a never-completing WaitCondition. In your case the cause might be due to account limitations or other issues.</p> 
<b>When replacement is not an option</b> 
<p>In our example, we were left in the lucky situation in which you can replace the removed resource easily by naming a new resource the same name that your stack expects. Let’s take a look at a situation in which a resource was deleted that does not have a custom-name.</p> 
<p>Consider the following CloudFormation template:</p> 
<code class="lang-yaml">AWSTemplateFormatVersion: &quot;2010-09-09&quot;
Description: &quot;A template used to illustrate the use of ContinueUpdateRollback API when recovering CloudFormation stacks from Update Rollback Failed&quot;
Parameters: 
pAMI:

pVPC:

SecurityGroupEgress:
- IpProtocol: tcp
FromPort: '80'
ToPort: '80'
CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
</code> 
<p>In this template we are creating an instance and a security group. Let’s pretend our old friend Jimmy was this time instructed to alter the EC2 instance and reference the default VPC security group:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">defaultSecGroup=`aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-name default --query SecurityGroups[0].GroupId --output text --region eu-west-2`
stackSecGroup=`aws cloudformation describe-stack-resources --stack-name &lt;stack-name&gt; --logical-resource-id InstanceSecurityGroup --output text --query StackResources[0].PhysicalResourceId --region eu-west-2`
instance=`aws cloudformation describe-stack-resources --stack-name &lt;stack-name&gt; --logical-resource-id Instance --output text --query StackResources[0].PhysicalResourceId --region eu-west-2`
aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id $instance --group $defaultSecGroup --region eu-west-2
aws ec2 delete-security-group --group-id $stackSecGroup --region eu-west-2
</code> 
<p>And then, once again we update our stack with the failing wait condition to simulate a failure and initiate a rollback:</p> 
<code class="lang-yaml">AWSTemplateFormatVersion: &quot;2010-09-09&quot;
Description: &quot;A template used to illustrate the use of ContinueUpdateRollback API when recovering CloudFormation stacks from Update Rollback Failed&quot;

</code> 
<p>The stack is now in the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state due to the ‘Instance’ resource being unable to rollback with an error like:</p> 
<p><em><strong>The security group ‘sg-xxxxxxxx’ does not exist</strong></em></p> 
<p>This time, to recover, because we can’t re-create sg-xxxxxxxx with the exact ID, we will have to continue the rollback and skip past the instance so that we can continue to modify the stack and regain a working and synced state.</p> 
<p>The first step is to perform continue-update-rollback skipping the resource:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">aws cloudformation continue-update-rollback --resources-to-skip Instance --region eu-west-2</code> 
<p>The stack would now be in the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state. However, the state of the stack no longer matches the state of the underlying resources. The instance, while still running, will have the default EC2 security group assigned to it by Jimmy instead of the security group we have defined here in the stack. To rectify this, we have to modify our template so that the instance is updated with a different security group ID. We can also remove the reference to the old, now deleted group from our template and use this as the new group for the instance:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">AWSTemplateFormatVersion: &quot;2010-09-09&quot;
Description: &quot;A template used to illustrate the use of ContinueUpdateRollback API when recovering CloudFormation stacks from Update Rollback Failed&quot;

SecurityGroupEgress:

ToPort: '80'
CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
</code> 
<p>Our stack should now be back in a state that is synchronized with the underlying resources and in a state that allows for further modifications down the line.</p> 
<b>Conclusion</b> 
<p>Throughout this blog, we learned about various CloudFormation concepts such as rollbacks, stabilization and using the ContinueUpdateRollback operation. We showed you two examples of using ContinueUpdateRollback to rescue a stack from a stuck state. In the first example we simply alter an underlying value then perform the API call. In the second example we have to skip past the problematic resource (due to the fact that it uses a unique ID instead of a user-defined value).</p>

<p>Recently, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/config/">AWS Config</a> announced support for Auto Scaling groups. You can now track configuration changes in Auto Scaling groups, such as minimum, maximum, and desired capacities, termination policies, scaling policies, subnets, and instance protection settings.</p> 
<p>You can also use a new managed AWS Config rule to check whether the Auto Scaling groups associated with your load balancers are using the Elastic Load Balancing health checks to determine the health state of your Amazon EC2 instances.</p> 
<p>In this post, I describe two possible ways that you could track changes to Auto Scaling groups and evaluate compliance. I’ll walk you through each scenario.</p> 
<p><span id="more-2483"></span></p> 
<p><strong>AWS services</strong><br /> AWS Config enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. It continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations. With AWS Config, you can review changes in configurations and relationships between AWS resources, dive into detailed resource configuration histories, and determine your overall compliance against the configurations specified in your internal guidelines.</p> 
<p>An Auto Scaling group is a collection of EC2 instances, with similar configuration and characteristics, that are used for the purpose of scaling and management. These EC2 instances in the Auto Scaling group are treated as a logical group. You can configure the Auto Scaling group with the capacity that you want for instances required for the application to operate. You can configure the group with the minimum and maximum instances, depending on which instances Auto Scaling can launch or terminate based on dynamic scaling.</p> 
<p><strong>Example: Track configuration changes</strong></p> 
<p>Let’s consider a scenario where a customer notices an increase in his Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) bill for a prior month. He notices that there are Amazon EC2 charges related to the use of an m4.xlarge instance type. The customer is confused because his applications have always used t2.micro instances, so he investigates further. He notices that when a scale out happens, the instances launched by the Auto Scaling group are of type m4.xlarge, instead of t2.micro. So it appears that the Auto Scaling launch configuration must have been modified.</p> 
<p>AWS Config can help you investigate in this scenario and determine if and when any configuration changes occurred on the Auto Scaling launch configuration, since it maintains a history of all configuration changes to the Auto Scaling group. We use the AWS Management Console in this scenario, but you can use the AWS CLI or SDKs as well.</p> 
<p>First, log in to the AWS Config console. For <strong>Resources</strong>, choose <strong>AutoScaling: AutoScaling Group</strong>. Choose <strong>Look up</strong> to see the list of Auto Scaling groups that AWS Config has automatically discovered in your account. The following screenshot shows an example Auto Scaling group on the <strong>Resource inventory</strong> page.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/01/12/AS-group-resources-1024x416.png" /></p> 
<p>Look at the <strong>Config timeline</strong> for the <strong>AS- APP1 – AS group</strong>. The following screenshot shows the timeline and configuration details.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/01/12/LC-change-1-1024x303.png" /></p> 
<p>The timeline shows you all configuration changes that were made after the Auto Scaling group was created.</p> 
<p>Choose <strong>Changes</strong> and notice that a change was made on the 31st August to the Auto Scaling group configuration, when the launch configuration was changed from AS-APP1-Launch config to AS-APPv2-Launch config.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/01/12/LC-change-2.png" /></p> 
<p>Let’s open the EC2 console to check the Auto Scaling launch configurations. We can confirm that the instance type associated with the new launch configuration is m4.xlarge.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/02/14/AS-group-m4xlarge-1024x265.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Here is another example of tracking configuration changes using AWS Config. In this example, let’s assume that you are seeing performance degradations for applications hosted on your EC2 instances. Open the Amazon CloudWatch console. You can see spikes but are unable to understand why Auto Scaling did not dynamically scale out based on the CPU threshold scaling policy which was set to scale at 60 percent of average CPU.</p> 
<p>Go back to the AWS Config console. For <strong>Resources</strong>, choose <strong>AutoScaling: ScalingPolicy</strong>. Choose <strong>Look up</strong> to see the list of Auto Scaling Policies that AWS Config has automatically discovered in your account. The following screenshot shows an example Auto Scaling policy on the <strong>Resource inventory</strong> page</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/01/12/AS-group-resources-1.png" /></p> 
<p>Look at the Config timeline for Scale Group Size scaling policy. The following screenshot shows the timeline and configuration details.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/01/12/scaling-policy-changes-scale-1024x281.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Choose <strong>Changes</strong> and notice that a change was made on 4th September to the Scaling policy configuration, when the target value for Average CPU threshold was changed from 60 to 90 percent. This explains why the scale out did not happen as soon as the CPU spiked over 60 percent.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/02/14/Screen-Shot-2017-09-05-at-10.38.06-AM.jpg" /></p> 
<p>Using this information, you can fix these Auto Scaling configuration issues in the EC2 console.</p> 
<p>Another common scenario some customers have experienced is noticing too many instances in their account. This is because the instance termination policy has been enabled, which does not terminate your instances when the scale-in happens. This can be identified using the AWS Config service as well.</p> 
<p><strong>Example: Verify Heath Check using AWS Config rules</strong></p> 
<p>In addition to tracking the configuration of your Auto Scaling service, you can use AWS Config rules to check your Auto Scaling groups against best practices and internal policies.</p> 
<p>For example, use the prebuilt rules called <strong>autoscaling-group-elb-healthcheck-required</strong> to check whether your Auto Scaling groups that are associated with a load balancer are using Elastic Load Balancing health checks.</p> 
<p>Auto Scaling groups use Amazon EC2 health checks by default to determine the health of an instance. In situations where EC2 instances are running behind a load balancer, it’s beneficial to leverage the load balancer health checks for EC2 instances instead of Amazon EC2 health checks. This is because the load balancer health checks can determine the health of the application running on top of the EC2 instances, unlike the Amazon EC2 health checks.</p> 
<p>Here’s an example that shows how you can use AWS Config to troubleshoot a scenario where customers notice service errors or failures for the applications hosted on Amazon EC2 behind a load balancer even though the EC2 instance is healthy, reachable, and running.</p> 
<p>On the EC2 console, you can see that the EC2 instances healthy and running. But customers are still reporting errors while running your application. After some troubleshooting you determine that there are issues with the web service running on top of your EC2 instances. Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancers have the capability to detect such failures via application-specific health checks and stop directing traffic to the affected EC2 instances. But since the Auto Scaling group isn’t configured to leverage the ELB health checks, customer requests are still hitting the unhealthy EC2 instances.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/02/14/elb-hc-instance-status.png" /></p> 
<p>AWS Config can help you identify Auto Scaling groups with this misconfiguration so that you can take corrective action. With the prebuilt rules called <strong>autoscaling-group-elb-healthcheck-required</strong> we can identify Auto Scaling groups that do not use ELB health checks. These resources are “non-compliant” as far as the AWS Config rule is concerned, as seen in the AWS Config console:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/02/14/elb-hc-nc.png" /></p> 
<p>Go to the EC2 console to change the health check type to ELB in the Auto Scaling group. When you return to the AWS Config console, you can see that the compliance status for the Auto Scaling group changes to the compliant state.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/01/12/ELB-hc-complaint-1024x291.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Summary</strong><br /> With support for Auto Scaling in AWS Config, you can track configuration changes to your Auto Scaling groups and associated resource types. You can use the pre-built AWS Config rule or you can create custom rules to scan the configuration of these resources and verify compliance with best practices, internal guidelines, and regulatory requirements.</p>

<p>Recently, AWS Config announced support for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/">Classic Load Balancer</a> in all public regions and AWS GovCloud (US). You can now start tracking the current and historical configurations of your Classic Load Balancers, and get notified via&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns/">Amazon SNS</a> when your configurations change. You can also use three new managed AWS Config rules to verify whether your Classic Load Balancers are using SSL certificates provided by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/">AWS Certificate Manager</a>, and whether the SSL listeners are using specific policies.</p> 
<p>Tracking configuration changes to your Classic Load Balancers is valuable from an operations perspective. You can use AWS Config to troubleshoot common operational issues with your Classic Load Balancers such as health check failures, connectivity issues, sticky session failures, SSL certificate issues, etc.</p> 
<p>In this post, I walk you through two possible use cases:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Monitoring your Classic Load Balancer for configuration changes (two parts)</li> 
<li>Verifying whether the SSL certificate installed on your Classic Load Balancer is provided by AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).</li> 
</ol> 
<p><span id="more-1471"></span></p> 
<b>AWS services</b> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/config/">AWS Config</a> enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. It continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against the configurations you want. With AWS Config, you can review changes in configurations and relationships between AWS resources, dive into detailed resource configuration histories, and determine your overall compliance against the configurations specified in your internal guidelines.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/">Elastic Load Balancing</a> offers two types of load balancers that both feature high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security. These include the Classic Load Balancer that routes traffic based on either application or network level information, and the Application Load Balancer that routes traffic based on advanced application-level information that includes the content of the request. The Classic Load Balancer is ideal for simple load balancing of traffic across multiple EC2 instances.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/">AWS Certificate Manager</a> is a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for use with AWS services such as Elastic Load Balancing.</p> 
<b>Use case: Monitoring a Classic Load Balancer for configuration changes (Part 1)</b> 
<p>Your customers are reporting connectivity issues to your Classic Load Balancer. Here’s how you can use AWS Config to quickly identify the issues and minimize production downtime.</p> 
<p>For this example, a Classic Load Balancer is created with the following health check parameters and listener configurations:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/02/08/Picture1-3.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/02/08/Picture2-1.png" /></p> 
<p>In this configuration, your application is running on HTTP port 80. Now, imagine that someone accidentally updates the load balancer and sets the health check and listener ports to 8080. Because the application is not listening on port 8080, the health check fails and the EC2 instances behind the load balancer become unhealthy. Also, there would be connectivity issues because the load balancer is no longer listening on port 80. Until both of these changes are reverted, there would be an impact on production traffic.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/02/08/Picture3.png" /></p> 
<p>AWS Config helps you troubleshoot these types of issues.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Log in to the AWS Config console.</li> 
<li>For <strong>Resources</strong>, choose <strong>ElasticLoadBalancing:LoadBalancer</strong>.</li> 
<li>Choose <strong>Look up</strong> to see the list of Classic Load Balancers that AWS Config has automatically discovered in your account.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>The following screenshot shows an example Classic Load Balancer on the Resource inventory page:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/02/08/Picture4.png" /></p> 
<p>Look at the Config timeline for the <strong>ProductionLB</strong>. The following screenshot shows the timeline and configuration details:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/02/08/Picture5.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>At the top, you see a timeline of all changes that have occurred to the load balancer after creation.</p> 
<p>You can see the configuration of the load balancer under <strong>Configuration Details</strong>. This includes the <strong>Amazon Resource Name (ARN), Resource ID, DNS name, </strong>and<strong> Listeners</strong>.</p> 
<p>In this scenario, there were <strong>3 changes</strong> on <strong>September 8th </strong>at<strong> 07:01:36 PM</strong>. You can drill down further to see what those changes were. The load balancer health check and listener ports were changed to 8080.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2017/10/10/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-7.07.23-PM.png" />AWS Config also sends an SNS notification each time that a configuration change is detected, so that you can be alerted of changes to your Classic Load Balancers.</p> 
<b>Use case: Monitoring a Classic Load Balancer for configuration changes (Part 2)</b> 
<p>Your customers intermittently observe blank pages on your website. The session information is stored in the application running on the EC2 instances behind the load balancer. For this reason, you have enabled session stickiness on your load balancer, as seen in the following screenshot:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/02/08/Picture7.png" /></p> 
<p>If someone accidentally disables the cross-zone load balancing, the load balancer would not forward requests to EC2 instances across Availability Zones. This breaks the session stickiness for your application and your customers observe intermittent blank pages on your website.</p> 
<p>You can track the configuration changes to your load balancer using AWS Config, as explained in the previous example. In this case, AWS Config shows that cross-zone load balancing was disabled. You can enable it again to fix the issue.</p> 
<b>Use case: Verifying the SSL certificate installed on a Classic Load Balancer</b> 
<p>In addition to tracking the configuration changes on your Classic Load Balancers, you can use AWS Config rules to check your Classic Load Balancers against best practices and internal policies.</p> 
<p>For example, you can use the prebuilt rule <strong>elb-acm-certificate-required</strong> to verify whether your Classic Load Balancers are using SSL certificates provided by ACM.</p> 
<p><strong>Note</strong>: ACM makes it easier to enable SSL/TLS for a website or application on AWS. ACM eliminates many of the manual processes previously associated with using SSL/TLS and managing SSL/TLS certificates. ACM can also help you avoid downtime due to misconfigured, revoked, or expired certificates by managing renewals. You get SSL/TLS protection and easy certificate management.</p> 
<p>The following illustration shows compliant and noncompliant states for this rule. The Classic Load Balancer that you created earlier is showing as noncompliant with this rule because it doesn’t have an SSL certificate installed using ACM.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/02/08/Picture8.png" /></p> 
<p>After installing an SSL certificate provided by ACM, you can see that the compliance status changes to the compliant state.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/02/08/Picture9.png" /></p> 
<b>Additional AWS Config rules</b> 
<p>In addition to the managed Config rule described above, you can use the <strong>elb-predefined-security-policy-ssl-check</strong> and <strong>elb-custom-security-policy-ssl-check</strong> rules to verify that the SSL listeners on the Classic Load Balancer are using specific custom or predefined policies.</p> 
<b>Summary</b> 
<p>With support for Classic Load Balancers in AWS Config, you can now continuously track configuration changes such as health check parameters, listener configuration changes, sticky session configuration changes, and cross-zone load balancing. You can then use managed Config rules to evaluate these configuration changes against your desired configuration and verify your compliance with best practices.</p>

<p>It’s been another exciting year for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/config/">AWS Config</a>, a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. We have expanded our regional availability, added support for new resource types, introduced new managed Config rules, and introduced a dashboard view of your resource configuration and compliance. In this post, I recap some of this year’s announcements and provide links to additional resources.</p> 
<p><strong>Regional expansion:</strong> With the addition of the South America (S&atilde;o Paulo), Canada (Central), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), and Europe (London) Regions, AWS Config now supports Config rules in all 17 public AWS Regions and in AWS GovCloud (US). For the complete list of regions where Config and Config rules are available, see the AWS Config section under <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#awsconfig_region">AWS Regions and Endpoints</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>New resource types:</strong> We have added support for eight new services in 2017. You can now record configuration changes from the following:</p> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/07/aws-config-tracks-changes-to-aws-cloudformation-stacks/">AWS CloudFormation</a></li>

<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/06/aws-config-supports-amazon-cloudwatch-alarms-and-additional-rule/">Amazon CloudWatch</a></li> 
<p><strong>New managed rules:</strong> AWS Config allows you to enable rules to evaluate whether your AWS resources comply with common best practices. In 2017, we added support for nine new rules, bringing the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html">total to 47</a>. Two of the rules that we announced during the AWS NY Summit allow you to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/example-scenarios-for-aws-config-continuous-monitoring-of-amazon-s3-bucket-access-controls/">secure your Amazon S3 buckets</a>. The rules check your S3 buckets for unrestricted public write access or unrestricted public read access. They are backed by a new semantic-based automated reasoning engine, which returns a compliance decision.</p> 
<p><strong>Notable features:</strong> In 2017, we released <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/02/aws-config-rules-adds-aws-cloudformation-templates-and-a-test-mode-for-rule-authoring/">ready-to-use AWS CloudFormation templates</a> for all managed rules and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/02/aws-config-rules-adds-aws-cloudformation-templates-and-a-test-mode-for-rule-authoring/">added support for a test mode</a> to check the functionality of custom Config rules. Using the test mode, you can safely check whether your custom Config rules are correctly reporting evaluation results for your resources without sending evaluation results to Config and incurring charges.</p> 
<p>We also <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/07/introducing-aws-config-dashboard/">introduced an AWS Config dashboard</a> that allows you to view the total number of resources being recorded in your account and the count of resources by type to easily access the configuration history of a resource. With a Config dashboard, you can also quickly spot the number of resources that are non-compliant with your Config rules in each region, view the Config rules with the most non-compliant resources, and drill down to view the resources that are non-compliant with a particular Config rule.</p>

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3> 
<p>Many AWS customers, particularly in the public sector, are implementing a central IT agency model. These organizations have an AWS account for central IT that is designated for the management of security and compliance activities such as patch management, use of golden Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), and federates user access for other agencies’ AWS accounts.</p> 
<p>In this blog post, I present a solution that will allow the AWS account for central IT to use AWS Systems Manager (SSM) to execute commands using Run Command and manage patches in the AWS accounts of other agencies. I’ll walk you through the steps for deploying this solution using AWS CloudFormation templates. We will create a Systems Manager Activation in the central account for registering Amazon EC2 instances as managed instances from the other agencies’ AWS accounts. We’ll also deploy AWS Lambda functions to propagate the EC2 tags into the Central IT account and attach them to the managed instances as Systems Manager tags. This way the tags can be used as targets for executing SSM Documents through Run Commands and for other Systems Manager features such as State Manager, Maintenance Windows, and Patch Management.</p> 
<p><span id="more-2227"></span></p> 
<p>These are the minimum requirements for implementing this solution:<br /> • Central IT account (or a parent account)<br /> • Agency account (or child accounts)<br /> • EC2 instance profile in the agency account<br /> • SSM agents and Boto3 library on EC2 instances</p> 
<p>The following diagram shows the system architecture:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2017/12/27/Blog_ssm_diag.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3><strong>Implementation </strong></h3> 
<p><strong>Step one</strong><br /> First, we’ll create a managed instance activation in the central IT AWS account. This activation will be used to register both Windows and Linux EC2 instances from individual agency accounts. On activation creation, an activation ID along with activation code is returned. You need to store these in a text file, we’ll use them in later steps.</p> 
<p>For this blog post I’m providing a Python script for registering Amazon Linux-based EC2 instances from the agency account. You can easily write your own script for Windows or other operating system (OS) platforms.</p> 
<p><strong>Step two</strong><br /> Next, we’ll deploy SSM Agent on EC2 instances in all of the agency/child accounts that will be centrally managed through the activation created in the first step. Note that by default the EC2 instance registers to its own account’s Systems Manager after the agent is installed and started. The EC2 instance appears in the Systems Manager Shared Resources section in the appropriate AWS Region, in the Managed Instances tab.</p> 
<p><strong>Step three</strong><br /> Now we’ll create two parameters, ActivationID and ActivationCode, in the agency’s Systems Manager Parameter Store for the values we already have copied in a text file in step one. Our Python script that registers the EC2 instance to activation uses the values of these parameters for registration. You can use either the AWS Management Console, the API, or AWS CLI for creating the parameters. For the AWS CLI, use the following commands, which are documented in the&nbsp;CLI Command Reference.</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">aws ssm put-parameter --name &quot;ActivationID&quot; --type &quot;String&quot; --value &quot;xxxxxxxxxx&quot; --region &lt;AWS_region&gt;
aws ssm put-parameter --name &quot;ActivationCode&quot; --type &quot;String&quot; --value &quot;xxxxxxxxx&quot; --region &lt;AWS_region&gt;
</code> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Step four</strong><br /> After the SSM Agent is installed, the EC2 instances need to be registered to the activation that we created in the first step. When the registration to an activation is complete, a managed instance ID is returned in the form mi-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx. This ID is attached to the instance since neither EC2 instance ID nor the EC2 tags are propagated to the Central IT account from the agency account through activation. We’ll use Lambda functions later to propagate all of the EC2 tags to the Central IT account from each agency account.</p> 
<p>The Python code that follows registers an Amazon Linux-based EC2 instance to an unexpired activation. The code requires the Boto 3 library to be pre-installed on the instance and an EC2 instance profile that has permissions to access Systems Manager Parameter Store and create EC2 tags.</p>

<p>Learn more about activation for different operating systems:</p> 
<li>Registering Windows instances to activation: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managedinstances.html#sysman-install-managed-win">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managedinstances.html#sysman-install-managed-win</a></li> 
<li>Registering Linux instances to activation:<br /> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managedinstances.html#sysman-install-managed-linux">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managedinstances.html#sysman-install-managed-linux</a></li> 
<p>Note that there is a limit of 1,000 instances per activation and activation expires after a maximum of 30 days. After activation expiry, new instances can’t be registered to it, but registered instances can continue to be managed.</p> 
<p><strong>Step five</strong><br /> After they are registered, the EC2 Instances in other accounts will appear in the EC2 console, in the Central IT account, Managed Instances section. They are identified by the same managed ID that was returned during activation process. This returned Managed ID is attached as an EC2 tag in the earlier Python code. A Lambda function, called Automation-EC2-Tags-Collector, copies the EC2 tags in the agency account to the Central IT account by invoking a second Lambda function, called Automation-SSM-Tag-Manager. The following CloudFormation template will deploy this Lambda function in agency accounts:</p> 
<p><a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/new?stackName=Automation-EC2-Tags-Collector&amp;templateURL=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/management-tools-blog-cf-template-storage/SSM/aws-automation-ec2-tag-collector.yaml"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2017/10/31/blog_westrich_5.png" /></a></p> 
<p>The Automation-SSM-Tag-Manager Lambda function is deployed in the Central IT account so that it can accept the EC2 tags passed as an event by each agency’s Lambda function. Since each of the EC2 tags has the managed instance ID tag as well, it can used to map all the relevant EC2 tags propagated from agency accounts to the managed instances in in the central account. A maximum of 10 tags can be attached to a managed instance. Tags are critical to Systems Manager operation because they group resources together for applying and deploying Systems Manager functionalities such as Run Command, State Manager, Patch Manager, and Maintenance Windows.</p> 
<p>Use the following CloudFormation template to deploy Automation-SSM-Tag-Manager Central IT account:</p> 
<p><a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/new?stackName=Automation-SSM-Tag-Manager&amp;templateURL=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/management-tools-blog-cf-template-storage/SSM/aws-automation-ssm-tag-manager.yaml"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2017/10/31/blog_westrich_5.png" /></a></p> 
<p>The Automation-EC2-Tags-Collector Lambda function should have permissions to invoke Automation-SSM-Tag-Manager. We’ll ensure this by deploying the following CloudFormation template. For parameters for adding permissions, you need to provide the agency account ID and the AWS Region into which the Automation-EC2-Tags-Collector is deployed.</p> 
<p><a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/new? stackName=AWS-Automation-SSM-Add-Agency&amp;templateURL=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/management-tools-blog-cf-template-storage/SSM/aws-automation-ssm-add-agency.yaml"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2017/10/31/blog_westrich_5.png" /></a></p> 
<p><strong>Step six</strong><br /> After these CloudFormation templates are successfully deployed, you need to validate the instances appearing as managed instances in the central IT account along with the EC2 tags. Execute following AWS CLI command for the central IT account:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">aws ssm list-tags-for-resource --resource-type “ManagedInstance” --resource-id &quot;&lt;managedinstanceID&gt;&quot; --region &lt;Activation_region&gt;
</code> 
<p>You can now use the propagated tags to execute Systems Manager documents or create Maintenance Windows. As an example you can execute the following Run Command on EC2 tag of “OS=Linux” as under:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">aws ssm send-command --document-name &quot;AWS-RunShellScript&quot; –parameters commands=[&quot;ifconfig&quot;] --targets Key=tag:OS,Values=Linux --region &lt;your_SSM_region&gt;
</code> 
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3> 
<p>In this blog post I presented a Central IT solution for cross-account and cross-platform EC2 management using AWS Systems Manager and AWS Lambda. We created an Activation in the central IT account for registering agencies’ EC2 instances, we then deployed Lambda functions to import EC2 tags into the Central IT account for using them in implementing various EC2 SSM features. Using Systems Manager in Central IT provides you a variety of out-of-the-box features such as Patch Management, Maintenance Windows, Automation, and State Manager. These features can be used to enforce compliance and governance. Deploying this solution not only allows you to manage instances centrally but also to keep managing various OS platforms independently using the exported EC2 tags.</p>

<p>In 2017, over 350,000 AWS customers used <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation">AWS CloudFormation</a> to manage resources collected across 2.4M stacks. We added coverage for 14 new services and several new features.</p> 
<p>In this post, I’d like to look back at some features and new content that CloudFormation introduced in 2017, including:</p> 
<ul class="incremental"> 
<li>New AWS resources that you can provision with CloudFormation.</li> 
<li>StackSets to centrally manage stacks across accounts and regions.</li> 
<li>Termination protection to protect stacks that contain critical resources.</li> 
<li>Rollback triggers to revert infrastructure changes impacting application performance.</li> 
<li>Integration with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager">AWS Systems Manager</a> Parameter Store.</li> 
<li>Quick-create links to get stacks up and running quickly.</li> 
<li>…and some of our most popular posts and re:Invent sessions.</li> 
<p>I also talk a little about what’s ahead in 2018.<span id="more-2521"></span></p> 
<h3 id="new-aws-resources">New AWS resources</h3> 
<p>I did some digging into the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-resource-specification.html">AWS CloudFormation Resource Specification</a> and pulled out a few interesting statistics.</p> 
<p>In 2017, we added support for 14 new services and APIs in CloudFormation:</p> 
<table style="height: 203px" width="775"> 
<tbody> 
<tr> 
<td>Amazon Athena</td> 
<td>AWS Glue</td> 
</tr> 
<tr> 
<td>AWS Batch</td> 
<td>Amazon GuardDuty</td> 
</tr> 
<tr> 
<td>AWS Cloud9</td> 
<td>Amazon Inspector</td> 
</tr> 
<tr> 
<td>AWS CodeStar</td> 
<td>Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics</td> 
</tr> 
<tr> 
<td>Amazon Cognito</td> 
<td>Amazon Route 53 Auto Naming API</td>

<tr> 
<td>AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)</td> 
<td>AWS Step Functions</td> 
</tr> 
<tr> 
<td>Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)</td> 
<td>AWS WAF Regional</td> 
</tr> 
</tbody> 
</table> 
<p>As of today, you can use CloudFormation to provision 248 AWS resource types, 71 more than this time last year. For information about supported resources, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html">AWS Resource Types Reference</a> in the <em>AWS CloudFormation User Guide</em> or grab the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-resource-specification.html">AWS CloudFormation Resource Specification</a> yourself for the canonical list.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/01/31/Screen-Shot-2018-01-31-at-12.00.15-PM.png" /></p> 
<p>You can read up on some of these new features and service in a series of coverage posts that my colleague, Luis Colon, has been writing. For instance, here’s one walking you through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/aws-cloudformation-features-update-support-for-amazon-athena-coverage-updates-for-s3-rds-kinesis-and-cloudwatch/">creating a named query resource for Amazon Athena</a>.</p> 
<h3 id="stacksets">StackSets</h3> 
<p>With CloudFormation StackSets, you can now define AWS resources in a CloudFormation template and then roll it out across multiple AWS accounts or Regions in an automated and repeatable manner. You can use this to set up a baseline level of AWS functionality that addresses cross-account and cross-region infrastructure management.</p> 
<p>Jeff Barr walked you through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/use-cloudformation-stacksets-to-provision-resources-across-multiple-aws-accounts-and-regions/">using StackSets</a> in a post on the AWS Blog.</p> 
<h3 id="termination-protection">Termination protection</h3> 
<p>Enabling termination protection on a stack prevents it from being accidentally deleted. You cannot delete a stack with termination protection enabled. We walked you through turning on this feature in our post on how to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/use-aws-cloudformation-stack-termination-protection-and-rollback-triggers-to-maintain-infrastructure-availability/">Use AWS CloudFormation Stack Termination Protection and Rollback Triggers to Maintain Infrastructure Availability</a>. We also discussed incorporating this feature into a strategy for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/aws-cloudformation-guardrails-protecting-your-stacks-and-ensuring-safer-updates/">AWS CloudFormation Guardrails: Protecting your Stacks and Ensuring Safer Updates</a>.</p> 
<h3 id="rollback-triggers">Rollback triggers</h3> 
<p>Rollback triggers enable you to have CloudFormation monitor the state of your application during stack creation and updates. CloudFormation rolls back that operation if the application breaches the threshold of any of the alarms that you’ve specified.</p> 
<p>There’s a walkthrough of setting up a rollback trigger in the second half of my post, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/use-aws-cloudformation-stack-termination-protection-and-rollback-triggers-to-maintain-infrastructure-availability/">Use AWS CloudFormation Stack Termination Protection and Rollback Triggers to Maintain Infrastructure Availability</a>.</p> 
<h3 id="systems-manager-parameter-store-integration">Systems Manager Parameter Store integration</h3> 
<p>You can now reference Systems Manager parameters in the Parameters section of your CloudFormation templates to simplify stack updates and achieve consistency by using values from Parameter Store.</p> 
<p>We published a post to walk you through the process of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/integrating-aws-cloudformation-with-aws-systems-manager-parameter-store/">Integrating AWS CloudFormation with AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store</a>.</p> 
<h3 id="quick-create-links-to-get-stacks-up-and-running-quickly.">Quick-create links to get stacks up and running quickly.</h3> 
<p>Finally, you can now build quick-create links pre-populated with the template URL, stack name, and template parameters. To try it out yourself, check out <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-stacks-quick-create-links.html">Creating Quick-Create Links for Stacks</a>.</p> 
<h3 id="blog-posts-and-reinvent-sessions">Blog posts and re:Invent sessions</h3> 
<p>The most-read CloudFormation post from the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/">AWS Management Tools blog</a> in 2017 was <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/configuring-serverless-applications-using-aws-cloudformation-custom-resources/">Configuring Serverless applications using CloudFormation Custom Resources</a>. Posts on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/use-aws-cloudformation-stack-termination-protection-and-rollback-triggers-to-maintain-infrastructure-availability/">Stack Termination</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/integrating-aws-cloudformation-with-aws-systems-manager-parameter-store/">Parameter Store integration</a> were also popular.</p> 
<p>At re:Invent, there were 67 sessions at least partially dealing with CloudFormation. The <a href="https://youtu.be/01hy48R9Kr8">CloudFormation Deep Dive (DEV317)</a> session was popular enough to get a repeat session. Other sessions included:</p> 
<ul class="incremental"> 
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKd7WeCLJaM">Learn How Intuit Built a Frictionless Infrastructure Management (DEV318)</a></li> 
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBvsizhKtFk">AWS re:Invent 2017: How Amazon.com Uses AWS Management Tools (DEV340)</a></li> 
<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next</h3> 
<p>The AWS CloudFormation team looks forward to making more improvements to your CloudFormation experience in 2018, starting with the new Drift Detection feature that we announced at re:Invent and which is currently in beta.</p> 
<p>And remember, you can always go to the documentation <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/ReleaseHistory.html">CloudFormation release history page</a> to see the latest updates.</p>

<p>Many organizations have predictable spikes in the usage of their applications and services. For example, retailers see large spikes in usage during Black Friday or Cyber Monday. The beauty of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is that it allows customers to quickly scale up their compute power to meet these demands. However, some customers might require more time-consuming setup for their software running on EC2 instances. Instead of creating and terminating instances to meet demand, these customers turn off instances and then turn them on again when they are needed. Eventually the patches on those instances become out of date, and they require updates.</p> 
<p>In this blog, I cover how to leverage AWS Step Functions and AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows to start an EC2 instance, apply any outstanding patches using Patch Manager, then stop the EC2 instance. I also cover the necessary steps to manage these resources using AWS CloudFormation. A Maintenance Window lets you define a schedule for when to perform potentially disruptive actions on your instances, such as patching an operating system (OS), updating drivers, or installing software. Each Maintenance Window has a schedule, a duration, a set of registered targets, and a set of registered tasks. AWS Step Functions are part of the AWS Serverless Platform. They make it simple to orchestrate AWS Lambda functions for serverless applications. Finally, CloudFormation gives developers and systems administrators an easy way to create and manage a collection of related AWS resources, provisioning and updating them in an orderly and predictable fashion.</p> 
<p><span id="more-2436"></span></p> 
<p><strong>Availability</strong></p> 
<p>Although AWS Systems Manager is currently available in all AWS Regions, CloudFormation support for Systems Manager is only available in some Regions. For a list of available Regions, please check the CloudFormationResourceSpecification.json for a given Region, which can be seen <a title="undefined" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-resource-specification.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Similarly, Step Functions are only available in some Regions as well. The list of available Regions can be seen <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>Setup</strong></p> 
<p>CloudFormation works on your behalf to manage AWS resources. The CloudFormation template for this post, which outlines the resources that will be provisioned into an AWS CloudFormation stack, can be run as-is, there is no additional setup required to get started. The template creates the following resources:</p> 
<li>An EC2 instance 
<li>The instance we are going to patch</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li>A Systems Manager Maintenance Window 
<li>A Maintenance Window representing a timeframe in which to run our patching operation</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li>A Systems Manager Maintenance Window target 
<li>A target on which the task will act, in this case it will be our EC2 instance</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li>A Systems Manager Maintenance Window task 
<li>The task that we want to execute, in this case an AWS Step Function</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li>A series of AWS Lambda functions 
<li>One Lambda function for each of the following actions: start, stop, patch, and poll our instance as well as poll the patching activity</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li>An AWS Step Function 
<li>Manages the workflow of the Lambda Functions</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li>IAM roles 
<li>Give proper access to all of the above mentioned resources</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<p>Here is a link (<a title="undefined" href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/management-tools-blog-cf-template-storage/InstancePatchingWithSSMTemplate.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSON</a>)/(<a title="undefined" href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/management-tools-blog-cf-template-storage/InstancePatchingWithSSMTemplate.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YAML</a>) to the sample template. I will walk through each piece of the template step-by-step. I’ll discuss some of the common issues to look out for when trying to run this template on your own account.</p> 
<h3><strong>CloudFormation template walkthrough</strong></h3> 
<p><strong>IAM roles</strong></p> 
<p>A Maintenance Window executes a set of tasks on a schedule without requiring user interaction through the AWS Management Console or the AWS SDK/CLI. For this blog post, the task will be a Step Function. The Maintenance Window will require an IAM role that grants it the appropriate permissions to execute the Step Function. Also, the Lambda functions and Step Function require their own roles based on the resources they are accessing. These are the IAM roles created for this blog post:</p> 
<li>InstanceStateActionRoleForLambda 
<li>The InstanceStateActionRoleForLambda provides the necessary access to allow the Starter, Stopper, and InstancePoller Lambda functions to call an EC2 instance.</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li>InstancePatchingRoleForLambda 
<li>The InstancePatchingRoleForLambda provides the necessary access to allow the Patcher and PatchPoller Lambda functions to call Systems Manager.</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li>StepFunctionRole 
<li>The StepFunctionRole allows your Step Function to call each of the Lambda functions.</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<p><strong>Lambda functions</strong></p> 
<p>Here is a list and short description of the Lambda functions created for this blog post:</p> 
<li>InstancePatcherLambda 
<li>Uses AWS Systems Manager&nbsp;Patch Manager&nbsp;to&nbsp;scan and install any patches based on the Patch Baseline that applies to the instance (the Patch Baseline associated with the instance’s Patch Group, if defined, otherwise the default Patch Baseline for the instance’s operating system).</li>

<p><strong>Step Function</strong></p> 
<p>The Step Function organizes each of the Lambda functions into a workflow. The steps are laid out in a specific order, which reliably coordinates each component and steps through the workflow of the application. Also, in the Step Functions console, you can watch the Step Function operate and see each step as it moves through the workflow.</p> 
<p><strong>Maintenance Window</strong></p> 
<p>To set up a Maintenance Window using CloudFormation, you need three resources, and they must be created in the following order: a Maintenance Window, a Maintenance Window target, and a Maintenance Window task. The DependsOn attribute of CloudFormation allows us to order the creation of our resources. In the provided template, you can see that each of the Maintenance Window resources uses DependsOn to ensure this ordering. See the following excerpt:</p> 
<p><code class="language-yaml">MaintenanceWindow:<br /> Type: 'AWS::SSM::MaintenanceWindow'<br /> Properties:<br /> Name: 'LambdaMW'<br /> AllowUnassociatedTargets: 'true'<br /> Schedule: 'rate(30 minutes)'<br /> Duration: '2'<br /> Cutoff: '1'<br /> DependsOn: TestInstance<br /> </code></p> 
<p><strong>AMIInfo/AMIInfoFunction</strong></p> 
<p>These two resources are used only for convenience, they perform a lookup that generates the AMI-ID for the EC2 instance that we create in the stack. For more information <a title="undefined" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/walkthrough-custom-resources-lambda-lookup-amiids.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see the documentation</a>.</p> 
<h3><strong>Activity walkthrough</strong></h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Create the CloudFormation stack</strong></p> 
<p>Follow these steps to create the CloudFormation stack for this walkthrough.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Open the <strong>AWS CloudFormation</strong> console at <a title="undefined" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation</a>.</li> 
<li>Choose <strong>Create Stack</strong>.</li> 
<li>On the <strong>Select Template</strong> page, choose <strong>Specify an Amazon S3 template URL</strong> and give the following S3 URL: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/management-tools-blog-cf-template-storage/InstancePatchingWithSSMTemplate.yaml.</li> 
<li>For <strong>Stack Name</strong>, give an appropriate name, choose <strong>Next</strong>.</li> 
<li>On the <strong>Options</strong> page, choose <strong>Next</strong>.</li> 
<li>On the <strong>Review</strong> page, select <strong>I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources with custom names</strong> and choose <strong>Create</strong>.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>You can view the progress of CloudFormation progress by selecting your stack and choosing the <strong>Events</strong> tab. Once CloudFormation has built each resource, it will show <em>CREATE_COMPLETE</em> as the Status for the stack.</p> 
<p>Follow these steps to view the Maintenance Window created in this walkthrough.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Open the <strong>AWS Systems Manager</strong> console at <a title="undefined" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager</a>.</li> 
<li>Navigate to <strong>Explore Maintenance Windows</strong>.</li> 
<li>Choose the Maintenance Window named <em>SSMStepFunctionDemo</em>.</li> 
<li>Choose the <strong>View Details</strong> button.</li> 
<li>Choose the <strong>History</strong> tab.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>It is possible that on the first Maintenance Window execution you might see a status message stating that there were no tasks to execute. This happens because the Maintenance Window is set to run every 30 minutes. When it gets created, it attempts to run immediately, but since there is no task associated with it, the execution returns Success with the above status. The schedule of a Maintenance Window can be in the form of a <a title="undefined" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/ScheduledEvents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cron or rate expression</a> and since our Maintenance Window uses a rate expression, it will not run again for another 30 minutes. This issue also occurs for cron expressions that run in explicit intervals, for example <em>cron(0/15 * * * ? *)</em>. We can restart it by disabling and re-enabling the Maintenance Window.</p> 
<p>Here are the steps for restarting a Maintenance Window created in this walkthrough.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Choose the Maintenance Window you want to restart.</li> 
<li>Choose <strong>Actions</strong> then choose <strong>Disable maintenance window</strong>.</li> 
<li>Choose <strong>Actions</strong> again then choose <strong>Enable maintenance window</strong>.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Here are the steps for viewing the Step Function created in this walkthrough.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Open the <strong>AWS CloudFormation</strong> console at <a title="undefined" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation</a>.</li> 
<li>Choose the <strong>CloudFormation</strong> stack created previously.</li> 
<li>Select the <strong>Resources</strong> tab, search for the <strong>StateMachine</strong> created by <strong>CloudFormation</strong>. Take note of the name of the StateMachine, it will look something like this <em>SSMStepFunctionDemo-YCIADKH4IGYU</em>.</li> 
<li>Open the <strong>AWS State Machine</strong> console at <a title="undefined" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/states" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://console.aws.amazon.com/states</a>.</li> 
<li>Choose the <strong>StateMachine</strong> with the name from <strong>step #3</strong>.</li> 
<li>Under the list of executions for the <strong>StateMachine</strong> find the currently running execution, then click on the link for that execution in the <strong>Name</strong> column.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>You can now watch as the Step Function executes each of the Lambda functions created through CloudFormation. Note that the actual updating of the patches can take some time, at least 10 to 15 minutes.</p> 
<p><strong>Viewing patching results</strong></p> 
<p>Now that the execution of the Step Function is complete, we can view the results of the Patching activity.</p> 
<p>Here are the steps to view the Maintenance Window patching results:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Open the <strong>StateMachine</strong> execution from the previous step.</li> 
<li>Under the <strong>Visual Workflow</strong> tab, Choose the step labeled Patch Instance.</li> 
<li>Under <strong>Execution Details</strong> on the right, Choose the Output tab.</li> 
<li>Copy the value of <strong>commandId</strong>.</li> 
<li>Open the <strong>AWS Systems Manager</strong> console at <a title="undefined" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager</a>.</li> 
<li>Choose <strong>Explore Run Command</strong>.</li> 
<li>Choose the search bar at the top of the table to add a filter.</li> 
<li>Select <strong>Command Id</strong> as the filter and paste in the Command Id you copied from step #4.</li> 
<li>Select the <strong>Command</strong>.</li> 
<li>In the <strong>Output</strong> tab at the bottom,&nbsp;click <strong>View Output</strong>.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>The output will display various pieces of information including which patches were installed, the snapshot ID for the patching snapshot, and the patch baseline used.</p> 
<p><strong>Verifying that the instance has stopped</strong></p> 
<p>After the execution of the Step Function is complete, it will stop the instance. We can see this by viewing the instance in the EC2 console.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Open the <strong>EC2</strong> console at <a title="undefined" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2</a>.</li> 
<li>Choose the <strong>Instances</strong> link under the <strong>Instances</strong> tab on the left.</li> 
<li>Find the <strong>EC2 instance</strong> with the Name <em>ssm-stepfunction-demo</em>.</li> 
</ol> 
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3> 
<p>In this post, I have shown you how to use CloudFormation to create a Maintenance Window that executes a Step Function, which&nbsp;uses Patch Manager to patch&nbsp;long running instances that we don’t want to keep on at all times. You can use CloudFormation to easily deploy Maintenance Windows across multiple Regions to ensure that resources are properly patched and that the states of your resources are as you expect. This also greatly reduces the burden of keeping Maintenance Windows in sync across Regions, guaranteeing that the Maintenance Windows are all operating in the same manner.</p>

<p>The AWS CloudFormation team has been busy in the last couple of months, adding support for new resource types for recently released AWS services. In this post, I take a deep dive into using AWS Glue with CloudFormation.</p> 
<p><strong>About AWS Glue</strong></p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glue/">AWS Glue</a> was first announced at re:Invent in 2016, and was made generally available in August 2017. AWS Glue is a serverless extract, transform and load (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">ETL</a>) service. ETL is a critical step in operationalizing data analytics, since data cleansing and reformatting is almost always necessary when creating everything from data marts, warehouses, data lakes, machine learning algorithms, metrics dashboards, operational reports, and many other data science projects.</p> 
<p>Data science projects can be very time-consuming from an experimentation and discovery perspective. When a promising candidate project emerges, implementing the necessary production compute and storage resources can cause significant delays. It’s necessary that the business leverage the resources in a repeatable and ongoing basis.</p> 
<p><strong>Analyzing historical price data for bitcoin: Planning</strong></p> 
<p>Your company wants to pursue a new service relating to cryptocurrency analysis, and your IT team gets asked to produce a database with historical price information for bitcoin, to feed other analysis processes. Rather than require a significant upfront investment in building the database and the necessary tooling for ongoing analysis and model development, you can leverage AWS Glue and open source development tools like <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a>, Python and <a href="https://zeppelin.apache.org/">Apache Zeppelin</a> to enable quick experimentation and further product development. Further, you want to automate the operationalization of this data analysis platform as quickly as possible, and AWS CloudFormation helps with this automation.</p> 
<p><span id="more-2555"></span></p> 
<p>Start with getting historical bitcoin price data. You can choose to consume the data directly from currency exchanges, or you can find an existing dataset that includes past data. There are many sources of public data sets for such projects, as outlined in 18 places to find data sets for data science projects. One of my favorite sources for such data sets is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>, where you can also learn from other scientists’ projects and findings, as well as participate in data science competitions sponsored by companies and academic institutions.</p> 
<p>The dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data">from the Bitcoin Historical Data</a> page will fit our needs (see Figure 1 below); it includes historical data from January 2012 to today, from several exchanges.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/01/29/datasample.png" /></p> 
<p><strong>Figure 1. A sample of the CSV data provided for the coinbase exchange.</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Setting up our Bitcoin Price Database</strong></p> 
<ol> 
<li>If you’ve never used Kaggle, you are asked to set up a free account.</li> 
<li>Download the data as a zip file from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data">Bitcoin Historical Data</a>.</li> 
<li>Expand the zip file locally and locate the file for the coinbase exchange.</li> 
<li>Set up an Amazon S3 bucket and put the file there.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Armed with this data, now get the data to a point that you can inspect it, query it, and plan for further development and experiments.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Create a new file in your favorite editor.</li> 
<li>Copy and paste the following CloudFormation template into the file (see Figure 2 below).</li> 
<li>Save it, and create a new stack with the console (I used the US East N. Virginia region), the CLI, or the API.</li> 
</ol>

<p><strong>Figure 2. The CloudFormation template for the AWS Glue crawler from bitcoin data.</strong></p> 
<p>You set up everything with CloudFormation early in the process, so eventually operationalizing the solution in a production environment becomes fast and repeatable.&nbsp;The template helps you:</p> 
<li>Designate S3 as the storage data lake</li> 
<li>Create an IAM role to use AWS Glue</li> 
<li>Extract the data</li> 
<li>Create a database</li> 
<li>Load the data into a table that you can query with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/athena/">Amazon Athena</a> or later visualize with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/">Amazon QuickSight</a>.</li> 
<p>Note the following from the template code:</p> 
<li>The template creates the minimal resources for setting up your database. This include the IAM role (<em>ETLRole</em> in the code example), the database itself, which can be used in Athena or QuickSight for further analysis, and the crawler. The crawler does the work of extracting the data from the CSV file that you downloaded and populates the table in the database.</li> 
<li>When creating the database (<em>BitcoinPriceDB</em> in the code example), ensure that you only use lowercase characters in the string for the Database Input/Name attribute (<em>bitcoin-price-db</em>, in the code example).</li> 
<li>For the crawler, specify your bucket in the Targets/S3Targets/Path attribute (<em>s3://cfnda-bitcoin-historical-data/</em>coinbase in the code example). Put your own bucket and folder path where you uploaded your copy of the coinbase file that you got from Kaggle in the previous steps.</li> 
<li>For this example, the template sets up a schedule for the crawler to run every five minutes on weekdays. For your experiment, you may either omit the Schedule/ScheduleExpression stanza and run the crawler manually from the AWS Glue console, or use your own cron expression (see some examples in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/monitor-data-warehouse-schedule.html">Time-Based Schedules for Jobs and Crawlers</a>,keeping in mind that you are charged per the rates on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/">AWS Glue Pricing</a>).</li> 
<li>For this quick example, it makes sense to put everything in one template, with the benefit of quickly deleting all resources by deleting the stack. For a long-term project, you may want to create these resources in separate templates, as you only need to create the role and database one time. To look at the data from the other bitcoin exchanges provided in the Kaggle dataset, reuse the crawler code in separate templates and stacks for biflyer, coincheck, and bit stamp, which are also provided in the same dataset.</li> 
<p>After creating the stack, which should take about 40 seconds, check the AWS Glue console where your database and crawler show up on the respective lists immediately. After the crawler runs (in about 5 minutes, per your scheduled cron expression), the table also shows up. After the table creation is complete, you can view the schema from the AWS Glue console (see Figure 3), or execute SQL queries against it using the Athena console (see Figure 4).</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/01/29/glue-coinbase-table-schema-1024x543.png" /></p> 
<p><strong>Figure 3. Schema for the coinbase historical pricing table, created with the AWS Glue crawler.</strong></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2018/01/29/athena-coinbase-table-preview-1024x576.png" /></p> 
<p><strong>Figure 4. Sample query results from the coinbase historical pricing table, using the Athena Query Editor.</strong></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Suggested next steps</strong></p> 
<p>Now that you’ve figured out how to ingest the data to a place where you can query it, you can begin to compare the data with other exchanges from the dataset. You can also merge it with other data, reformat the data to make it easier to consume, and further enable data experiments.</p> 
<p>For example, maybe you want to merge the data with other events or logs, but those events lack enough structure to build tables from them and join them with your existing tables.&nbsp;Using AWS Glue <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-classifier.html">classifiers</a>, you can use grok expressions to add structure to these additional data sources.</p> 
<p>Another example that considers the current data schema would be transforming the UNIX time format field to a conventional date field.&nbsp;AWS Glue allows for the creation of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-job.html">jobs</a> that can do such transforms on fields.&nbsp;It also allows you to use <a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/api/python/pyspark.html">PySpark</a> (Python-based <a href="http://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a> scripts) to do such transformations.&nbsp;You can later operationalize those scripts as jobs in AWS Glue, and have them run periodically or based on a trigger, perhaps to get updated data.</p> 
<p>You can write and debug your own scripts, from your local IDE, by creating development endpoints in AWS Glue.&nbsp;Further, you can develop scripts and conduct experiments using <a href="https://zeppelin.apache.org/">Apache Zeppelin</a> notebooks, deploying a server with the Zeppelin software ready to use.&nbsp;Not surprisingly, AWS Glue uses CloudFormation to deploy these Zeppelin servers.&nbsp;For more information about setting up your local IDE, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/dev-endpoint-tutorial-pycharm.html">Tutorial: Set Up PyCharm Professional with a Development Endpoint</a> to link your AWS Glue endpoint with JetBrains’ <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm Professional</a>, or see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/dev-endpoint-tutorial-EC2-notebook.html">Tutorial: Set Up an Apache Zeppelin Notebook on Amazon EC2</a> on how to create a Zeppelin notebook server on an Amazon EC2 instance right from the AWS Glue console, using CloudFormation to deploy the server.</p>
