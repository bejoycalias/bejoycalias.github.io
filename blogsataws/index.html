<p>We launched <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/gs-step-four-sync-files.html">EFS File Sync</a> a few days before <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a> 2017 and I finally have time to tell you about it!</p> 
<p>If you need to move a large collection of files from an on-premises or in-cloud file system to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/efs" title="">Amazon Elastic File System</a>, this tool is for you. Simple, single-threaded command line tools such as <code>cp</code> and <code>rsync</code> predate the cloud and cannot deliver the throughput required to move massive amounts of data from place to place. These tools are generally used as building blocks, often within scripts that take care of scheduling, orchestration, and network security.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Secure &amp; Parallel</strong></span><br /> EFS File Sync uses a secure, highly parallel data transfer mechanism that can run up to 5 times faster than the tools I mentioned above. It is available as an agent that runs within VMware ESXi or on an EC2 instance, and accesses the source file system via NFS (v3 and v4), and can be used in all AWS Regions where EFS is available. Because the agent is responsible for initiating all communication with AWS you don’t need to set up VPNs or allow inbound connections through your firewall.</p> 
<p>You can launch, control, and monitor the agent and your sync tasks from the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>. Jobs can specify the transfer of an entire file system or a specific directory tree, with the option to detect and skip files that are already present in the destination. File metadata (modification and access time, POSIX ownership and permissions, symbolic links, and hard links) is also copied.</p> 
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Using EFS File Sync</span></strong><br /> In order to write this blog post, I launched an EC2 instance, exported an NFS file system (<strong>/data</strong>), and populated the file system with the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux">Linux kernel source code</a>.</p> 
<p>I open the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/efs/home">EFS Console</a> in the same Region as my instance, and click <strong>File syncs</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_sync_splash_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I click on <strong>Get started</strong>, choose <strong>Amazon EC2</strong> as my host platform and click <strong>Launch instance</strong>, and click <strong>Connect to agent</strong> to proceed:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_sync_go_launch_2.png" /></p> 
<p>Clicking <strong>Launch instance</strong> opens the EC2 console in a separate tab. I pick a <strong>Memory optimized</strong> instance type (<strong>xlarge</strong> or bigger), configure it with a public IP address and with a security group that allows inbound traffic on port 80, and launch it as I would any other EC2 instance. Then I wait a minute or two (time to water my plants or check on my dog), and wait until the status checks pass:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_sync_instance_ready_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I capture the instance’s public IP address, return to the EFS tab, enter the address, and click on <strong>Activate agent</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_connect_to_agent_2.png" /></p> 
<p>This step retrieves the activation key from the sync agent. After it completes, I enter a name for it and click <strong>Activate agent</strong> to proceed:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_activate_agent_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Now that the agent is running and activated, I click on <strong>Create sync task</strong> to start moving some files to EFS:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_agents_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I configure the source location (the EC2 instance that I mentioned at the start of this section):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_config_source_nfs_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I also choose the destination EFS file system and specify a target location within it for my files:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_config_dest_2.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I select my sync options and click <strong>Next</strong> to review my configuration:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_config_sync_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The review looks good and I click <strong>Create sync task</strong> to start copying my files:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_review_2.png" /></p> 
<p>After the sync task has been created and its status becomes Available, I can select it and choose <strong>Start</strong> from the <strong>Actions</strong> menu to initiate a sync:</p>

<p>The whole idea started about a year <span style="color: #808080">ago</span> during an casual conversation with Jeff when I first joined AWS. While <span style="color: #808080">we’re <span style="color: #000000">usually pretty good at staying focused in our meetings, he brought up that he had just finished a book he really enjoyed and asked me if I had read it. (A book that has since been made into a movie.) I don’t think there was a way for him to even </span>imagine<span style="color: #000000"> that as a huge fan of games, both table top and video games, how stoked I would be about the idea of bringing a game to our readers.<br /> </span></span></p> 
<p>We got to talking about how great it would be to <span style="color: #808080">attempt&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000">a game that would involve the <span style="color: #808080">entire</span>&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000">suite of AWS products and our various platforms. This idea might <span style="color: #808080">appear&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000">to be <span style="color: #808080">easy<span style="color: #000000">, but it has kept us <span style="color: #808080">busy&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000">with Lone Shark for about a year and we haven’t even scratched the surface of what we would like to do. Being able to <span style="color: #808080">finally</span> share this first game with our customers has been an absolute delight.<br /> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p> 
<p>From March 8-27th, each day we have been and will be releasing a new puzzle. The clues for the puzzles are hidden <span style="color: #808080">somewhere</span> all over AWS, and once customers have found the clues they can figure out the puzzle which results in a word. That word is the name of a component to rebuild Ozz, Jeff’s robot buddy.</p> 
<p><span style="color: #808080"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #808080"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #808080"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #808080"><span style="color: #000000">We wanted to try make sure that <span style="color: #808080">anyone</span> could play and we tried to <span style="color: #808080">surround <span style="color: #000000">each puzzle with interesting Easter eggs. So far, it seems to be working and we are seeing some really cool collaborative effort between customers to solve the puzzles. From tech talks to <span style="color: #808080">women</span> who code, posts both recent and well in the past, and to Twitter and podcasts, we wanted to <span style="color: #808080">hide</span> the puzzles in places our customers might not have had a chance to really explore before. <span style="color: #808080">Given</span> how much Jeff enjoyed doing a live Twitch stream so much I won’t be surprised when he tells me he wants to do a <span style="color: #808080">TV</span> show next.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-route-53-traffic-flow/">learnings</a> we have already gathered as we are just a little past halfway in the quest are mind boggling. We have learned that there will be a <span style="color: #808080">guy</span> who figures out how to build a chicken coop in 3D to solve a puzzle, or build a script to crawl a site looking for any <span style="color: #808080">reply <span style="color: #000000">to a blog post</span></span> that might be a clue. There were puzzles we completely expected people to get <span style="color: #808080">stuck&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000">on that they have solved in a <span style="color: #808080">snap</span>. They have really </span>kept<span style="color: #000000"> us on our toes, which isn’t a <span style="color: #808080">bad</span> thing. It really doesn’t <span style="color: #808080">hurt</span> that the players are incredibly adept at thinking outside the box, and we can’t wait to tell you how the puzzles were solved at the <span style="color: #808080">end</span>.<br /> </span></span></p> 
<p><span style="color: #808080"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #808080"><span style="color: #000000">We <span style="color: #808080">still</span> have a little under a week of puzzles to go, before you can all join Jeff and special guests on a live Twitch stream to reassemble Ozz 2.0! And you don’t have to <span style="color: #808080">hold<span style="color: #000000"> off for the next time we play, as there are still many puzzles to be solved and every player matters! Just keep an eye out for new puzzles to appear everyday until March 27th, join the Reddit, come to the AMA, or take a peek into the chat and get solving!</span></span></span></span></span></span></p> 
<p>Time to <span style="color: #808080">wipe</span> off your brow, and get back into solving the last of the puzzles!

<p>Today we’re releasing a new machine learning feature in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-analytics/">Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics</a> for detecting “hotspots” in your streaming data. We launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-kinesis-analytics-process-streaming-data-in-real-time-with-sql/">Kinesis Data Analytics</a> in August of 2016 and we’ve continued to add features since. As you may already know, Kinesis Data Analytics is a fully managed real-time processing engine for streaming data that lets you write SQL queries to derive meaning from your data and output the results to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/">Kinesis Data Firehose</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/">Kinesis Data Streams</a>, or even an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> function. The new <code>HOTSPOTS</code> function adds to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/real-time-clickstream-anomaly-detection-with-amazon-kinesis-analytics/">existing machine learning capabilities</a> in Kinesis that allow customers to leverage unsupervised streaming based machine learning algorithms. Customers don’t need to be experts in data science or machine learning to take advantage of these capabilities.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d1.awsstatic.com/diagrams/product-page-diagrams/diagram-how-it-works-kinesis-data-analytics.6298bab19eaf33227cce667729cbba2a6ac8af18.png" /></p> 
<h3>Hotspots</h3> 
<p>The <code><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/sqlref/sqlrf-hotspots.html">HOTSPOTS</a></code> function is a new Kinesis Data Analytics SQL function you can use to idenitfy relatively dense regions in your data without having to explicity build and train complicated machine learning models. You can identify subsections of your data that need immediate attention and take action programatically by streaming the hotspots out to a Kinesis Data stream, to a Firehose delivery stream, or by invoking a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> function.</p> 
<p>There are a ton of really cool scenarios where this could make your operations easier. Imagine a ride-share program or autonomous vehicle fleet communicating spatiotemporal data about traffic jams and congestion, or a datacenter where a number of servers start to overheat indicating an HVAC issue. <code>HOTSPOTS</code> is not limited to spatiotemporal data and you could apply it across many problem domains.</p> 
<p>The function follows some simple syntax and accepts the <code>DOUBLE</code>, <code>INTEGER</code>, <code>FLOAT</code>, <code>TINYINT</code>, <code>SMALLINT</code>, <code>REAL</code>, and <code>BIGINT</code> data types.</p> 
<p>The <code>HOTSPOTS</code> function takes a cursor as input and returns a JSON string describing the hotspot. This will be easier to understand with an example.</p> 
<h3>Using Kinesis Data Analytics to Detect Hotspots</h3> 
<p>Let’s take a simple data set from <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml">NY Taxi and&nbsp;Limousine&nbsp;Commission</a> that tracks yellow cab pickup and dropoff locations.&nbsp;Most of this data is already on S3 and publicly accessible at s3://nyc-tlc/. We will create a small python script to load our Kinesis Data Stream with Taxi records which will feed our Kinesis Data Analytics. Finally we’ll output all of this to a Kinesis Data Firehose connected to an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/" title="">Amazon Elasticsearch Service</a> cluster for visualization with Kibana. I know from living in New York for 5 years that we’ll probably find a hotspot or two in this data.</p> 
<p>First, we’ll create an input&nbsp;Kinesis stream and start sending our NYC Taxi Ride data into it. I just&nbsp;wrote a quick python script to read from one of the CSV files and used boto3 to push the records into Kinesis. You can put the record in whatever way works for you.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<code class="lang-python">import csv
import json
import boto3
def chunkit(l, n):
&quot;&quot;&quot;Yield successive n-sized chunks from l.&quot;&quot;&quot;
for i in range(0, len(l), n):
yield l[i:i + n]
kinesis = boto3.client(&quot;kinesis&quot;)
with open(&quot;taxidata2.csv&quot;) as f:
reader = csv.DictReader(f)
records = chunkit([{&quot;PartitionKey&quot;: &quot;taxis&quot;, &quot;Data&quot;: json.dumps(row)} for row in reader], 500)
for chunk in records:
kinesis.put_records(StreamName=&quot;TaxiData&quot;, Records=chunk)</code> 
<p>Next, we’ll create the Kinesis&nbsp;Data&nbsp;Analytics application and add our input stream with our taxi data as the source.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/19/kinesis_5-1024x420.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/19/kinesis_4-1024x370.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/20/kinesis_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Next we’ll automatically detect the schema.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/20/kinesis_2-1-1024x736.png" /></p> 
<p>Now we’ll create a quick SQL Script to detect our hotspots and add that to the Real Time Analytics section of our application.</p> 
<code class="lang-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM &quot;DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM&quot; (
&quot;pickup_longitude&quot; DOUBLE,
&quot;pickup_latitude&quot; DOUBLE,
HOTSPOTS_RESULT VARCHAR(10000)
); 
CREATE OR REPLACE PUMP &quot;STREAM_PUMP&quot; AS INSERT INTO &quot;DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM&quot; 
SELECT &quot;pickup_longitude&quot;, &quot;pickup_latitude&quot;, &quot;HOTSPOTS_RESULT&quot; FROM
TABLE(HOTSPOTS(
CURSOR(SELECT STREAM * FROM &quot;SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001&quot;),
1000,
0.013,
20
)
);
</code> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/20/kinesis_7-1-1024x721.png">documentation</a>. The <code>HOTSPOTS_RESULT</code> returns some useful JSON that would let us plot bounding boxes around our hotspots:<br /> <code></code></p> 
{
&quot;hotspots&quot;: [
{
&quot;density&quot;: &quot;elided&quot;,
&quot;minValues&quot;: [40.7915039, -74.0077401],
&quot;maxValues&quot;: [40.7915041, -74.0078001]
}
]
} 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When we have our desired results we can save the script and connect our application to our Amazon Elastic Search Service Firehose Delivery Stream. We can run an intermediate lambda function in the firehose to transform our record into a format more suitable for geographic work. Then we can update our mapping in Elasticsearch to index the hotspot objects as Geo-Shapes.</p> 
<p>Finally, we can connect to Kibana and visualize the results.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/20/Screen-Shot-2018-03-20-at-10.48.12-AM.png" /></p> 
<p>Looks like Manhattan is pretty busy!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> This feature is available now in all existing regions with Kinesis Data Analytics. I think this is a really interesting new feature of Kinesis Data Analytics that can bring immediate value to many applications. Let us know what you build with it on Twitter or in the comments!</p>

<p>As a follow-up to our earlier work to provide <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/heads-up-longer-ec2-ebs-resource-ids-coming-in-2016/">longer IDs</a> for a small set of essential EC2 resources, we are now doing the same for the remaining EC2 resources, with a migration deadline of July 2018. You can opt-in on a per-user, per-region, per-type basis and verify that your code, regular expressions, database schemas, and database queries work as expected</p> 
<p>If you have code that recognizes, processes, or stores IDs for any type of EC2 resources, please read this post with care! Here’s what you need to know:</p> 
<p><strong>Migration Deadline</strong> – You have until July 2018 to make sure that your code and your schemas can process and store the new, longer IDs. After that, longer IDs will be assigned by default for all newly created resources. IDs for existing resources will remain as-is and will continue to work.</p> 
<p><strong>More Resource Types</strong> – Longer IDs are now supported for all types of EC2 resources, and you can opt-in as desired:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ec2_longer_id_setup_opt_in_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I would like to encourage you to opt-in, starting with your test accounts, as soon as possible. This will give you time to thoroughly test your code and to make any necessary changes before promoting the code to production.</p> 
<p><strong>More Regions</strong> – The longer IDs are now available in the AWS <span title="">China (Beijing)</span> and AWS <span title="">China (Ningxia)</span> Regions.</p> 
<p><strong>Test AMIs</strong> – We have published AMIs with longer IDs that you can use for testing (search for <strong>testlongids</strong> to find them in the <strong>Public images</strong>):</p>

<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ozz_2_0_4.jpg">AWS Quest</a> for quite some time and it has been great to see all of the progress made toward solving the puzzles in order to find the orangeprints that I will use to rebuild Ozz.</p> 
<p>The community effort has been impressive! There’s a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OFvY0kqA1Qkz8kQpcyoDlr_7jwyJGmGiTfGm7TOLUls/edit#gid=948135787">shared spreadsheet</a> with tabs for puzzles and clues, a busy Slack channel, and a <a href="http://awsquest-leaderboard.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/">leaderboard</a>, all organized and built by a team that spans the globe.</p> 
<p style="clear: both">I’ve been checking out the orangeprints as they are uncovered and have been doing a bit of planning and preparation to make sure that I am ready for the live-streamed rebuild on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/aws">Twitch</a> later this month. Yesterday I labeled a bunch of containers, one per puzzle, and stocked each one with the parts that I will use to rebuild the corresponding component of Ozz. Fortunately, I have at least (my last count may have skipped a few) 119,807 bricks and other parts at hand so this was easy. Here’s what I have set up so far:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/puzzle_11.jpg" /></p> 
<p>The Twitch session will take place on Tuesday, March 27 at Noon PT. In the meantime, you should check out the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/awsquest?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;src=refgoogle">#awsquest</a> tweets and see what you can do to help me to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/join-the-aws-quest-help-me-to-rebuild-ozz/">rebuild Ozz</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this year we made the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/">AWS SDK</a> developer guides available as GitHub repos (all found within the <a href="https://github.com/awsdocs">awsdocs</a> organization) and invited interested parties to contribute changes and improvements in the form of pull requests.</p> 
<p>Today we are adding over 138 additional developer and user guides to the organization, and we are looking forward to receiving your requests. You can fix bugs, improve code samples (or submit new ones), add detail, and rewrite sentences and paragraphs in the interest of accuracy or clarity. You can also look at the commit history in order to learn more about new feature and service launches and to track improvements to the documents.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Making a Contribution</strong></span><br /> Before you get started, read the <a href="https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct">Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct</a> and take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-step-functions-developer-guide/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contributing Guidelines</a> document (generally named <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code>) for the AWS service of interest. Then create a GitHub account if you don’t already have one.</p> 
<p>Once you find something to change or improve, visit the HTML version of the document and click on <strong>Edit on GitHub</strong> button at the top of the page:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/beanstalk_doc_edit_1.png" /></p> 
<p>This will allow you to edit the document in source form (typically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText">reStructuredText</a>). The source code is used to produce the HTML, PDF, and Kindle versions of the documentation.</p> 
<p>Once you are in GitHub, click on the pencil icon:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/beanstalk_forkandedit_1.png" /></p> 
<p>This creates a “fork” — a separate copy of the file that you can edit in isolation.</p> 
<p>Next, make an edit. In general, as a new contributor to an open source project, you should gain experience and build your reputation by making small, high-quality edits. I’ll change “dozens of services” to “over one hundred services” in this document:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/beanstalk_edit_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I summarize my change and click <strong>Propose file change</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/beanstalk_propose_edit_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I examine the differences to verify my changes and then click <strong>Create pull request</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/beanstalk_diff_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I review the details and click <strong>Create pull request</strong> again:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/beanstalk_create_pr_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The pull request (also known as a PR) makes its way to the Elastic Beanstalk documentation team and they get to decide if they want to accept it, reject it, or to engage in a conversation with me to learn more. The teams endeavor to respond to PRs within 48 hours, and I’ll be notified via GitHub whenever the status of the PR changes.</p> 
<p>As is the case with most open source projects, a steady stream of focused, modest-sized pull requests is preferable to the occasional king-sized request with dozens of edits inside.</p> 
<p>If I am interested in tracking changes to a repo over time, I can Watch and/or Star it:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/beanstalk_star_2.png" /></p> 
<p>If I Watch a repo, I’ll receive an email whenever there’s a new release, issue, or pull request for that service guide.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Go Fork It</strong></span><br /> This launch gives you another way to help us to improve AWS. Let me know what you think!</p>

<p>I am a regular and frequent user of <a href="https://chime.aws" title="">Amazon Chime</a>, as are most of my colleagues. In addition to dozens of ongoing point-to-point sessions with individual colleagues, I participate in one chat room for the AWS Blog team and another for the AWS Evangelists. I attend several meetings per day, and use Amazon Chime’s conferencing feature to set up my own meetings once or twice a month. While I don’t actually see the monthly bill, I am on Amazon Chime’s Pro plan, at a per-user rate of $15 per month. This is, based on feedback from our customers, a good value for users who regularly host meetings, but a bit too high for those who use the other features and/or spend more time attending meetings than hosting them.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Usage-Based Pricing</strong></span><br /> To meet the needs of these users and to make <a href="https://chime.aws" title="">Amazon Chime</a> even more economical we are introducing a new, usage-based pricing model that goes in to effect on April 1, 2018.</p> 
<p>During the initial, 30-day free trial, users have access to all <a href="https://chime.aws" title="">Amazon Chime</a> features at no charge. After the trial period ends, the users can chat with each other and attend meetings, both at no charge. On days that they host meetings, a $3 per day charge will be made, up to a maximum of $15 per month. Based on historical usage patterns, this will result in an overall price reduction for virtually all <a href="https://chime.aws" title="">Amazon Chime</a> customers.</p> 
<p>In order to use the scheduling and hosting features after the end of the trial period, users must be connected to an AWS account and the administrator must enable the Amazon Pro Features features for the account. Thanks to the usage-based model, administrators will no longer have to purchase licenses for individual users in their organization. Instead, they can use Active Directory settings and policy management within the Amazon Chime Console to set permissions as desired.</p> 
<p>As part of this change we are also eliminating the Plus plan and adding the screen sharing and corporate directory features to the Basic plan.</p> 
<p>This change goes in to effect on April 1, 2018! To learn more, take a look at the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/chime/pricing/">Amazon Chime Pricing</a> page.</p>

<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ozz_2_0_3.jpg">weekly videos</a>, you may have noticed an orange robot in the background from time to time. That’s Ozz, my robot friend and helper. Built from the ground up in my home laboratory, Ozz is an invaluable part of the AWS blogging process!</p> 
<p>Sadly, when we announced we are adding the <a href="http://d1le29qyzha1u4.cloudfront.net/AWS_Podcast_Episode_234.mp3">AWS Podcast</a> to the blog, Ozz literally went to pieces and all I have left is a large pile of bricks and some great memories of our time together. From what I can tell, Ozz went haywire over this new development due to excessive enthusiasm!</p> 
<p>Ozz, perhaps anticipating that this could happen at some point, buried a set of clues (each pointing to carefully protected plans) in this blog, in the AWS Podcast, and in other parts of the AWS site. If we can find and decode these plans, we can rebuild Ozz, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Six_Million_Dollar_Man">better, stronger, and faster</a>. Unfortunately, due to concerns about the ultra-competitive robot friend market, Ozz concealed each of the plans inside a set of devious, brain-twisting puzzles. You are going to need to look high, low, inside, outside, around, and through the clues in order to figure this one out. You may even need to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Millionaire%3F">phone a friend</a> or two.</p> 
<p>Your mission, <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible">should you choose to accept it</a>, is to find these clues, decode the plans, and help me to rebuild Ozz. The information that I have is a bit fuzzy, but I think there are 20 or so puzzles, each one describing one part of Ozz. If we can solve them all, we’ll get together on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/aws">Twitch</a> later this month and put Ozz back together. We’ll be posting additional clues every day or two, so be sure to keep your eyes wide open.</p> 
<p>Are you with me on this? <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/awsquest/">Let’s do it! </a></p>
