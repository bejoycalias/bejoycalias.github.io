<p>Our customers are using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot" title="">AWS IoT</a> to make their connected devices more intelligent. These devices collect &amp; measure data in the field (below the ground, in the air, in the water, on factory floors and in hospital rooms) and use <span title="">AWS IoT</span> as their gateway to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" title="">AWS Cloud</a>. Once connected to the cloud, customers can write device data to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" title="">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, process data using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/" title="">Amazon Kinesis</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> functions, initiate <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns/" title="">Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)</a> push notifications, and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-rule-actions.html">much more</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Pricing Model (20-40% Reduction)</strong></span><br /> Today we are making a change to the <span title="">AWS IoT</span> pricing model that will make it an even better value for you. Most customers will see a price reduction of 20-40%, with some receiving a significantly larger discount depending on their workload.</p> 
<p>The original model was based on a charge for the number of messages that were sent to or from the service. This all-inclusive model was a good starting point, but also meant that some customers were effectively paying for parts of <span title="">AWS IoT</span> that they did not actually use. For example, some customers have devices that ping <span title="">AWS IoT</span> very frequently, with sparse rule sets that fire infrequently. Our new model is more fine-grained, with independent charges for each component (all prices are for devices that connect to the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span> Region):</p> 
<p><strong>Connectivity</strong> – Metered in 1 minute increments and based on the total time your devices are connected to <span title="">AWS IoT</span>. Priced at $0.08 per million minutes of connection (equivalent to $0.042 per device per year for 24/7 connectivity). Your devices can send keep-alive pings at 30 second to 20 minute intervals at no additional cost.</p> 
<p><strong>Messaging</strong> – Metered by the number of messages transmitted between your devices and <span title="">AWS IoT</span>. Pricing starts at $1 per million messages, with volume pricing falling as low as $0.70 per million. You may send and receive messages up to 128 kilobytes in size. Messages are metered in 5 kilobyte increments (up from 512 bytes previously). For example, an 8 kilobyte message is metered as two messages.</p> 
<p><strong>Rules Engine</strong> – Metered for each time a rule is triggered, and for the number of actions executed within a rule, with a minimum of one action per rule. Priced at $0.15 per million rules-triggered and $0.15 per million actions-executed. Rules that process a message in excess of 5 kilobytes are metered at the next multiple of the 5 kilobyte size. For example, a rule that processes an 8 kilobyte message is metered as two rules.</p> 
<p><strong>Device Shadow &amp; Registry Updates</strong> – Metered on the number of operations to access or modify Device Shadow or Registry data, priced at $1.25 per million operations. Device Shadow and Registry operations are metered in 1 kilobyte increments of the Device Shadow or Registry record size. For example, an update to a 1.5 kilobyte Shadow record is metered as two operations.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" title="">AWS Free Tier</a> now offers a generous allocation of connection minutes, messages, triggered rules, rules actions, Shadow, and Registry usage, enough to operate a fleet of up to 50 devices. The new prices will take effect on January 1, 2018 with no effort on your part. At that time, the updated prices will be published on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-platform/pricing/">AWS IoT Pricing</a> page.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/p/feature/z6o9g6sysxur57t"><img style="border: 1px solid black;float: right;margin-left: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/bezos_muscle_man_3.jpeg" /></a>We launched the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/the-new-cost-explorer-for-aws/">AWS Cost Explorer</a> a couple of years ago in order to allow you to track, allocate, and manage your AWS costs. The response to that launch, and to additions that we have made since then, has been very positive. However our customers are, as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/p/feature/z6o9g6sysxur57t">Jeff Bezos has said</a>, “beautifully, wonderfully, dissatisfied.”</p> 
<p>I see this first-hand every day. We launch something and that launch inspires our customers to ask for even more. For example, with many customers going all-in and moving large parts of their IT infrastructure to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" title="">AWS Cloud</a>, we’ve had many requests for the raw data that feeds into the Cost Explorer. These customers want to programmatically explore their AWS costs, update ledgers and accounting systems with per-application and per-department costs, and to build high-level dashboards that summarize spending. Some of these customers have been going to the trouble of extracting the data from the charts and reports provided by Cost Explorer!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Cost Explorer API</strong></span><br /> Today we are making the underlying data that feeds into Cost Explorer available programmatically. The new Cost Explorer API gives you a set of functions that allow you do everything that I described above. You can retrieve cost and usage data that is filtered and grouped across multiple dimensions (Service, Linked Account, tag, Availability Zone, and so forth), aggregated by day or by month. This gives you the power to start simple (total monthly costs) and to refine your requests to any desired level of detail (writes to DynamoDB tables that have been tagged as <strong>production</strong>) while getting responses in seconds.</p> 
<p>Here are the operations:</p> 
<p><img style="float: right;border: 1px solid black;margin-left: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/api_ce_2.png" width="400" height="227" /><code>GetCostAndUsage</code> – Retrieve cost and usage metrics for a single account or all accounts (master accounts in an organization have access to all member accounts) with filtering and grouping.</p> 
<p><code>GetDimensionValues</code> – Retrieve available filter values for a specified filter over a specified period of time.</p> 
<p><code>GetTags</code> – Retrieve available tag keys and tag values over a specified period of time.</p> 
<p><code>GetReservationUtilization</code> – Retrieve EC2 Reserved Instance utilization over a specified period of time, with daily or monthly granularity plus filtering and grouping.</p> 
<p>I believe that these functions, and the data that they return, will give you the ability to do some really interesting things that will give you better insights into your business. For example, you could tag the resources used to support individual marketing campaigns or development projects and then deep-dive into the costs to measure business value. You now have the potential to know, down to the penny, how much you spend on infrastructure for important events like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Monday">Cyber Monday</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping)">Black Friday</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Things to Know</strong></span><br /> Here are a couple of things to keep in mind as you start to think about ways to make use of the API:</p> 
<p><strong>Grouping</strong> – The Cost Explorer web application provides you with one level of grouping; the APIs give you two. For example you could group costs or RI utilization by Service and then by Region.</p> 
<p><strong>Pagination</strong> – The functions can return very large amounts of data and follow the AWS-wide model for pagination by including a <code>nextPageToken</code> if additional data is available. You simply call the same function again, supplying the token, to move forward.</p> 
<p><strong>Regions</strong> – The service endpoint is in the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span> Region and returns usage data for all public AWS Regions.</p> 
<p><strong>Pricing </strong>– Each API call costs $0.01. To put this into perspective, let’s say you use this API to build a dashboard and it gets 1000 hits per month from your users. Your operating cost for the dashboard should be $10 or so; this is far less expensive than setting up your own systems to extract &amp; ingest the data and respond to interactive queries.</p> 
<p>The Cost Explorer API is available now and you can start using it today. To learn more, read about the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-explorer-api.html">Cost Explorer API</a>.</p>

<p>We don’t often recognize or celebrate anniversaries at AWS. With nearly 100 services on our list, we’d be eating cake and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f45Uo5rw6YY">drinking champagne</a> several times a week. While that might sound like fun, we’d rather spend our working hours listening to customers and innovating. With that said, <a href="https://quicksight.aws" title="">Amazon QuickSight</a> has now been generally available for a little over a year and I would like to give you a quick update!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>QuickSight in Action</strong></span><br /> Today, tens of thousands of customers (from startups to enterprises, in industries as varied as transportation, legal, mining, and healthcare) are using QuickSight to analyze and report on their business data.</p> 
<p>Here are a couple of examples:</p> 
<p><a href="https://gemini.legal/"><img style="float: right" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/qs_gemini_1.png" /></a><a href="https://gemini.legal/"><strong>Gemini</strong></a> provides legal evidence procurement for California attorneys who represent injured workers. They have gone from creating custom reports and running one-off queries to creating and sharing dynamic QuickSight dashboards with drill-downs and filtering. QuickSight is used to track sales pipeline, measure order throughput, and to locate bottlenecks in the order processing pipeline.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.jivochat.com/"><img style="float: right" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/qs_jivochat_1.png" /></a><strong><a href="https://www.jivochat.com/">Jivochat</a></strong> provides a real-time messaging platform to connect visitors to website owners. QuickSight lets them create and share interactive dashboards while also providing access to the underlying datasets. This has allowed them to move beyond the sharing of static spreadsheets, ensuring that everyone is looking at the same data and is empowered to make timely decisions based on current data.</p> 
<p><a href="http://transfix.io/"><img style="float: right" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/qs_transfix_2.png" width="261" height="71" /></a><strong><a href="http://transfix.io/">Transfix</a></strong> is a tech-powered freight marketplace that matches loads and increases visibility into logistics for Fortune 500 shippers in retail, food and beverage, manufacturing, and other industries. QuickSight has made analytics accessible to both BI engineers and non-technical business users. They scrutinize key business and operational metrics including shipping routes, carrier efficient, and process automation.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Looking Back / Looking Ahead</strong></span><br /> The feedback on QuickSight has been incredibly helpful. Customers tell us that their employees are using QuickSight to connect to their data, perform analytics, and make high-velocity, data-driven decisions, all without setting up or running their own BI infrastructure. We love all of the feedback that we get, and use it to drive our roadmap, leading to the introduction of over 40 new features in just a year. Here’s a summary:</p>

<p>Looking forward, we are watching an interesting trend develop within our customer base. As these customers take a close look at how they analyze and report on data, they are realizing that a serverless approach offers some tangible benefits. They use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a> as a data lake and query it using a combination of QuickSight and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/athena" title="">Amazon Athena</a>, giving them agility and flexibility without static infrastructure. They also make great use of QuickSight’s dashboards feature, monitoring business results and operational metrics, then sharing their insights with hundreds of users. You can read <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/building-a-serverless-analytics-solution-for-cleaner-cities/">Building a Serverless Analytics Solution for Cleaner Cities</a> and review <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/serverless-big-data-analytics-with-amazon-athena-and-amazon-quicksight-may-2017-aws-online-tech-talks">Serverless Big Data Analytics using Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight</a> if you are interested in this approach.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Features and Enhancements</strong></span><br /> We’re still doing our best to listen and to learn, and to make sure that QuickSight continues to meet your needs. I’m happy to announce that we are making seven big additions today:</p> 
<p><strong>Geospatial Visualization</strong> – You can now create geospatial visuals on geographical data sets.</p> 
<p><strong>Private VPC Access</strong> – You can now sign up to access a preview of a new feature that allows you to securely connect to data within VPCs or on-premises, without the need for public endpoints.</p> 
<p><strong>Flat Table Support</strong> – In addition to pivot tables, you can now use flat tables for tabular reporting. To learn more, read about <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/tabular.html">Using Tabular Reports</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>Calculated SPICE Fields</strong> – You can now perform run-time calculations on SPICE data as part of your analysis. Read <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/adding-a-calculated-field-analysis.html">Adding a Calculated Field to an Analysis</a> for more information.</p> 
<p><strong>Wide Table Support</strong> – You can now use tables with up to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/data-source-limits.html">1000 columns</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>Other Buckets</strong> – You can summarize the long tail of high-cardinality data into buckets, as described in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/working-with-visual-types.html">Working with Visual Types in Amazon QuickSight</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>HIPAA Compliance</strong> – You can now run HIPAA-compliant workloads on QuickSight.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Geospatial Visualization</strong></span><br /> Everyone seems to want this feature! You can now take data that contains a geographic identifier (country, city, state, or zip code) and create beautiful visualizations with just a few clicks. QuickSight will geocode the identifier that you supply, and can also accept lat/long map coordinates. You can use this feature to visualize sales by state, map stores to shipping destinations, and so forth. Here’s a sample visualization:</p> 
<p><img class="size-medium aligncenter" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/qs_geo_1.png" width="900" height="570" /></p> 
<p>To learn more about this feature, read <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/geospatial-charts.html">Using Geospatial Charts (Maps)</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/geospatial-data-prep.html">Adding Geospatial Data</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Private VPC Access</strong><strong> Preview</strong></span><br /> If you have data in AWS (perhaps in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/" title="">Amazon Redshift</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" title="">Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)</a>, or on EC2) or on-premises in Teradata or SQL Server on servers without public connectivity, this feature is for you. Private VPC Access for QuickSight uses an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) for secure, private communication with data sources in a VPC. It also allows you to use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/" title="">AWS Direct Connect</a> to create a secure, private link with your on-premises resources. Here’s what it looks like:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/qs_vpc_private_1.png" width="800" height="318" /></p> 
<p>If you are ready to join the preview, you can <a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/quicksightprivatevpcpreview.html">sign up today</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this year we <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-ec2-instances-with-4-tb-of-memory/">launched</a> the <strong>x1e.32xlarge</strong> instances in four AWS Regions with 4 TB of memory. Today, two months after that launch, customers are using these instances to run high-performance relational and NoSQL databases, in-memory databases, and other enterprise applications that are able to take advantage of large amounts of memory.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Five More Sizes of X1e</strong></span><br /> I am happy to announce that we are extending the memory-optimized X1e family with five additional instance sizes. Here’s the lineup:</p>

<p>At last year’s AWS re:Invent we launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-opsworks-for-chef-automate/">AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate</a> which enabled customers to get their own Chef Automate server, managed by AWS. Building on customer feedback we’re excited to bring Puppet Enterprise to OpsWorks today.</p> 
<p>Puppet Enterprise allows you to automate provisioning, configuring, and managing instances through a <i>puppet-agent</i> deployed on each managed node. You can define a configuration once and apply it to thousands of nodes with automatic rollback and drift detection. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/puppetenterprise/">AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise</a> eliminates the need to maintain your own Puppet masters while working seamlessly with your existing Puppet manifests.</p> 
<p>OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise will manage the Puppet master server for you and take care of operational tasks like installation, upgrades, and backups. It also simplifies node registration and offers a useful starter kit for bootstrapping your nodes. More details below.</p> 
<h3>Creating a Managed Puppet Master</h3> 
<p>Creating a Puppet master in OpsWorks is simple. First navigate to the OpsWorks console <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/cm/home#/puppet/">Puppet</a> section and click “Create Puppet Enterprise Server”.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21867" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/15/ops_puppet_1.png" alt="" width="1280" height="589" /></p> 
<p>On this first part of the setup you configure the region and EC2 instance type for your Puppet master. A <i>c4.large</i> can support up to 450 nodes while a <i>c4.2xlarge</i> can support 1600+ nodes. Your Puppet Enterprise server will be provisioned with the newest version of Amazon Linux (2017.09) and the most current version of Puppet Enterprise (2017.3.2).</p> 
<p>On the next screen of the setup you can optionally configure an SSH key to connect your Puppet master. This is useful if you’ll be making any major customizations but it’s a good general practice to interact with Puppet through the client tools rather than directly on the instance itself.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21866" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/15/ops_puppet_2.png" alt="" width="1280" height="732" /></p> 
<p>Also on this page, you can setup an <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/r10k">r10k</a> repo to pull dynamic configurations.</p> 
<p>In the advanced settings page you can select the usual deployment options around VPCs, security groups, IAM roles, and instance profiles. If you choose to have OpsWorks create the instance security group for you, do note that it will be open by default so it’s important to restrict access to this later.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21865" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/15/ops_puppet_3-1.png" alt="" width="934" height="910" /></p> 
<p>Two components to pay attention to on this page are the maintenance window and backup configurations. When new minor versions of Puppet software become available, system maintenance is designed to update the minor version of Puppet Enterprise on your Puppet master automatically, as soon as it passes AWS testing. AWS performs extensive testing to verify that Puppet upgrades are production-ready and will deploy without disrupting existing customer environments. Automated backups allow you to store durable backups of your Puppet master in S3 and to restore from those backups at anytime. You can adjust the backup frequency and retention based on your business needs.</p> 
<h3>Using AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise</h3> 
<p>While your Puppet master is provisioning there are two helpful information boxes provided in the console.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21873" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/15/ops_puppet_4_2.png" alt="" width="1280" height="725" /></p> 
<p>You can download your sign-in credentials as well as sample <i>userdata</i> for installing the puppet-agent onto your Windows and Linux nodes. An important note here is that you’re able to manage your on-premises nodes as well, provided they have connectivity to your Puppet master.</p> 
<p>Once your Puppet master is fully provisioned you can access the Puppet Enterprise http console and use Puppet as you normally would.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21863" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/15/ops_puppet_5.png" alt="" width="1280" height="651" /></p> 
<h3>Useful Details</h3> 
<p>AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise is priced in Node Hours for your managed nodes. Prices start at $0.017 per-node-hour and decrease with volume of nodes – you can see the full pricing page <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/puppetenterprise/pricing/">here</a>. You’ll also pay for the underlying resources required to run your Puppet master. At launch AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise is available in US East (N. Virginia) Region, US West (Oregon) Region, and EU (Ireland) Region. Of course everything you’ve seen in the console can also be accomplished through the AWS SDKs and CLI. You can get more information in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/gettingstarted-opspup.html">Getting Started Guide</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/" title="">Amazon ElastiCache</a> makes it easy to for you to set up a fast, in-memory data store and cache. With support for the two most popular open source offerings (Redis and Memcached), ElastiCache supports the demanding needs of game leaderboards, in-memory analytics, and large-scale messaging.</p> 
<p>Today I would like to tell you about an important addition to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis/">Amazon ElastiCache for Redis</a>. You can already create clusters with up to 15 shards, each responsible for storing keys and values for a specific set of slots (each cluster has exactly 16,384 slots). A single cluster can expand to store 3.55 terabytes of in-memory data while supporting up to 20 million reads and 4.5 million writes per second.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Now with Online Resizing</strong></span><br /> You can now adjust the number of shards in a running ElastiCache for Redis cluster while the cluster remains online and responding to requests. This gives you the power to respond to changes in traffic and data volume without having to take the cluster offline or to start with an empty cache. You can also rebalance a running cluster to uniformly redistribute slot space without changing the number of shards.</p> 
<p>When you initiate a resharding or rebalancing operation, ElastiCache for Redis starts by preparing a plan that will result in an even distribution of slots across the shards in the cluster. Then it transfers slots across shards, moving many in parallel for efficiency. This all happens while the cluster continues to respond to requests, with a modest impact on write throughput for writes to a slot that is in motion. The migration rate is dependent on the instance type, network speed, read/write traffic to the slots, and is generally about 1 gigabyte per minute.</p> 
<p>The resharding and rebalancing operations apply to Redis clusters that were created with Cluster Mode enabled:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ec_cluster_it_is_2.png" width="714" height="299" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Resharding a Cluster</strong></span><br /> <img style="float: right;padding-left: 8px;padding-bottom: 8px" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ec_metrics_1.png" width="360" height="266" />In general, you will know that it is time to expand a cluster via resharding when it starts to face significant memory pressure or when individual nodes are becoming bottlenecks. You can watch the cluster’s CloudWatch metrics to identify each situation:</p> 
<p><strong>Memory Pressure</strong> – FreeableMemory, SwapUsage, BytesUsedForCache.</p> 
<p><strong>CPU Bottleneck</strong> – CPUUtilization, CurrConnections, NewConnections.</p> 
<p><strong>Network Bottleneck</strong> – NetworkBytesIn, NetworkBytesOut.</p> 
<p>You can use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudwatch-dashboards-create-use-customized-metrics-views/">CloudWatch Dashboards</a> to monitor these metrics, and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html">CloudWatch Alarms</a> to automate the resharding process.</p> 
<p>To reshard a Redis cluster from the ElastiCache Dashboard, click on the cluster to visit the detail page, and then click on the <strong>Add shards</strong> button:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ec_cluster_detail_1.png" width="554" height="349" /></p> 
<p>Enter the number of shards to add and (optionally) the desired Availability Zones, then click on <strong>Add</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ec_add_them_shards_2.png" width="671" height="572" /></p> 
<p>The status of the cluster will change to modifying and the resharding process will begin. It can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, as indicated above. You can track the progress on the detail page for the cluster:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ec_resharding_1.png" width="555" height="409" /></p> 
<p>You can see the slots moving from shard to shard:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ec_slots_on_fire_1.png" width="632" height="305" /></p> 
<p>You can also watch the Events for the cluster:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ec_events_1.png" width="810" height="147" /></p> 
<p>During the resharding you should avoid the use of the <a href="https://redis.io/commands/keys"><code>KEYS</code></a> and <a href="https://redis.io/commands/smembers"><code>SMEMBERS</code></a> commands, as well as compute-intensive Lua scripts in order to moderate the load on the cluster shards. You should avoid the <a href="https://redis.io/commands/flushdb"><code>FLUSHDB</code></a> and <a href="https://redis.io/commands/flushall"><code>FLUSHALL</code></a> commands entirely; using them will interrupt and then abort the resharding process.</p> 
<p>The status of each shard will return to <strong>available</strong> when the process is complete:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ec_i_said_shard_not_shart_1.png" width="640" height="405" /></p> 
<p>The same process takes place when you delete shards.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Rebalancing Slots</strong></span><br /> You can perform this operation by heading to the cluster’s detail page and clicking on <strong>Rebalance Slot Distribution</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ec_rebalance_2.png" width="679" height="289" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Things to Know</strong></span><br /> Here are a couple of things to keep in mind about this new feature:</p> 
<p><strong>Engine Version</strong> – Your cluster must be running version 3.2.10 of the Redis engine.</p> 
<p><strong>Migration Size</strong> – Slots that contain items that are larger than 256 megabytes after serialization are not migrated.</p> 
<p><strong>Cluster Endpoint</strong> – The cluster endpoint does not change as a result of a resharding or rebalancing.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> This feature is available now and you can start using it today.</p>

<p>This guest post is by <a href="https://twitter.com/colmmacc">Colm MacC&aacute;rthaigh</a>, Senior Engineer for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a>.</p> 
<hr /> 
<p>Since VPC Endpoints launched in 2015, creating Endpoints has been a popular way to securely access S3 and DynamoDB from an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) without the need for an Internet gateway, a NAT gateway, or firewall proxies. With VPC Endpoints, the routing between the VPC and the AWS service is handled by the AWS network, and IAM policies can be used to control access to service resources.</p> 
<p>Today we are announcing AWS PrivateLink, the newest generation of VPC Endpoints which is designed for customers to access AWS services in a highly available and scalable manner, while keeping all the traffic within the AWS network. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/">Kinesis</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/">Service Catalog</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/systems-manager/">EC2 Systems Manager</a> (SSM), and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/">Elastic Load Balancing</a> (ELB) APIs are now available to use inside your VPC, with support for more services coming soon such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">Key Management Service</a> (KMS) and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">Amazon Cloudwatch</a>.</p> 
<p>With traditional endpoints, it’s very much like connecting a virtual cable between your VPC and the AWS service. Connectivity to the AWS service does not require an Internet or NAT gateway, but the endpoint remains outside of your VPC. With PrivateLink, endpoints are instead created directly inside of your VPC, using Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) and IP addresses in your VPC’s subnets. The service is now in your VPC, enabling connectivity to AWS services via private IP addresses. That means that VPC Security Groups can be used to manage access to the endpoints and that PrivateLink endpoints can also be accessed from your premises via AWS Direct Connect.</p> 
<p>Using the services powered by PrivateLink, customers can now manage fleets of instances, create and manage catalogs of IT services as well as store and process data, without requiring the traffic to traverse the Internet.</p> 
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Creating a PrivateLink Endpoint<br /> </span></strong>To create a PrivateLink endpoint, I navigate to the VPC Console, select <strong>Endpoints</strong>, and choose <strong>Create Endpoint</strong>.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/09/12/Create-Endpoint-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20907" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/09/12/Create-Endpoint-1.png" alt="" width="1049" height="483" /></a></p> 
<p>I then choose which service I’d like to access. New PrivateLink endpoints have an “interface” type. In this case I’d like to use the Kinesis service directly from my VPC and I choose the <strong>kinesis-streams </strong>service.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/09/12/Create-Endpoint-2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20908" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/09/12/Create-Endpoint-2.png" alt="" width="1047" height="611" /></a></p> 
<p>At this point I can choose which of my VPCs I’d like to launch my new endpoint in, and select the subnets that the ENIs and IP addresses will be placed in. I can also associate the endpoint with a new or existing Security Group, allowing me to control which of my instances can access the Endpoint.</p> 
<p>Because PrivateLink endpoints will use IP addresses from my VPC, I have the option to over-ride DNS for the AWS service DNS name by using VPC Private DNS. By leaving <strong>Enable Private DNS Name </strong>checked, lookups from within my VPC for “kinesis.us-east-1.amazonaws.com” will resolve to the IP addresses for the endpoint that I’m creating. This makes the transition to the endpoint seamless without requiring any changes to my applications. If I’d prefer to test or configure the endpoint before handling traffic by default, I can leave this disabled and then change it at any time by editing the endpoint.</p> 
<p>Once I’m ready and happy with the VPC, subnets and DNS settings, I click <strong>Create Endpoint</strong> to complete the process.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Using a PrivateLink Endpoint</strong></span></p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/09/12/VPC-Endpoint-DNS.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20910" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/09/12/VPC-Endpoint-DNS.png" alt="" width="1359" height="635" /></a></p> 
<p>By default, with the Private DNS Name enabled, using a PrivateLink endpoint is as straight-forward as using the SDK, AWS CLI or other software that accesses the service API from within your VPC. There’s no need to change any code or configurations.</p> 
<p>To support testing and advanced configurations, every endpoint also gets a set of DNS names that are unique and dedicated to your endpoint. There’s a primary name for the endpoint and zonal names.</p> 
<p>The primary name is particularly useful for accessing your endpoint via Direct Connect, without having to use any DNS over-rides on-premises. Naturally, the primary name can also be used inside of your VPC.<br /> The primary name, and the main service name – since I chose to over-ride it – include zonal fault-tolerance and will balance traffic between the Availability Zones. If I had an architecture that uses zonal isolation techniques, either for fault containment and compartmentalization, low latency, or for minimizing regional data transfer I could also use the zonal names to explicitly control whether my traffic flows between or stays within zones.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Pricing &amp; Availability</strong></span><br /> AWS PrivateLink is available today in all AWS commercial regions except&nbsp;China (Beijing). For the region availability of individual services, please check our <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-endpoints.html">documentation</a>.</p> 
<p>Pricing starts at $0.01 / hour plus a data processing charge at $0.01 / GB. Data transferred between availability zones, or between your Endpoint and your premises via Direct Connect will also incur the usual EC2 Regional and Direct Connect data transfer charges. For more information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/">VPC Pricing</a>.</p>

<p>Back in 2006, when I <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon_s3/">announced S3</a>, I wrote ” Further, each block is protected by an ACL (Access Control List) allowing the developer to keep the data private, share it for reading, or share it for reading and writing, as desired.”</p> 
<p>Starting from that initial model, with private buckets and ACLs to grant access, we have added support for <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html">bucket policies</a>, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html">server access logging</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-enhancement-versioning/">versioning</a>, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cloudtrail-logging.html">API logging</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-cross-region-replication-for-amazon-s3/">cross-region replication</a>, and multiple <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html">client-side</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-s3-server-side-encryption/">server-side encryption</a> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html">options</a>, all with the goal of giving you the tools you need to keep your data safe while allowing you to share it with customers and partners as needed. We also brought the power of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/" title="">Artificial Intelligence</a> and machine learning in to play, with the launch of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/macie/" title="">Amazon Macie</a>, a tool that helps you to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/launch-amazon-macie-securing-your-s3-buckets/">discover, classify, and secure content at scale</a>.</p> 
<p>Today we are adding five new encryption and security features to S3:</p> 
<p><strong>Default Encryption</strong> – You can now mandate that all objects in a bucket must be stored in encrypted form without having to construct a bucket policy that rejects objects that are not encrypted.</p> 
<p><strong>Permission Checks</strong> – The S3 Console now displays a prominent indicator next to each S3 bucket that is publicly accessible.</p> 
<p><strong>Cross-Region Replication ACL Overwrite</strong> – When you replicate objects across AWS accounts, you can now specify that the object gets a new ACL that gives full access to the destination account.</p> 
<p><strong>Cross-Region Replication with KMS</strong> – You can now replicate objects that are encrypted with keys that are managed by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/" title="">AWS Key Management Service (KMS)</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>Detailed Inventory Report</strong> – The S3 Inventory report now includes the encryption status of each object. The report itself can also be encrypted.</p> 
<p>Let’s take a look at each one…</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Default Encryption</strong></span><br /> You have three server-side encryption options for your S3 objects: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html">SSE-S3</a> with keys that are managed by S3, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html">SSE-KMS</a> with keys that are managed by AWS KMS, and SSE-C with keys that you manage. Some of our customers, particularly those who need to meet compliance requirements that dictate the use of encryption at rest, have used bucket policies to ensure that every newly stored object is encrypted. While this helps them to meet their requirements, simply rejecting the storage of unencrypted objects is an imperfect solution.</p> 
<p>You can now mandate that all objects in a bucket must be stored in encrypted form by installing a bucket encryption configuration. If an unencrypted object is presented to S3 and the configuration indicates that encryption must be used, the object will be encrypted using encryption option specified for the bucket (the PUT request can also specify a different option).</p> 
<p>Here’s how to enable this feature using the <a href="https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1">S3 Console</a> when you create a new bucket. Enter the name of the bucket as usual and click on <strong>Next</strong>. Then scroll down and click on <strong>Default encryption</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/s3e_pg2_1.png" width="728" height="618" /></p> 
<p>Select the desired option and click on <strong>Save</strong> (if you select AWS-KMS you also get to designate a KMS key):</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/s3e_pg2_aes256_1.png" width="719" height="493" /></p> 
<p>You can also make this change via a call to the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUTencryption.html">PUT Bucket Encryption</a> function. It must specify an SSE algorithm (either SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) and can optionally reference a KMS key.</p> 
<p>Keep the following in mind when you implement this feature:</p> 
<p><strong>SigV4</strong> – Access to the bucket policy via the S3 REST API must be signed with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">SigV4</a> and made over an SSL connection.</p> 
<p><strong>Updating Bucket Policies</strong> – You should examine and then carefully modify existing bucket policies that currently reject unencrypted objects.</p> 
<p><strong>High-Volume Use</strong> – If you are using SSE-KMS and are uploading many hundreds or thousands of objects per second, you may bump in to the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/limits.html#requests-per-second-table">KMS Limit</a> on the Encrypt and Decrypt operations. Simply file a <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/v1?region=us-east-1#/case/create">Support Case</a> and ask for a higher limit:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/s3_kms_more_limit_1.png" width="560" height="363" /></p> 
<p><strong>Cross-Region Replication</strong> – Unencrypted objects will be encrypted according to the configuration of the destination bucket. Encrypted objects will remain as such.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Permission Checks</strong></span><br /> The combination of bucket policies, bucket ACLs, and Object ACLs give you very fine-grained control over access to your buckets and the objects within them. With the goal of making sure that your policies and ACLs combine to create the desired effect, we recently launched a set of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-config-update-new-managed-rules-to-secure-s3-buckets/">Managed Config Rules to Secure Your S3 Buckets</a>. As I mentioned in the post, these rules make use of some of our work to put <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/aws-reinvent-2016-automated-formal-reasoning-about-aws-systems-sec401">Automated Formal Reasoning</a> to use.</p> 
<p>We are now using the same underlying technology to help you see the impact of changes to your bucket policies and ACLs as soon as you make them. You will know right away if you open up a bucket for public access, allowing you to make changes with confidence.</p> 
<p>Here’s what it looks like on the main page of the S3 Console (I’ve sorted by the Access column for convenience):</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/s3e_access_sort_1.png" width="891" height="349" /></p> 
<p>The Public indicator is also displayed when you look inside a single bucket:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/s3e_jb_pub_bucket_1.png" width="900" height="370" /></p> 
<p>You can also see which Permission elements (ACL, Bucket Policy, or both) are enabling the public access:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/s3e_jb_pub_all_exposed_1.png" width="900" height="535" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Cross-Region Replication ACL Overwrite</strong></span><br /> Our customers often use S3’s Cross-Region Replication to copy their mission-critical objects and data to a destination bucket in a separate AWS account. In addition to copying the object, the replication process copies the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html">object ACL</a> and any <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-tagging.html">tags</a> associated with the object.</p> 
<p>We’re making this feature even more useful by allowing you to enable replacement of the ACL as it is in transit so that it grants full access to the owner of the destination bucket. With this change, ownership of the source and the destination data is split across AWS accounts, allowing you to maintain separate and distinct stacks of ownership for the original objects and their replicas.</p> 
<p>To enable this feature when you are setting up replication, choose a destination bucket in a different account and Region by specifying the Account ID and Bucket name, and clicking on <strong>Save</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/s3e_dest_other_1.png" width="650" height="650" /></p> 
<p>Then click on <strong>Change object ownership…</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/s3e_change_ownership_1.png" width="650" height="652" /></p> 
<p>We’ve also made it easier for you to set up the key policy for the destination bucket in the destination account. Simply log in to the account and find the bucket, then click on <strong>Management</strong> and <strong>Replication</strong>, then choose <strong>Receive objects…</strong> from the <strong>More</strong> menu:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/s3e_manage_dest_ro_1.png" width="900" height="536" /></p> 
<p>Enter the source Account ID, enable versioning, inspect the policies, apply them, and click on <strong>Done</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/s3e_receive_1.png" width="650" height="650" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Cross-Region Replication with KMS</strong></span><br /> Replicating objects that have been encrypted using SSE-KMS across regions poses an interesting challenge that we are addressing today. Because the KMS keys are specific to a particular region, simply replicating the encrypted object would not work.</p> 
<p>You can now choose the destination key when you set up cross-region replication. During the replication process, encrypted objects are replicated to the destination over an SSL connection. At the destination, the data key is encrypted with the KMS master key you specified in the replication configuration. The object remains in its original, encrypted form throughout; only the envelope containing the keys is actually changed.</p> 
<p>Here’s how you enable this feature when you set up a replication rule:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/s3e_kms_replication_1.png" width="650" height="647" /></p> 
<p>As I mentioned earlier, you may need to request an increase in your KMS limits before you start to make heavy use of this feature.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Detailed Inventory Report</strong></span><br /> Last but not least, you can now request that the daily or weekly S3 inventory reports include information on the encryption status of each object:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/s3e_inventory_1.png" width="810" height="626" /></p> 
<p>As you can see, you can also request SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS encryption for the report.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Now Available</strong></span><br /> All of these features are available now and you can start using them today! There is no charge for the features, but you will be charged the usual rates for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/pricing/">calls to KMS</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/">S3 storage</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/">S3 requests</a>, and inter-region data transfer.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-reserved-instance-update-convertible-ris-and-regional-benefit/">launched</a> Convertible Reserved Instances for EC2 just about a year ago. The Convertible RIs give you a significant discount (typically 54% when compared to On-Demand) and allow you to change the instance family and other parameters associated with the RI if your needs change.</p> 
<p>Today we are introducing Convertible RIs with a 1-year term, complementing the existing 3-year term. We are also making the Convertible Reserved Instance model more flexible by allowing you to exchange portions of your RIs and to perform bulk exchanges.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New 1-Year Convertible RIs</strong></span><br /> Convertible Reserved Instances with a 1-year term are now available. This will give you more options and more flexibility; you can now purchase a mix of 1-year and 3-year Convertible Reserved Instances (CRIs) in accord with your needs. Startups with financial constraints will find this option attractive, as will other ventures that may not be in a position to make a commitment that runs for longer than one year.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Merging and Splitting Convertible RIs</strong></span><br /> Let’s say that you start running your web and application servers on M4 instances and uses Convertible RIs to save money. Later, after a tuning exercise you move your application servers to C4 instances. With today’s launch you can exchange a portion of your M4 Convertible RIs for C4 Convertible RIs. You can also merge two or more CRIs (perhaps for smaller instances) and obtain one for a larger instance.</p> 
<p>The exchange model for Convertible Reserved Instances is based on splitting, exchanging, and merging. Let’s say I own a 3-year Partial Upfront CRI for four <strong>t2.micro</strong> instances:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cri_t2_micro_4_before_2.png" width="810" height="533" /></p> 
<p>My application has changed and now I want to use a pair of <strong>t2.micro </strong>instances and a single <strong>r4.xlarge</strong>. The first step is to <em>split</em> this CRI into the part that I want to keep and the part that I want to exchange. I select it and click on <strong>Modify Reserved Instances</strong>. Then I create my desired configuration and click on Continue:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cri_modify_pair_of_2s_2.png" width="810" height="413" /></p> 
<p>I review the request and click on <strong>Submit Modifications</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cri_review_mod_request_1.png" width="810" height="305" /></p> 
<p>The state of the CRI changes to indicate that it is being modified. After a moment or two it will be marked as <strong>retired</strong>, replaced by a pair that are <strong>active</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cri_four_in_to_two_1.png" width="900" height="216" /></p> 
<p>Now I can <em>exchange</em> one of the 2-instance CRIs. I select it, click on <strong>Exchange Reserved Instance</strong>, and enter the desired configuration for my new CRI:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cri_exchange_prep_1.png" width="900" height="400" /></p> 
<p>I click on <strong>Find Offering</strong> to see my options, and choose the desired one, an <strong>r4.xlarge</strong> Partial Upfront. As you can see, the console “does the math” takes the remaining upfront value ($139.995 in this case) of the unneeded CRIs into account when computing the upfront payment:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cri_exchange_ready_1.png" /></p> 
<p>When I am ready to move forward I click on <strong>Exchange</strong>. This initiates the exchange process and lets me know that it may take a few minutes to complete.</p> 
<p>I can also <em>merge</em> two or more Convertible Reserved Instances together and then use them as the starting point for an exchange. To do this I simply select the existing CRIs, click on <strong>Action</strong>, and choose <strong>Exchange Reserved Instances</strong>. I can see the total remaining upfront value of the selected CRIs and proceed accordingly:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cri_merge_em_2.png" width="900" height="444" /></p> 
<p>You can merge CRIs that have different start dates and/or term lengths. The merged CRI will have the expiry date of the RI that is furthest from the date of exchange. Merging CRIs with different term lengths always produces a 3-year CRI.</p> 
<p>You can also perform the split, exchange, and merge operations using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a> and the EC2 APIs.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> All of the functions and the 1-year CRIs described in this post are available now and you can start using them today.</p>
