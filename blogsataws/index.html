<p>What happens when you combine the Internet of Things, Machine Learning, and Edge Computing? Before I tell you, let’s review each one and discuss what AWS has to offer.</p> 
<p><strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong> – Devices that connect the physical world and the digital one. The devices, often equipped with one or more types of sensors, can be found in factories, vehicles, mines, fields, homes, and so forth. Important AWS services include <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/">AWS IoT Core</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-analytics/">AWS IoT Analytics</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-device-management/">AWS IoT Device Management</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/freertos/">Amazon FreeRTOS</a>, along with others that you can find on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot/">AWS IoT</a> page.</p> 
<p><strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong> – Systems that can be trained using an at-scale dataset and statistical algorithms, and used to make inferences from fresh data. At Amazon we use machine learning to drive the recommendations that you see when you shop, to optimize the paths in our fulfillment centers, fly drones, and much more. We support leading open source machine learning frameworks such as <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mxnet/">MXNet</a>, and make ML accessible and easy to use through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">Amazon SageMaker</a>. We also provide <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/" title="">Amazon Rekognition</a> for images and for video, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lex" title="">Amazon Lex</a> for chatbots, and a wide array of language services for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/">text analysis</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/translate/">translation</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/">speech recognition</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/polly/">text to speech</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>Edge Computing</strong> – The power to have compute resources and decision-making capabilities in disparate locations, often with intermittent or no connectivity to the cloud. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass" title="">AWS Greengrass</a> builds on AWS IoT, giving you the ability to run Lambda functions and keep device state in sync even when not connected to the Internet.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>ML Inference at the Edge</strong></span><br /> Today I would like to toss all three of these important new technologies into a blender! You can now perform Machine Learning inference at the edge using AWS Greengrass. This allows you to use the power of the AWS cloud (including fast, powerful instances equipped with GPUs) to build, train, and test your ML models before deploying them to small, low-powered, intermittently-connected IoT devices running in those factories, vehicles, mines, fields, and homes that I mentioned.</p> 
<p>Here are a few of the many ways that you can put Greengrass ML Inference to use:</p> 
<p><strong>Precision Farming</strong> – With an ever-growing world population and unpredictable weather that can affect crop yields, the opportunity to use technology to increase yields is immense. Intelligent devices that are literally in the field can process images of soil, plants, pests, and crops, taking local corrective action and sending status reports to the cloud.</p> 
<p><strong>Physical Security</strong> – Smart devices (including the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/deeplens/" title="">AWS DeepLens</a>) can process images and scenes locally, looking for objects, watching for changes, and even detecting faces. When something of interest or concern arises, the device can pass the image or the video to the cloud and use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/" title="">Amazon Rekognition</a> to take a closer look.</p> 
<p><strong>Industrial Maintenance</strong> – Smart, local monitoring can increase operational efficiency and reduce unplanned downtime. The monitors can run inference operations on power consumption, noise levels, and vibration to flag anomalies, predict failures, detect faulty equipment.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Greengrass ML Inference Overview</strong></span><br /> There are several different aspects to this new AWS feature. Let’s take a look at each one:</p> 
<p><strong>Machine Learning Models</strong> – <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-greengrass-samples/tree/master/ml-at-edge-examples/pre-built-libraries">Precompiled TensorFlow and MXNet libraries</a>, optimized for production use on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 and Intel Atom devices, and development use on 32-bit Raspberry Pi devices.

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/efs" title="">Amazon Elastic File System</a> was designed to be the file system of choice for cloud-native applications that require shared access to file-based storage. We <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-elastic-file-system-production-ready-in-three-regions/">launched EFS</a> in mid-2016 and have added several important features since then including <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-efs-update-on-premises-access-via-direct-connect-vpc/">on-premises access via Direct Connect</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-encryption-at-rest-for-amazon-elastic-file-system-efs/">encryption of data at rest</a>. We have also made EFS available in additional AWS Regions, most recently <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/03/amazon-elastic-file-system-amazon-efs-available-in-us-west-northern-california-region/?sc_channel=sm&amp;sc_campaign=launch_&amp;sc_publisher=TWITTER&amp;sc_country=Global&amp;sc_geo=GLOBAL&amp;sc_outcome=awareness&amp;trk=sm_Elastic_File_System_d69de715_SFO_Availability_TWITTER&amp;sc_content=Elastic_File_System_d69de715_SFO_Availability&amp;sc_category=Amazon_Elastic_File_System_EFS&amp;linkId=49265187">US West (Northern California)</a>. As was the case with EFS itself, these enhancements were made in response to customer feedback, and reflect our desire to serve an ever-widening customer base.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Encryption in Transit</strong></span><br /> Today we are making EFS even more useful with the addition of support for encryption of data in transit. When used in conjunction with the existing support for encryption of data at rest, you now have the ability to protect your stored files using a defense-in-depth security strategy.</p> 
<p>In order to make it easy for you to implement encryption in transit, we are also releasing an EFS mount helper. The helper (available in <a href="https://github.com/aws/efs-utils">source code</a> and RPM form) takes care of setting up a TLS tunnel to EFS, and also allows you to mount file systems by ID. The two features are independent; you can use the helper to mount file systems by ID even if you don’t make use of encryption in transit. The helper also supplies a recommended set of default options to the actual <code>mount</code> command.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Setting up Encryption</strong></span><br /> I start by installing the EFS mount helper on my Amazon Linux instance:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">$ sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils</code> 
<p>Next, I visit the EFS Console and capture the file system ID:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_get_id_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I specify the ID (and the TLS option) to mount the file system:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">$ sudo mount -t efs fs-92758f7b -o tls /mnt/efs</code> 
<p>And that’s it! The encryption is transparent and has an almost negligible impact on data transfer speed.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> You can start using encryption in transit today in all AWS Regions where EFS is available.</p> 
<p>The mount helper is available for Amazon Linux. If you are running another distribution of Linux you will need to clone the <a href="https://github.com/aws/efs-utils">GitHub repo</a> and build your own RPM, as described in the README.</p>

<p>Today we’re launching a new feature for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/" title="AWS Certificate Manager Product Page">AWS Certificate Manager</a> (ACM), Private Certificate Authority (CA). This new service allows ACM to act as a private subordinate CA. Previously, if a customer wanted to use private certificates, they needed specialized infrastructure and security expertise that could be expensive to maintain and operate. ACM Private CA builds on ACM’s existing certificate capabilities to help you easily and securely manage the lifecycle of your private certificates with pay as you go pricing. This enables developers to provision certificates in just a few simple API calls while administrators have a central CA management console and fine grained access control through granular IAM policies. ACM Private CA keys are stored securely in AWS managed hardware security modules (HSMs) that adhere to FIPS 140-2 Level 3 security standards. ACM Private CA automatically maintains certificate revocation lists (CRLs) in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a> and lets administrators generate audit reports of certificate creation with the API or console. This service is packed full of features so let’s jump in and provision a CA.</p> 
<h3>Provisioning a Private Certificate Authority (CA)</h3> 
<p>First, I’ll navigate to the ACM console in my region and select the new <strong>Private CAs</strong> section in the sidebar. From there I’ll click <strong>Get Started</strong> to start the CA wizard. For now, I only have the option to provision a subordinate CA so we’ll select that and use my super secure desktop as the root CA and click <strong>Next</strong>. This isn’t what I would do in a production setting but it will work for testing out our private CA.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/ca_01-1024x365.png" /></p> 
<p>Now, I’ll configure the CA with some common details. The most important thing here is the <strong>Common Name</strong> which I’ll set as <code>secure.internal</code> to represent my internal domain.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/ca_02-1024x772.png" /></p> 
<p>Now I need to choose my key algorithm. You should choose the best algorithm for your needs but know that ACM has a limitation today that it can only manage certificates that chain up to to RSA CAs. For now, I’ll go with <strong>RSA 2048</strong> bit and click&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/ca_003-1024x615.png" /></p> 
<p>In this next screen, I’m able to configure my certificate revocation list (CRL). CRLs are essential for notifying clients in the case that a certificate has been compromised before certificate expiration. ACM will maintain the revocation list for me and I have the option of routing my S3 bucket to a custom domain. In this case I’ll create a new S3 bucket to store my CRL in and click <strong>Next</strong>.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/ca_03-1024x654.png" /></p> 
<p>Finally, I’ll review all the details to make sure I didn’t make any typos and click&nbsp;<strong>Confirm and create</strong>.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/ca_04-1024x801.png" /></p> 
<p>A few seconds later and I’m greeted with a fancy screen saying I successfully provisioned a certificate authority. Hooray! I’m not done yet though. I still need to activate my CA by creating a certificate signing request (CSR) and signing that with my root CA. I’ll click&nbsp;<strong>Get started&nbsp;</strong>to begin that process.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/ca_05-1024x624.png" /></p> 
<p>Now I’ll copy the CSR or download it to a server or desktop that has access to my root CA (or potentially another subordinate – so long as it chains to a trusted root for my clients).</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/ca_06-1024x844.png" /></p> 
<p>Now I can use a tool like <code>openssl</code> to sign my cert and generate the certificate chain.</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">
$openssl ca -config openssl_root.cnf -extensions v3_intermediate_ca -days 3650 -notext -md sha256 -in csr/CSR.pem -out certs/subordinate_cert.pem
Using configuration from openssl_root.cnf
Enter pass phrase for /Users/randhunt/dev/amzn/ca/private/root_private_key.pem:
Check that the request matches the signature
Signature ok
The Subject's Distinguished Name is as follows
stateOrProvinceName   :ASN.1 12:'Washington'
localityName          :ASN.1 12:'Seattle'
organizationName      :ASN.1 12:'Amazon'
organizationalUnitName:ASN.1 12:'Engineering'
commonName            :ASN.1 12:'secure.internal'
Certificate is to be certified until Mar 31 06:05:30 2028 GMT (3650 days)
Sign the certificate? [y/n]:y
1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? [y/n]y
Write out database with 1 new entries
Data Base Updated
</code> 
<p>After that I’ll copy my <code>subordinate_cert.pem</code> and certificate chain back into the console. and click&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/ca_07-1024x617.png" /></p> 
<p>Finally, I’ll review all the information and click&nbsp;<strong>Confirm and import</strong>. I&nbsp;should see a screen like the one below that shows&nbsp;my CA has been activated successfully.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/ca_09-1024x711.png" /></p> 
<p>Now that&nbsp;I have a private CA we can provision private certificates by hopping back to the ACM console and creating a new certificate. After clicking create a new certificate I’ll select&nbsp;the radio button <strong>Request a private certificate</strong> then I’ll click&nbsp;<strong>Request a certificate</strong>.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/ca_10-1024x439.png" /></p> 
<p>From there it’s just similar to provisioning a normal certificate in ACM.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/ca_11-1024x502.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/ca_12-1024x472.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/ca_13-1024x407.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/ca_14-1024x988.png" /></p> 
<p>Now I have a private certificate that I can bind to my ELBs, CloudFront Distributions, API Gateways, and more. I can also export the certificate for use on embedded devices or outside of ACM managed environments.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/ca_15-1024x480.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> ACM Private CA is a service in and of itself and it is packed full of features that won’t fit into a blog post. I strongly encourage the interested readers to go through the developer guide and familiarize themselves with certificate based security. ACM Private CA is available in in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), EU (Frankfurt) and EU (Ireland). Private CAs cost $400 per month (prorated) for each private CA. You are not charged for certificates created and maintained in ACM but you are charged for certificates where you have access to the private key (exported or created outside of ACM). The pricing per certificate is tiered starting at $0.75 per certificate for the first 1000 certificates and going down to $0.001 per certificate after 10,000 certificates.</p> 
<p>I’m excited to see administrators and developers take advantage of this new service. As always please let us know what you think of this service on Twitter or in the comments below.</p>

<p>There’s often tension between distributed and centralized control, especially in larger organizations. While a distributed control model allows teams to move fast and to respond to specialized local needs, a central model can provide the right level of oversight for global initiatives and challenges that span all teams.</p> 
<p>We’ve seen this challenge arise first-hand when AWS customers grow to the point where their application footprint encompasses a plethora of AWS regions, AWS accounts, development teams, and applications. They love the fact that AWS increases their agility and responsiveness, while letting them deploy resources in the most appropriate location. This diversity and scale brings new challenges when it comes to security and compliance. The freedom to innovate must be balanced by the need to protect important data and to respond quickly when threats emerge.</p> 
<p>Over the last couple of years we have provided our customers with an increasingly broad set of options for protection including <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-waf/">AWS WAF</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-shield-protect-your-applications-from-ddos-attacks/">AWS Shield</a>. Our customers are making great use of all of these options, and have asked for the ability to manage them from a single, central location.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Meet AWS Firewall Manager</strong></span><br /> <span title="">AWS Firewall Manager</span> is designed to help these customers! It gives them the freedom to use multiple AWS accounts and to host applications in any desired region while maintaining centralized control over their organization’s security settings and profile. Developers can develop and innovators can innovate, while the security team gains the ability to respond quickly, uniformly, and globally to potential threats and actual attacks.</p> 
<p>With automated policy enforcement across accounts &amp; applications, your security team can be confident that new and existing applications comply with organization-wide security policies when they use <span title="">Firewall Manager</span>. They can find applications and AWS resources that don’t measure up, and bring them into compliance in minutes.</p> 
<p><span title="">Firewall Manager</span> is built around named policies that contain WAF rule sets and optional AWS Shield advanced protection. Each policy applies to a specific set of AWS resources, specified by account, resource type, resource identifier, or tag. Policies can be applied automatically to all matching resources, or to a subset that you select. Policies can include WAF rules drawn from within the organization, and also those created by AWS Partners such as Imperva, F5, Trend Micro, and other AWS Marketplace vendors. This gives your security team the power to duplicate their existing on-premises security posture in the cloud.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Take the Tour</strong></span><br /> <span title="">Firewall Manager</span> has three prerequisites:</p> 
<p><strong>AWS Organizations</strong> – Your organization must be using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/" title="">AWS Organizations</a> to manage your accounts and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_org_support-all-features.html">all features</a> must be enabled. To learn more, read <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_create.html">Creating an Organization</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>Firewall Administrator</strong> – You must designate one of the AWS accounts in your organization as the administrator for Firewall Manager. This gives the account permission to deploy AWS WAF rules across the organization.</p> 
<p><strong>AWS Config</strong> – You must enable <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/config/" title="">AWS Config</a> for all of the accounts in the Organization so that <span title="">Firewall Manager</span> can detect newly created resources (you can use the <strong>Enable AWS Config</strong> template on the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-sampletemplates.html">StackSets Sample Templates</a> page to take care of this). To learn more, read <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html">Getting Started with AWS Config</a>.</p> 
<p>Since I don’t own an enterprise, my colleagues were kind enough to create some test accounts for me! When I open the <span title="">Firewall Manager</span> Console in the master account, I can see where I stand with respect to the first two prerequisites:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/fm_status_pre_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The <strong>Learn more about…</strong> button reveals the Account ID of the administrator:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/fms_admin_id_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I switch to that account (in a a real-world situation it is unlikely that I would have access to the master account and this one), open the console, and see that I now meet the prerequisites. I click <strong>Create policy</strong> to move ahead:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/fms_status_pre_ok_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The console outlines the process for me. I need to create rules and a rule group, define a policy with the rule group, define the scope of the policy, and then actually create the policy.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/fms_setup_p1_1.png" /></p> 
<p>At the bottom of the page I choose to create a new policy and rule group, for resources in the <span title="">US East (N. Virginia)</span> Region, and click <strong>Next</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/fms_setup_p1_bottom_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I specify the conditions for my rule, choosing from the following options:</p> 
<li>Cross-site scripting</li> 
<li>Geographic origin</li> 
<li>SQL injection</li> 
<li>IP address or range</li> 
<li>Size constraint</li> 
<li>String or regular expression</li> 
<p>For example, I can create a condition that blocks malicious IP addresses (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/security/aws-waf-security-automations/">this AWS Solution</a> shows you how to use a third-party reputation list with WAF, and may be helpful):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/fms_make_ip_block_2.png" /></p> 
<p>I’ll keep this one simple, but a rule can include multiple conditions. After I have added all of them, I click <strong>Next</strong> to proceed. Now I am ready to create my rule, and I click <strong>Create</strong> <strong>rule</strong> (I can add more conditions to it later if I want):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/fms_create_rule_2.png" /></p> 
<p>I give my rule a name (<strong>BlockExcludedIPs</strong>), enter a CloudWatch metric name, and add my condition (<strong>ExcludeIPs</strong>), then click <strong>Create</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/fms_create_rule_allover_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I can create more rules, and include them in the same rule group. Again, I’ll keep this one simple, and click <strong>Next</strong> to move ahead:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/fms_my_rules_rule_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I enter a name for my group, choose the rules that will make up the group, and click <strong>Create</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/fms_create_rule_group_3.png" /></p> 
<p>I now have two rule groups (testRuleGroup was already present in the account). I name my policy and click <strong>Next</strong> to proceed:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/fms_create_policy_and_add_groups_covfefe_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Now I define the scope of my policy. I choose the type of resource to be protected, and indicate when the policy should be applied:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/fms_def_policy_scope_4.png" /></p> 
<p>I can also use tags to include or exclude resources:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/fms_tags_for_policy_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Once I have defined the scope of my policy I click <strong>Next</strong> and review it, then click <strong>Create policy</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/fms_review_it_2.png" /></p> 
<p>Now that the policy is in force, the ALBs within its scope are initially noncompliant:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/fms_non_com_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Within minutes, <span title="">Firewall Manager</span> applies the policy and provides me with a status report:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/fms_applied_1.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Start Using AWS Firewall Manager Today</strong></span><br /> You can start using <span title="">AWS Firewall Manager</span> today!</p> 
<p>If you are using AWS Shield Advanced, you have access to AWS Firewall Manager and AWS WAF at no extra charge. If not, you are charged a monthly fee for each policy in each region, along with the usual charges for WAF WebACLs, WAF Rules, and AWS Config Rules.</p>

<p>As I have discussed in the past, sophisticated AWS customers invariably control multiple AWS accounts. Some of these are the results of acquisitions or a holdover from bottom-up, departmental adoption of cloud computing. Others create multiple accounts in order to isolate developers, projects, or departments from each other. We strongly endorse this as a best practice, and back it up with cross-account features in many AWS services, as well as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/" title="">AWS Organizations</a> for policy-based management that spans accounts. Many of these customers also make great use of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/config/" title="">AWS Config</a> and use Config Rules (both their own and those supplied by Config) to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-config-rules-dynamic-compliance-checking-for-cloud-resources/">check their AWS resources for compliance</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Aggregate Across Accounts and Regions</strong></span><br /> Today we are making Config Rules even more useful by adding the ability to aggregate the compliance data produced by their rules across multiple AWS accounts and/or Regions. The aggregated data can then be viewed in a single dashboard, making this a great way to improve governance and compliance. Even better, the aggregation and dashboard are available at no charge to all AWS Config users!</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/config_agg_splash_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I’ll show you how to set this up in a moment. First, let’s define a couple of terms:</p> 
<p><strong>Aggregator</strong> – This is a new Config resource. It identifies the sources (accounts and regions) of the compliance data to be aggregated. Multiple aggregators can be used simultaneously, giving you the ability to fine-tune your governance and compliance model.</p> 
<p><strong>Aggregator account</strong> – This is an AWS account that owns one or more aggregators.</p> 
<p><strong>Source account</strong> – This is an AWS account that has compliance data to be aggregated.</p> 
<p><strong>Aggregated view</strong> – A dashboard that shows compliant and non-compliant rules for an aggregator.</p> 
<p>Here’s how it all fits together:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/config_setup_1.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Setting up Aggregation</strong></span><br /> Let’s set up aggregation for some AWS Config data! The first steps take place in the aggregator account. I open the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/config/home">Config Console</a>, find the <strong>Aggregated View</strong> section and click <strong>Aggregators</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/config_side_bar_3.png" /></p> 
<p>I review the list of Aggregators, and click <strong>Add aggregator</strong> to make a new one:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/config_aggs_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I grant AWS Config permission to replicate data from the source accounts and enter a name for my aggregator (<strong>MyAgg</strong>):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/config_agg_perm_name_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Next, I select the source accounts. I have three options here: I can manually add the account IDs, upload a file that contains a comma-separated list, or add all of the accounts in my AWS Organization:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/config_add_accts_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I click on <strong>Add source accounts</strong> to manually add one account, enter the ID, and click <strong>Add source accounts</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/config_add_my_acct_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Next, I choose the regions of interest, with the option to select current regions as well as future ones, then click <strong>Save</strong> to move ahead:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/config_pick_regions_2.png" /></p> 
<p>The next step takes place in the source account, within the Config Console. An Authorization request appears:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/config_auth_request_1.png" /></p> 
<p>And I confirm it:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/config_auth_reply_ok_3.png" /></p> 
<p>You can use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/use-cloudformation-stacksets-to-provision-resources-across-multiple-aws-accounts-and-regions/">CloudFormation StackSets</a> to enable authorization programmatically across all source accounts. Also note that the authorization step is not needed if you choose to aggregate all accounts in your AWS Organization.</p> 
<p>Compliance data from the source account begins to flow to the aggregator account and becomes visible in the Console, generally within 2-5 minutes:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/config_agg_view_1.png" /></p> 
<p>As you can see, I have a multitude of filtering options! I can focus the view on a particular region or account, and I can see which rules or accounts have the most issues to address. For example, I can see all of the buckets that do not have server-side encryption enabled:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/config_s3_sse_not_there_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I can also look at the overall compliance situation for an account, seeing both compliant and non-compliant resources:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/config_see_acct_all_1.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Things to Know</strong></span><br /> This new feature is available today in the <span title="">US East (N.

<p>Today we’re launching AWS Secrets Manager which makes it easy to store and retrieve your secrets via API or the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a> and rotate your credentials with built-in or custom <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> functions. Managing application secrets like database credentials, passwords, or API Keys is easy when you’re working locally with one machine and one application. As you grow and scale to many distributed microservices, it becomes a daunting task to securely store, distribute, rotate, and consume secrets. Previously, customers&nbsp;needed to provision and maintain additional infrastructure solely for secrets management which&nbsp;could incur costs and introduce unneeded complexity into systems.</p> 
<h3>AWS Secrets Manager</h3> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/01/sm_1-1024x291.png" /></p> 
<p>Imagine that I have an application that takes incoming tweets from Twitter and stores them in an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/" title="">Amazon Aurora</a> database. Previously, I would have had to request a username and password from my database administrator and embed those credentials in environment variables or, in my race to production, even in the application itself. I would also need to have our social media manager create the Twitter API credentials and figure out how to store those. This is a fairly manual process, involving multiple people, that I have to restart every time I want to rotate these credentials. With Secrets Manager my database administrator can&nbsp;provide the credentials in secrets manager once and subsequently rely on a Secrets Manager provided Lambda function to automatically update and rotate those credentials. My social media manager can put the Twitter API keys in Secrets Manager which I can then access with a simple API call and I can even rotate these programmatically with a custom lambda function calling out to the Twitter API. My secrets are encrypted with the KMS key of my choice, and each of these administrators can explicitly grant access to these secrets with with granular IAM policies for individual roles or users.</p> 
<p>Let’s take a look at how I would store a secret using the AWS Secrets Manager console. First, I’ll click <strong>Store a new secret</strong> to get to the new secrets wizard. For my RDS Aurora instance it’s straightforward to simply select the instance and provide the initial username and password to connect to the database.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/sm_01-1024x967.png" /></p> 
<p>Next, I’ll fill in a quick description and a name to access my secret by. You can use whatever naming scheme you want here.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/sm_1-1-1024x632.png" /></p> 
<p>Next, we’ll configure rotation to use the Secrets Manager-provided Lambda function to rotate our password every 10 days.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/sm_configure-1024x794.png" /></p> 
<p>Finally, we’ll review all the details and check out our sample code for storing and retrieving our secret!</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/sample_code_sm-1024x967.png" /></p> 
<p>Finally I can review the secrets in the console.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/03/final_sm-1024x819.png" /></p> 
<p>Now, if I needed to access these secrets I’d simply call the API.</p> 
<code class="lang-python">import json
import boto3
secrets = boto3.client(&quot;secretsmanager&quot;)
rds = json.dumps(secrets.get_secrets_value(&quot;prod/TwitterApp/Database&quot;)['SecretString'])
print(rds)
</code> 
<p>Which would give me the following values:</p> 
<code class="lang-python">
{'engine': 'mysql',
'host': 'twitterapp2.abcdefg.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com',
'password': '-)Kw&gt;THISISAFAKEPASSWORD:lg{&amp;sad+Canr',
'port': 3306,
'username': 'ranman'}
</code> 
<h3>More than passwords</h3> 
<p>AWS Secrets Manager works for more than just passwords. I can store OAuth credentials, binary data, and more. Let’s look at storing my Twitter OAuth application keys.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/01/store_new_secert-1024x835.png" /></p> 
<p>Now, I can define the rotation for these third-party OAuth credentials with a custom AWS Lambda function that can call out to Twitter whenever we need to rotate our credentials.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/04/01/twitter_rotation-1024x731.png" /></p> 
<h3>Custom Rotation</h3> 
<p>One of the niftiest features of AWS Secrets Manager is custom AWS Lambda functions for credential rotation. This allows you to define completely custom workflows for credentials. Secrets Manager will call your lambda with a payload that includes a <code>Step</code> which specifies which step of the rotation you’re in, a <code>SecretId</code> which specifies which secret the rotation is for, and importantly a <code>ClientRequestToken</code> which is used to ensure idempotency in any changes to the underlying secret.</p> 
<p>When you’re rotating secrets you go through a few different steps:</p> 
<ol> 
<li><code>createSecret</code></li> 
<li><code>setSecret</code></li> 
<li><code>testSecret</code></li> 
<li><code>finishSecret</code></li> 
</ol> 
<p>The advantage of these steps is that you can add any kind of approval steps you want for each phase of the rotation. For more details on custom rotation check out the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html">documentation</a>.</p>

</footer> 
<p>I’ve got two big pieces of news for anyone who stores and retrieves data in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a>:</p> 
<p><strong>New S3 One Zone-IA Storage Class</strong> – This new storage class is 20% less expensive than the existing Standard-IA storage class. It is designed to be used to store data that does not need the extra level of protection provided by geographic redundancy.</p> 
<p><strong>General Availability of S3 Select</strong> – This unique retrieval option lets you retrieve subsets of data from S3 objects using simple SQL expressions, with the possibility for a 400% performance improvement in the process.</p> 
<p>Let’s take a look at both!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>S3 One Zone-IA (Infrequent Access) Storage Class</strong></span><br /> This new storage class stores data in a single AWS Availability Zone and is designed to provide eleven 9’s (99.99999999%) of data durability, just like the other S3 storage classes. Unlike those other classes, it is not designed to be resilient to the physical loss of an AZ due to major event such as an earthquake or a flood, and data could be lost in the unlikely event that an AZ is destroyed. S3 One Zone-IA storage gives you a lower cost option for secondary backups of on-premises data and for data that can be easily re-created. You can also use it as the target of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-cross-region-replication-for-amazon-s3/">S3 Cross-Region Replication</a> from another AWS region.</p> 
<p>You can specify the use of S3 One Zone-IA storage when you upload a new object to S3:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ozia_set_upload_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You can also make use of it as part of an S3 lifecycle rule:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ozia_lifecycle_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You can set up a lifecycle rule that moves previous versions of an object to S3 One Zone-IA after 30 or more days:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ozia_lifecycle_versioned_1.png" /></p> 
<p>And you can modify the storage class of an existing object:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ozia_stay_classy_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You can also manage storage classes using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectPUT.html">S3 API</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/index.html">CLI</a>, and CloudFormation templates.</p> 
<p>The S3 One Zone-IA storage class can be used in all public AWS regions. As I noted earlier, pricing is 20% lower than for the S3 Standard-IA storage class (see the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/">S3 Pricing</a> page for more info). There’s a 30 day minimum retention period, and a 128 KB minimum object size.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>General Availability of S3 Select</strong></span><br /> Randall wrote a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/s3-glacier-select/">detailed introduction to S3 Select</a> last year and showed you how you can use it to retrieve selected data from within S3 objects. During the preview we added support for server-side encryption and the ability to run queries from the S3 Console.</p> 
<p>I used a CSV file of airport codes to exercise the new console functionality:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/sel_airports_1.png" /></p> 
<p>This file contains listings for over 9100 airports, so it makes for useful test data but it definitely does not test the limits of S3 Select in any way. I select the file, open the <strong>More</strong> menu, and choose <strong>Select from</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/sel_pick_menu_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The console sets the file format and compression according to the file name and the encryption status. I set delimiter and click <strong>Show file preview</strong> to verify that my settings are correct. Then I click <strong>Next</strong> to proceed:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/sel_setup_tab_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I type SQL expressions in the SQL editor and click Run SQL to issue the query:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/sel_select_us_airports_2.png" /></p> 
<p>Or:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/sel_select_oz_airports_2.png" /></p> 
<p>I can also issue queries from the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/" title="">AWS SDKs</a>. I initiate the select operation:</p> 
<code class="lang-python">s3 = boto3.client('s3', region_name='us-west-2')
r = s3.select_object_content(
Bucket='jbarr-us-west-2',
Key='sample-data/airportCodes.csv',
ExpressionType='SQL',
Expression=&quot;select * from s3object s where s.\&quot;Country (Name)\&quot; like '%United States%'&quot;,
InputSerialization = {'CSV': {&quot;FileHeaderInfo&quot;: &quot;Use&quot;}},
OutputSerialization = {'CSV': {}},
)
</code> 
<p>And then I process the stream of results:</p> 
<code class="lang-python">for event in r['Payload']:
if 'Records' in event:
records = event['Records']['Payload'].decode('utf-8')
print(records)
elif 'Stats' in event:
statsDetails = event['Stats']['Details']
print(&quot;Stats details bytesScanned: &quot;)
print(statsDetails['BytesScanned'])
print(&quot;Stats details bytesProcessed: &quot;)
print(statsDetails['BytesProcessed'])</code> 
<p>S3 Select is available in all public regions and you can start using it today. Pricing is based on the amount of data scanned and the amount of data returned.</p>

Today we’re excited to make Amazon Transcribe generally available for all developers. Amazon Transcribe is an automatic speech recognition service (ASR) that makes it easy for developers to add speech to text capabilities to their applications. We’ve iterated on customer feedback in the preview to make a number of enhancements to Amazon Transcribe.</p> 
<h3>New Amazon Transcribe Features in GA</h3> 
<p>To start off we’ve made the <code>SampleRate</code> parameter optional which means you only need to know the file type of your media and the input language. We’ve added two new features – the ability to differentiate multiple speakers in the audio to provide more intelligible transcripts (“who spoke when”), and a custom vocabulary to improve the accuracy of speech recognition for product names, industry-specific terminology, or names of individuals. To refresh our memories on how Amazon Transcribe works lets look at a quick example. I’ll convert <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/randhunt-transcribe-demos/out.mp3">this audio</a> in my S3 bucket.</p> 
<code class="lang-python">import boto3
transcribe = boto3.client(&quot;transcribe&quot;)
transcribe.start_transcription_job(
TranscriptionJobName=&quot;TranscribeDemo&quot;,
LanguageCode=&quot;en-US&quot;,
MediaFormat=&quot;mp3&quot;,
Media={&quot;MediaFileUri&quot;: &quot;https://s3.amazonaws.com/randhunt-transcribe-demo-us-east-1/out.mp3&quot;}
)
</code> 
<p>This will output JSON similar to this (I’ve stripped out most of the response) with indidivudal speakers identified:</p> 
<code class="lang-json">{
&quot;jobName&quot;: &quot;reinvent&quot;,
&quot;accountId&quot;: &quot;1234&quot;,
&quot;results&quot;: {
&quot;transcripts&quot;: [
{
&quot;transcript&quot;: &quot;Hi, everybody, i'm randall ...&quot;
}
],
&quot;speaker_labels&quot;: {
&quot;speakers&quot;: 2,
&quot;segments&quot;: [
{
&quot;start_time&quot;: &quot;0.000000&quot;,
&quot;speaker_label&quot;: &quot;spk_0&quot;,
&quot;end_time&quot;: &quot;0.010&quot;,
&quot;items&quot;: []
},
{
&quot;start_time&quot;: &quot;0.010000&quot;,
&quot;speaker_label&quot;: &quot;spk_1&quot;,
&quot;end_time&quot;: &quot;4.990&quot;,
&quot;items&quot;: [
{
&quot;start_time&quot;: &quot;1.000&quot;,
&quot;speaker_label&quot;: &quot;spk_1&quot;,
&quot;end_time&quot;: &quot;1.190&quot;
},
{
&quot;start_time&quot;: &quot;1.190&quot;,
&quot;speaker_label&quot;: &quot;spk_1&quot;,
&quot;end_time&quot;: &quot;1.700&quot;
}
]
}
]
},
&quot;items&quot;: [
{
&quot;start_time&quot;: &quot;1.000&quot;,
&quot;end_time&quot;: &quot;1.190&quot;,
&quot;alternatives&quot;: [
{
&quot;confidence&quot;: &quot;0.9971&quot;,
&quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hi&quot;
}
],
&quot;type&quot;: &quot;pronunciation&quot;
},
{
&quot;alternatives&quot;: [
{
&quot;content&quot;: &quot;,&quot;
}
],
&quot;type&quot;: &quot;punctuation&quot;
},
{
&quot;start_time&quot;: &quot;1.190&quot;,
&quot;end_time&quot;: &quot;1.700&quot;,
&quot;alternatives&quot;: [
{
&quot;confidence&quot;: &quot;1.0000&quot;,
&quot;content&quot;: &quot;everybody&quot;
}
],
&quot;type&quot;: &quot;pronunciation&quot;
}
]
},
&quot;status&quot;: &quot;COMPLETED&quot;
}
</code> 
<h3>Custom Vocabulary</h3> 
<p>Now if I needed to have a more complex technical discussion with a colleague I could create a custom vocabulary. A custom vocabulary is specified as an array of strings passed to the <code>CreateVocabulary</code> API and you can include your custom vocabulary in a transcription job by passing in the name as part of the <code>Settings</code> in a <code>StartTranscriptionJob</code> API call. An individual vocabulary can be as large as 50KB and each phrase must be less than 256 characters. If I wanted to transcribe the recordings of my highschool AP Biology class I could create a custom vocabulary in Python like this:</p> 
<code class="lang-python">import boto3
transcribe = boto3.client(&quot;transcribe&quot;)
transcribe.create_vocabulary(
LanguageCode=&quot;en-US&quot;,
VocabularyName=&quot;APBiology&quot;
Phrases=[
&quot;endoplasmic-reticulum&quot;,
&quot;organelle&quot;,
&quot;cisternae&quot;,
&quot;eukaryotic&quot;,
&quot;ribosomes&quot;,
&quot;hepatocyes&quot;,
&quot;cell-membrane&quot;
]
)</code> 
<p>I can refer to this vocabulary later on by the name <code>APBiology</code> and update it programatically based on any errors I may find in the transcriptions.</p> 
<h3>Available Now</h3> 
<p>Amazon Transcribe is available now in <span title="">US East (N. Virginia)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, <span title="">US East (Ohio)</span> and <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span>. Transcribe’s free tier gives you 60 minutes of transcription for free per month for the first 12 months with a pay-as-you-go model of $0.0004 per second of transcribed audio after that, with a minimum charge of 15 seconds.</p> 
<p>When combined with other tools and services I think transcribe opens up a entirely new opportunities for application development. I’m excited to see what technologies developers build with this new service.</p>

Let’s take a quick look at the service in general availability.</p> 
<h3>Amazon Translate New Features</h3> 
<p>Since Tara’s post already covered the basics of the service I want to point out some of the new features of the service released today. Let’s start with a code sample:</p> 
<code class="lang-python">import boto3
translate = boto3.client(&quot;translate&quot;)
resp = translate.translate_text(
Text=&quot;🇫🇷 Je suis tr&egrave;s excit&eacute; pour Amazon Translate 🇫🇷&quot;,
SourceLanguageCode=&quot;auto&quot;,
TargetLanguageCode=&quot;en&quot;
)
print(resp['TranslatedText'])</code> 
<p>Since I have specified my source language as <code>auto</code>, Amazon Translate will call <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/" title="">Amazon Comprehend</a> on my behalf to determine the source language used in this text. If you couldn’t guess it, we’re writing some French and the output is <code>🇫🇷I'm very excited about Amazon Translate 🇫🇷</code>. You’ll notice that our emojis are preserved in the output text which is definitely a bonus feature for Millennials like me.</p> 
<p>The Translate console is a great way to get started and see some sample response.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/31/2018-03-31_16-03-15-1024x478.png" /></p> 
<p>Translate is extremely easy to use in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> functions which allows you to use it with almost any AWS service. There are a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/examples.html">number of examples</a> in the Translate documentation showing how to do everything from translate a web page to a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" title="">Amazon DynamoDB</a> table. Paired with other ML services like Amazon Comprehend and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/" title="">Amazon Transcribe</a> you can build everything from closed captioning to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/examples-twitch.html">real-time chat translation</a> to a robust text analysis pipeline for call centers transcriptions and other textual data.</p> 
<h3>New Languages Coming Soon</h3> 
<p>Today, Amazon Translate allows you to translate text to or from English, to any of the following languages: Arabic, Chinese (Simplified), French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish. We’ve announced support for additional languages coming soon: Japanese (go <a href="https://jaws-ug.jp/">JAWSUG</a>), Russian, Italian, Chinese (Traditional), Turkish, and Czech.</p> 
<p>Amazon Translate can also be used to increase professional translator efficiency, and reduce costs and turnaround times for their clients. We’ve already partnered with a number of Language Service Providers (LSPs) to offer their customers end-to-end translation services at a lower cost by allowing Amazon Translate to produce a high-quality draft translation that’s then edited by the LSP for a guaranteed human quality result.</p> 
<p>I’m excited to see what applications our customers are able to build with high quality machine translation just one API call away.</p>

<p>Amazon SageMaker continues to iterate quickly and release new features on behalf of customers. Starting today, SageMaker adds support for many new instance types, local testing with the SDK, and Apache MXNet 1.1.0 and Tensorflow 1.6.0. Let’s take a quick look at each of these updates.</p> 
<h3>New Instance Types</h3> 
<p>Amazon SageMaker customers now have additional options for right-sizing their workloads for notebooks, training, and hosting. Notebook instances now support almost all T2, M4, P2, and P3 instance types with the exception of t2.micro, t2.small, and m4.large instances. Model training now supports nearly all M4, M5, C4, C5, P2, and P3 instances with the exception of m4.large, c4.large, and c5.large instances. Finally, model hosting now supports nearly all T2, M4, M5, C4, C5, P2, and P3 instances with the exception of m4.large instances. Many customers can take advantage of the newest P3, C5, and M5 instances to get the best price/performance for their workloads. Customers also take advantage of the burstable compute model on T2 instances for endpoints or notebooks that are used less frequently.</p> 
<h3>Open Sourced Containers, Local Mode, and TensorFlow 1.6.0 and MXNet 1.1.0</h3> 
<p>Today Amazon SageMaker has open sourced the <a href="https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-mxnet-containers">MXNet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-tensorflow-containers">Tensorflow</a> deep learning containers that power the <a href="https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk#mxnet-sagemaker-estimators">MXNet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk#tensorflow-sagemaker-estimators">Tensorflow</a> estimators in the SageMaker SDK. The ability to write Python scripts that conform to simple interface is still one of my favorite SageMaker features and now those containers can be additionally customized to include any additional libraries. You can download these containers locally to iterate and experiment which can accelerate your debugging cycle. When you’re ready go from local testing to production training and hosting you just change one line of code.</p> 
<p>These containers launch with support for Tensorflow 1.6.0 and MXNet 1.1.0 as well. Tensorflow has a number of new 1.6.0 features including support for CUDA 9.0, cuDNN 7, and AVX instructions which allows for significant speedups in many training applications. MXNet 1.1.0 adds a number of new features including a Text API <a href="https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/contrib/text.html"><code>mxnet.text</code></a> with support for text processing, indexing, glossaries, and more. Two of the really cool pre-trained embeddings included are <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/">GloVe</a> and <a href="https://fasttext.cc/">fastText</a>.<br /> &lt;</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> All of the features mentioned above are available today. As always please let us know on Twitter or in the comments below if you have any questions or if you’re building something interesting. Now, if you’ll excuse me I’m going to go experiment with some of those new MXNet APIs!</p>
