<p>Informatica’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/informatica-eic/">Enterprise Data Catalog (EDC) Quick Start</a> deploys the artificial intelligence-powered data catalog on the AWS Cloud. EDC enables organizations to discover and catalog assets along with their relationships from data sources across the enterprise. Assets are data objects such as tables, columns, reports, views, and schemas, and may exist in relational databases, purpose-built applications, business intelligence tools, and big data systems.</p> 
<p>EDC scans data sources to capture physical and operational metadata for your data assets, which helps you make critical decisions on data integration, data quality, and data governance.</p> 
<p><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/informatica-eic/">See the Informatica EDC Quick Start &gt;&gt;</a></strong></p> 
<p>Informatica’s EDC allows both IT and business to discover and explore their data assets and maximize the value from them.</p> 
<p>Other benefits include:</p> 
<li><strong>Machine learning-based discovery engine:</strong> Automatically catalog and classify all types of data across the enterprise using an AI-powered catalog.</li> 
<li><strong>Data lineage and impact analysis:</strong> Interactively trace data origin through business-friendly summarized lineage views that highlight the end points.</li> 
<li><strong>360-degree relationship discovery:</strong> View data in a knowledge graph that lets customers quickly search, discover, and understand enterprise data and meaningful data relationships.</li> 
<li><strong>Powerful search engine:</strong> Find data assets through powerful semantic search.</li> 
<li><strong>Building block for data lake:</strong> EDC acts as a building block for customers considering building a data lake on AWS.</li> 
<b>Additional Resources</b> 
<p>AWS and Informatica offer a 30-day EDC trial to customers. <a href="https://marketplace.informatica.com/product-services!input.jspa?pcode=eic">Learn more and register here &gt;&gt;</a></p>

<p>Kicking off the new year, we see&nbsp;many Amazon Web Services (AWS) Partners doing great things and innovating on the AWS Cloud. <strong>Veeam</strong> is bringing backup technology to the cloud; while <strong>IOpipe</strong> helps you get better insight into your AWS Lambda functions; and <strong>Narrative Science</strong> uses machine learning to generate auto reports from your big data.</p> 
<p>These are just a few of the innovations being driven by members of the AWS Partner Network (APN), the global partner program for AWS that is focused on helping APN Partners build successful AWS-based businesses or solutions. As an APN Partner, organizations receive business, technical, sales, and marketing resources to help you grow your business and better support your customers.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Veeam%20Software&amp;id=001E000000VKFVzIAP"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/22/Veeam-Logo-150x150.jpg" /></a>One of the challenges with migrating to the cloud is finding a backup strategy that works for servers that are not physically present in datacenters. How do you perform full-server backups of virtual instances? How do you do it efficiently, securely, and on a schedule that matches your business requirements?</p> 
<p>Through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Veeam%20Software&amp;id=001E000000VKFVzIAP">Veeam</a>, an&nbsp;AWS Advanced Technology Partner, customers can leverage the Veeam Backup &amp; Replication data protection solution to protect <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) instances regardless of Region or Availability Zone. Customers using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vmware/">VMware Cloud on AWS</a>&nbsp;also have full support (as of version 9.5 Update 3) for migrated VMware instances, providing a single solution to protect both virtual and on-premises workloads running on VMware vSphere.</p> 
<p>Regardless of where data is stored, organizations get direct access to Veeam’s suite of powerful features like file-level recovery, change block tracking, and innovative scheduling options, such as reverse incremental backups where the most recent backup will always be a full backup. In addition, data stored in Veeam supports both deduplication and compression so you can optimize storage cost versus performance. There are no special filesystem or hardware requirements for the storage used.</p> 
<p>To ensure backup activity does not negatively impact network bandwidth,&nbsp;Veeam has the ability to configure network throttling rules to limit transfer rates. For out-of-region backups where bandwidth may be even more limited, Veeam can optimize WAN connections using a special WAN Accelerator service. Regardless of how data is transferred, the security of your data is paramount. All backups are encrypted both at-rest and in-flight. Data transfers are done via TLS with AES-256, and the underlying block storage files are encrypted as soon as they arrive at the backup server, once more using AES-256.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 1 – When it comes to file or system recovery, Veeam offers a wide range of powerful explorers to visualize your backups so you can easily tell what you are restoring.</em></p> 
<p>For customers looking for high durability and low-cost object storage as an offsite backup of their on-premise storage, Veeam also provides an easy-to-implement interface to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/">Amazon Storage Gateway</a>. This tool enables organizations to eliminate legacy backup solutions like tape, by providing seamless access to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/">Amazon S3 Standard – Infrequent Access</a> (Standard – IA)&nbsp;and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/">Amazon Glacier</a>, making it easy and cost effective to move long term archive into the cloud.</p>

<b>IOpipe: Get Better Insight into Your AWS Lambda Functions</b> 
<p><em>By Ian Scofield, Partner Solutions Architect at AWS</em></p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=IOpipe&amp;id=001E000001eO9MLIA0"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/22/IOpipe-Logo-150x150.jpg">serverless applications</a> on top of AWS due to a large number of benefits, ranging from the reduced operational overhead to the ability to scale effortlessly. As with any application, though, it’s important you have monitoring to ensure it is performing as expected.</p> 
<p>Monitoring an application whose compute architecture runs on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> is different than one that is running on an Amazon EC2 instance. Metrics such as function duration and memory usage allow you to “right-size” your functions and establish performance baselines. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">Amazon CloudWatch</a> provides logging and monitoring capabilities for your Lambda functions, but <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=IOpipe&amp;id=001E000001eO9MLIA0">IOpipe</a>, an AWS Advanced Technology Partner with AWS Lambda Service Delivery Designation, provides a solution that extends the functionality provided by CloudWatch by giving you even more visibility into the execution of your Lambda functions.</p> 
<p>Developers&nbsp;can integrate IOpipe into Lambda functions by adding their <a href="https://github.com/iopipe/iopipe">open source module</a>, which currently supports Node.js and Python execution environments. Once added, it sends telemetry and other detailed information back to the IOpipe service, which gives you the ability to monitor the performance of the function in near real-time. It also provides you with common information such as memory consumed, duration, and number of invocations, and reports cold starts which are not currently exposed in CloudWatch.</p> 
<p>In addition to the metrics reported on your functions, IOpipe ingests execution traces, errors, and custom metrics to give you a complete picture of how your application is performing. This information is then aggregated, allowing you to search through millions, even billions, of invocations quickly for things like “Find invocations that have errors in the last 15 minutes,” or “Find invocations that were a cold start,” or “Find invocations for a function that were slower than expected.” You can combine search parameters to answer even more specific situations like “Show me the invocations from user Iceman where the write to DynamoDB is greater than 1000ms.”</p> 
<p>Capturing the metrics concerning your functions is important, but knowing what’s going on inside and how you can further optimize your code is even more important. Due to Lambda’s billing model of 100ms blocks, shaving off time has&nbsp;performance implications and financial ones as well. IOpipe recently <a href="https://read.iopipe.com/using-iopipe-profiling-to-gain-crucial-observability-into-your-aws-lambda-functions-506f5dda6bdf">launched a new feature</a> which allows you to profile your Node.js functions. Profiling allows you to analyze how your code is performing and helps you identify areas that can be optimized by stepping through line by line. As you can see in <em>Figure 2</em>, profiling allows you to analyze how your code is performing and helps you identify areas that can be optimized by stepping through line by line and seeing the impact on the overall function.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/23/IOpipe-Profiling.gif" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 2 – A flame graph generated by using the profile data of an AWS Lambda Invocation.</em></p> 
<p>IOpipe makes it significantly easier to debug production applications and squeeze every last bit of performance out of your AWS Lambda functions.</p>

<b>Narrative Science: Using&nbsp;Natural Language Generation to Automatically Build&nbsp;Reports from Data</b> 
<p><em>By Pratap Ramamurthy, Partner Solutions Architect at AWS</em></p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Narrative%20Science"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/22/Narrative-Science-Logo-150x150.jpg">Narrative Science</a>&nbsp;takes this quite literally.&nbsp;Imagine you have a graph or chart representing a dataset, but its meaning is not obvious at first.</p> 
<p>Narrative Science, which holds the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/partner-solutions/">AWS Machine Learning Competency</a>,&nbsp;provides Natural Language Generation (NLG) software in a platform called <a href="https://narrativescience.com/Platform">Quill</a>,&nbsp;or by integrating narratives to other products or platforms via their Dynamic Narratives offering. Dynamic Narratives can help by adding a narrative, in English,&nbsp;to this chart based on insights automatically derived from the data.</p> 
<p>This, and other use cases like it, is inspiring rapid adoption of NLG. A good example&nbsp;is business intelligence (BI) software, which companies use to derive insights from data by generating charts and graphs. The financial services industry deals with enormous amounts of data&nbsp;that needs to be summarized in reports. Generating these reports can be time consuming but could also be automated using NLG. Moreover, some financial compliance implications can be solved with transparent and consistent reporting that is traceable back to the system of record.</p> 
<p>Another example is credit card customers who want&nbsp;to gain insights on their monthly transactions. It is near impossible&nbsp;for a human to write a personalized report for each and every customer. Instead, this can be automated using NLG to save both time and money while also creating value for the end-customer.</p> 
<p>Not all NLG technologies are the same, however. NLGs can be broadly classified into three categories:</p> 
<li><strong>Basic NLG:</strong> This technology converts numbers into text or takes names from a database and inserts them into an email body.</li> 
<li><strong>Templatized NLG:</strong> Here, the user is responsible for writing templates, determining how to join ideas and interpreting the output.</li> 
<li><strong>Advanced NLG:</strong> Advanced NLG communicates the way humans do—assessing the data to identify what is important and interesting to a specific audience, then automatically transforming those insights into intelligent narratives. The result is insightful communications packed with audience-relevant information, written in conversational language.</li> 
<p>Narrative Science’s Quill is an advanced NLG technology that provides realistic, relevant, and accurate narratives. Quill is flexible in ways that allows you fit narratives to your needs. For example, you can choose either a paragraph narrative or bulleted list, short, or verbose narrative. <em>Figure 3</em> shows sample data for a narrative generated for a bar chart in Tableau.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/07/Narratives-for-Tableau-Screenshot-1024x536.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 3 – Narrative Science’s Quill is an advanced NLG technology that provides realistic, relevant, and accurate narratives. This is sample data for a narrative generated for a bar chart in Tableau.</em></p> 
<p>Quill is a SaaS platform that runs on AWS, and Dynamic Narratives can be accessed through the <a href="https://narrativescience.com/narratives-for-bi-api-trial">Narrative Science API</a>. You can send data in JSON, XML, or CSV, and the response will contain the narrative text. The time taken depends on the amount of text sent, but it is usually near-instant.</p> 
<p>Narrative Science can also integrate with third-party software and applications via their Dynamic Narratives offering. Dynamic Narratives leverages the core authoring engine of Quill to integrate with data and analytics platforms such as Tableau, Microstrategy, and Qlik. Going beyond partnering with visualization tools, Narrative Science has partnered with <a href="https://www.sisense.com/">Sisense Everywhere</a>, a BI tool, to create a conversational chat bot that can be accessed using an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-70vk93bGU">Amazon Echo</a> device. With this feature, you can ask questions about a dataset that is received by Sisense and uses Narrative Science to generate an answer. <a href="https://narrativescience.com/Resources/Resource-Library/Article-Detail-Page/sisense-narrative-science-collaborate-on-sisense-everywhere">See a&nbsp;demo</a> of how Dynamic Narratives can be embedded into other data and analytics platforms via API.</p> 
<p>You can <a href="https://narrativescience.com/narratives-for-bi-api-trial">access a trial</a> of the Dynamic Narratives API,&nbsp;or use it through your favorite BI tool&nbsp;that is&nbsp;<a href="https://narrativescience.com/Partners/Partner-Network/Narratives-for-BI">already integrated</a>.</p>

<p>This version reflects our most recent program criteria, with improvements focused on raising the bar for both our MSP Partner and Amazon Web Services (AWS) customer experiences. It also reflects feedback from the MSP Partner community and our audit team.</p> 
<p><a href="http://partnercentral.awspartner.com/sfc/#version?selectedDocumentId=0690L000003ivJ9"><strong>Download the AWS MSP Partner Program Validation Checklist v3.2 &gt;&gt;</strong></a></p> 
<b>What is the AWS MSP Partner Program?</b> 
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/managed-service/">AWS MSP Partner Program</a> was developed out of AWS customers’ requests to help them identify APN Partners who could help them migrate, run, and optimize their AWS workloads. The program was thus created to align customers with a set of validated next-generation APN Partners who could deliver this full experience: plan/design &gt;&gt; build/migrate &gt;&gt; run &gt;&gt; optimize.</p> 
<p>In addition to a robust set of requirements, the MSP Partner Program also incorporates the use of a third-party validation audit that brings value to both the participating APN Partners&nbsp;and to AWS customers who can confidently identify qualified MSP Partners.</p> 
<b>What’s New or Different in Version 3.2?</b> 
<p>The focus of the changes from v3.1 to v3.2 has been clarifying, simplifying, and improving the MSP Partner experience. A streamlined Renewal Audit process was introduced in v3.1, and v3.2 further incorporates a Renewal Audit Waiver option for eligible MSP Partners.</p> 
<h3>The full list of changes are:</h3> 
<li>Updated Annual Renewal Audit process and details (see Audit Process &amp; Timing)</li> 
<li>Added Renewal Audit Waiver Option (see Audit Process &amp; Timing)</li> 
<li>Added Impact of Merger, Acquisition &amp; Divestiture Activity (see Audit Process &amp; Timing)</li> 
<li>Added definitions for Reference and Case Study (see Definitions)</li> 
<li>Updated and clarified acceptable evidence for 1.6, 2.2, 4.5, 7.x, 8.1.10, 8.1.11, and 10.x</li> 
<li>Added AWS Services to 3.1—Amazon Aurora, AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS), Amazon GuardDuty, AWS CloudHSM, AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), and AWS Systems Manager</li> 
<li>Updated references to Detailed Billing Report to now reflect Cost &amp; Usage Report</li> 
<li>Updated references and link to APN Portal that now points to APN Partner Central</li> 
<li>Updated evidence requirements for 9.6.1, 9.6.2, and 9.6.3 to specify case studies, in place of use cases (see Definitions)</li> 
<li>Removed section 12.0 Service Reporting and consolidated these items into a single requirement—9.14 Customer Reports</li> 
<li>Removed DevOps requirements from section 9 and moved to section 10.0 DevOps</li> 
<li>Moved section 14.0 SLA Optimization to 11.3</li> 
<li>Provided automatic credit for sections 7.0 Infrastructure&nbsp;&amp; Application Migration Capabilities and 10.0 DevOps for Partners who hold the relevant AWS Competencies (see sections 7.0 and 10.0 for details)</li> 
<p>APN Partners entering the program, or MSP Partners renewing their program status, will be required to use Version 3.2 of the Validation Checklist for all audits as of April 1, 2018.</p>

Cadence produces software, hardware, and silicon structures that are used to design integrated circuits, systems on chips (SoCs), and printed circuit boards.</p> 
<p>Cadence originally ran their own datacenters, but as the enterprise expanded&nbsp;they began to outgrow the computing capacity of the on-premises system. Their team understood prior to moving to the cloud the implications of securing a cloud environment as it scales. They sought to automate as many security tasks as possible while still proving to customers that their environment met high compliance industry standards, and that the security policies they created would be enforced.</p> 
<p>Cadence looked to Amazon Web Services (AWS) Advanced Technology Partner <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Dome9%20Security&amp;id=001E000000Rp584IAB">Dome9 Security</a>&nbsp;to build a system that would enable the company to scale up quickly, efficiently, and flexibly in response to large customer orders.&nbsp;Dome9 is one of the fastest growing born-in-the-cloud security startups fully hosted on AWS, and their Dome9 Arc platform delivers agentless software-as-a-service (SaaS) cloud security and compliance automation, advanced identity and access management (IAM) protection, and active protection for enterprises as they scale their AWS footprint.</p> 
<p><strong><a href="https://dome9.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Dome9-Cadence-Case-Study.pdf">Read the full Cadence-Dome9 case study &gt;&gt;</a></strong></p> 
<b>The Solution</b> 
<p>Cadence selected Dome9,&nbsp;which holds <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/" target="null">AWS Competencies</a> in <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/partner-solutions/" target="null">Security</a> and <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/networking/partner-solutions/" target="null">Networking</a>, to provide network security management and automated compliance. The Dome9 Arc platform has a&nbsp;deep visualization tool, Dome9 Clarity, which provides a granular view of customers’ AWS Cloud assets–Cadence has 770 security groups, 1,000 <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) instances, and 115 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a>&nbsp;(Amazon VPC) environments with real-time alerts in cases of misconfigurations.</p> 
<b>The Results</b> 
<p>With consolidated control over 50 AWS accounts in 3 AWS regions created by Dome9, Cadence can easily set up access for production teams, training sessions, and customers’ DevOps teams to specific subnets using Dome9 Dynamic Access Leases. These leases provide time-limited access to ports and services and immediately revert a port to closed once the lease has expired. Additionally, Cadence uses Dome9 active protection to enforce established security policies and keep regional data from being accessed by anyone outside of the defined region.</p> 
<p>Dome9’s network security management and automated compliance provides Cadence with many benefits:</p> 
<li><strong>Lower costs and accelerated time-to-market for products</strong>. Without Dome9, Cadence would have to spend an estimated $450,000 more annually on personnel and training.</li> 
<li><strong>Increased efficiency and agility</strong> allows their team to focus on higher level tasks.</li> 
<li><strong>Dome9’s robust platform is certified for ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type 2 compliance</strong>, in addition to providing continuous end-to-end compliance testing and reporting against industry standards and over 500 best practices. This allows Cadence to reassure customers that they are doing everything possible to keep their applications and data safe.</li>

<p>Analysts at C4ADS monitor worldwide events for patterns that warrant a&nbsp;deeper investigation, and their challenge was compounded by having to&nbsp;comb through a growing dataset that included data from different formats and sources.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=ClearScale&amp;id=001E000000Rl0wKIAR">ClearScale</a>, an AWS Premier Consulting Partner, reviewed various designs and approaches it could develop and implement on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to make the data more user-friendly for C4ADS analysts. The solution had to be implemented quickly, scale as needed, and be extremely secure given the nature of the information.</p> 
<p>To meet these requirements, ClearScale—which holds <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/">AWS Competencies</a> in Big Data, DevOps, Marketing &amp; Commerce, Mobile, Migration, and Internet of Things (IoT)—implemented a data lake approach within an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a> (Amazon VPC). The biggest challenge was aggregating multiple file formats (PDFs, emails, Microsoft Word and Excel files, logs, XML and JSON files) while still allowing C4ADS to perform easy searches within a large data repository. Unlike traditional data warehouse methodologies, a data lake allows for any number of data types to be stored and referenced as long as those types have a consistent approach to querying and retrieving data.</p> 
<p>Launched in October 2017, ClearScale’s solution has already optimized the analysts’ jobs by allowing them to do wide-ranging searches and aggregate disparate data types. Later releases will introduce more robust security measures, multi-lingual support, and optical character recognition (OCR) technology to aid in identification of important data markers.</p>

<p><em>By Aarthi Raju, Partner Solutions Architect at AWS</em></p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vmware/">VMware Cloud on AWS</a> enables customers to extend their on-premises data centers and easily migrate application workloads without having to convert machine image formats or undergo a re-platforming process.</p> 
<p>Customers no longer have to over-provision hardware resources to accommodate for host failures. Instead, you can increase utilization of the cluster resources as host failure replacement takes minutes, not days or weeks. You can also take advantage of instant on-demand capacity to meet temporary, seasonal, or unplanned demand by dynamically adding hosts to the cluster. With the recent VMware launch of Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) with VMware Site Recovery, customers can accelerate time-to-protection, simplify disaster recovery operations, and reduce the expense of maintaining additional physical data centers.</p> 
<p>VMware Cloud on AWS enables customers to run the VMware Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) stack, which includes vSphere, vSAN, NSX, and vCenter directly on bare-metal AWS infrastructure while maintaining the elasticity and security that customers demand. Customers can use their existing VMware skills while taking full advantage of running VMware workloads in the cloud.</p> 
<p>In this post, we dive deeper into the foundational blocks that make up this service.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/02/VMware-Architecture.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 1 – Overview of the foundational blocks of VMware Cloud on AWS. </em></p> 
<b>Compute</b> 
<p>An SDDC cluster can contain up to 10 vSphere clusters ranging in size from 4 to 32 hosts. Each host is configured with 512GB of memory and contains dual CPU sockets that are populated by a custom-built Intel Xeon Processor E5-2686 v4 CPU package. Each of these hosts contains 18 cores per socket (36 cores total with 72 threads per host) for a cluster core count of 144. Users can add or remove hosts with a simple click of a button or through an API call.</p> 
<b>Storage</b> 
<p>The primary storage for the SDDC cluster is backed by VMware’s vSAN (Virtual SAN) in an all-flash configuration. Each ESXi host comes with NVMe flash storage. A minimal 4 ESXi host cluster running vSAN provides approximately 21 TB usable storage, with all virtual machines protected against a single host failure (FTT=1). Data encryption at rest is built-in, without any user intervention. Users can leverage VMware’s SPBM (Storage Policy Based Management) VM storage policies at individual vdisk level.</p> 
<b>Networking</b> 
<p>VMware NSX is the network virtualization platform that enables customers to create a multi-tier virtual network. It allows customers to de-couple the network functions from the physical devices. In VMware Cloud on AWS, customers can use NSX to create their own logical networks. For every cluster, there are two logical networks by default–one for the management workloads and one for compute workloads.</p> 
<p>Communication between logical networks is achieved using gateways. The Management Gateway (MGW) utilizes VMware NSX Edge to enable users to connect to the vCenter Server instance. Customers can configure firewall rules, create IPSEC VPN and DNS for the management gateway. The Customer Gateway (CGW) utilizes a NSX Edge instance and a distributed logical router (DLR) to enable ingress and egress of VM network traffic.</p> 
<b>Connectivity</b> 
<p>The gateways discussed also enable connectivity from the SDDC cluster to on-premises environments. An IPSEC layer 3 VPN can be set up to securely connect the on-premise vCenter server with the management components running in the cloud SDDC cluster that enables capability such as hybrid linked mode for unified management. A separate layer 3 IPSEC VPN is set up to create connectivity between the on-premises workloads and VMs running in the cloud SDDC cluster.</p> 
<p>Customers can also leverage their existing AWS Direct Connect connection with VMware Cloud on AWS. This can be done by creating a hosted private Virtual Interface (VIF) for VMware Cloud on AWS. Currently, VMkernel traffic (ESX Management and vMotion) is carried over the private VIF. For all other traffic (management appliance traffic and workload VM traffic), customers can use the VPN connection already established.</p> 
<b>High Availability</b> 
<p>VMware vSphere High Availability (HA) provides high availability for VMs by leveraging hosts and resources of a cluster to reserve capacity. This way, workloads can failover in case of host failures. In the event of a failure, VMs on failed hosts are restarted on alternative hosts. VMware takes responsibility and will perform host failure remediation.</p> 
<b>Hybrid Linked Mode (HLM)</b> 
<p>A single pane of glass to view and manage on-premises as well as cloud environments is provided through vCenter Hybrid Linked Mode (HLM). This allows you to link the VMware Cloud on AWS vCenter to your on-premises vCenter to provide a hybrid management interface across cloud and on-premises resources. To take advantage of this feature, users need to be running vSphere 6.5 or later versions.</p> 
<b>Additional Resources</b> 
<p>VMware Cloud on AWS is delivered, sold, and supported by VMware as an on-demand, elastically-scalable cloud service that removes barriers to cloud migration and cloud portability, increases IT efficiency, and opens up new opportunities to leverage a hybrid cloud environment.&nbsp;The service is currently available in the AWS US West (Oregon), US East (N. Virginia), and London Regions.</p>
