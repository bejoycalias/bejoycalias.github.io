<p><strong><em>By Tom Staab, Partner Solutions Architect at AWS</em></strong></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/14/Microsoft-Competency-Icon-1-300x150.png" />This past week in Seattle, more than 5,000 people attended the annual PASS Summit conference, and AWS was well represented. Once again, AWS had a large booth in the exhibit hall, and hundreds of people stopped by over the three-day event. Several technical sessions provided insight for running Microsoft SQL Server workloads on Amazon Web Services (AWS), and the AWS Partner Network (APN) co-sponsored a breakfast with over 150 attendees.</p> 
<p>You may have read in Jeff Barr’s recent article on the AWS News Blog that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-microsoft-sql-server-2017-for-amazon-ec2/">Microsoft launched its SQL Server 2017</a>, which then became available on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in all regions shortly after. That means the latest version of Microsoft SQL Server is now available with the security, scalability, performance, and flexibility of Amazon EC2.</p> 
<p>Running Microsoft SQL Server 2017 on AWS enables you to benefit from its new features such as graph databases, automatic database tuning, and clusterless Always On availability groups. All of this while leveraging the high availability and disaster recovery capabilities of AWS with low latency connectivity between all AWS Availability Zones (AZs) .</p> 
<p>This is just one example of the many innovations that help customers run Microsoft SQL Server workloads on AWS. In May, AWS released a new Quick Start featuring <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/sios-datakeeper/">SIOS DataKeeper Cluster Edition</a> from Advanced APN Technology Partner SIOS, making it even easier to implement Microsoft SQL Server failover cluster instances on Amazon EC2. In August, the maximum storage capacity for Amazon Relationship Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances running Microsoft SQL Server was increased from 4 TB to 16 TB, and the potential IOPS was increased fivefold. And just last week, Amazon RDS for Microsoft SQL Server gained the ability to reconfigure the volume type and Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) upon snapshot restore.</p> 
<p>All Microsoft SQL Server versions integrate with AWS services including <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">Amazon CloudWatch</a> (to monitor operations and performance), <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/run-command/">Amazon EC2 Run Command</a> (to remotely manage instances), and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/">Amazon Elastic Block Store</a> (to take advantage of the persistent, performance, and reliable storage). This helps provide you with easy management, monitoring, and other administrative tasks.</p> 
<h3>Learn More About Microsoft SQL Server on AWS</h3> 
<p>For more information on how AWS services contribute to improved performance, security, and availability of Microsoft SQL Server applications, we invite you to join us at our <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/">AWS re:Invent 2017 conference</a>, November 27 through December 1 in Las Vegas.</p> 
<h3>Leveraging the AWS Competency Program for Microsoft Workloads</h3> 
<p>In July, we announced Microsoft SQL Server will be represented in a new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/aws-microsoft-workloads-competency-now-includes-database-solutions/">Database Solutions category</a> of our AWS Microsoft Workloads Competency. This allows customers to easily identify and engage the right APN Partners.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/">AWS Competency Program</a> is valuable to APN Partners as a way to demonstrate proficiency, and it is an important vehicle for customers to find APN Partners with the knowledge and experience they need. There are currently 12 APN Partners in the Microsoft Workloads Competency Database Solutions category, and several others have begun the approval process.</p> 
<p>We appreciate the dedication and hard work of our Microsoft Workloads Competency APN Partners and continue to look for Advanced and Premier APN Partners with experience implementing Microsoft SQL Server on AWS to join this elite group. Check out the AWS Microsoft Workloads Competency site&nbsp;if you are a customer or APN Partner looking to work with an APN Partner who has already earned the competency.</p> 
<h3>Proven Success with Microsoft SQL Server Workloads</h3> 
<p>The new&nbsp;Microsoft SQL Server launch means customers will be considering upgrades, and APN Partners that have earned the competency play an important role in helping you with these projects.</p> 
<p>In their own words, here are some success stories from APN Partners who have delivered Microsoft SQL projects:</p>

<p><strong><em>By Judah Bernstein, Partner Solutions Architect at AWS focused on SaaS</em></strong></p> 
<p>Identity is a fundamental design decision that software as a service (SaaS) architects must consider when developing a multi-tenant system. Developers who are building SaaS applications must be able to identify a user, the tenant associated with the user, the user’s permissions, and the relationship a tenant has with the provider, such as usage plan or tier.</p> 
<p>In this post for SaaS Technology Partners, I will explore how to architect a multi-tenant system and identify tenant context and role using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a>, which lets you easily add user sign-up and sign-in to your mobile and web apps.</p> 
<p>I’ll first describe how to introduce tenant context into a multi-tenant application, and then define custom attributes and claims. Finally, I’ll present a few design considerations and show you how to take advantage of custom attributes within a multi-tenant system.</p> 
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/09/Amazon-Cognito-overview.png" /></a> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 1 – Amazon Cognito lets you focus on creating great app experiences instead of worrying about building, securing, and scaling a solution to handle user management, authentication, and synchronization across devices.</em></p> 
<h3><strong>Introducing Tenant Context into Amazon Cognito</strong></h3> 
<p>To secure and isolate multiple tenants within a SaaS application, you must inject tenant context into applications or infrastructure. Tenant context may consist of a customer (tenant) identifier, usage plan, user identifier, and application role. This allows an application to programmatically adjust to the agreement with the customer, scope the access of resources to the corresponding customer, and constrain the customer to the permissions defined by the application role.</p> 
<p>You can inject SaaS applications with tenant context in myriad ways. One approach is to inject it into the token obtained following a sign-in to an identity provider. Amazon Cognito user pools provide you with an identity provider so you can introduce tenant context. This allows you to architect the application to be stateless, scalable, and secure.</p> 
<p>Amazon Cognito also lets you add user sign-up and sign-in to mobile and web applications with a dedicated login using custom credentials, such as an email address and password. User pools provide a cost-effective, secure, highly available, and durable user directory that stores a collection of user profiles with standard and custom attributes. You can define these attributes by using key-value pairs, and then use these attributes within the application or infrastructure to regulate access control and maintain tenant context.</p> 
<h3><strong>Standard Attributes and Claims</strong></h3> 
<p>Amazon Cognito has a set of built-in standard attributes that match the attributes provided by the <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims">OpenID Connect (OIDC) specifications</a>, such as <span style="font-family: courier">given_name</span>, <span style="font-family: courier">family_name</span>, <span style="font-family: courier">email</span>, and <span style="font-family: courier">birthdate</span>. These attributes are key-value pairs associated with a user profile.</p> 
<p>Standard attributes limit the independent software vendor’s (ISV’s) ability to meet the requirements of a multi-tenant system. For example, defining a tenant simply by their email domain may result in challenges if you’re supporting multiple business units within an enterprise organization, or may prohibit a subsidiary of an enterprise from obtaining access to tenant data.</p> 
<p>To bind tenant context, you should introduce custom attributes within the context of the authentication and authorization mechanism. Defining custom attributes within a user profile allows you to inject key-value pairs into an application, and supports the extensibility and identification of tenant context.</p> 
<h3><strong>JSON Web Token and Authorization Claims</strong></h3> 
<p>You can obtain tenant context by decoding key-value pairs that were injected into a secure authorization token, generated and signed by Amazon Cognito. This <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">JSON Web Token</a> (JWT) is issued and signed by a centralized server after a user is authenticated with their user name and password, as shown in <em>Figure 2</em>.</p> 
<p>The issued token’s key-value pairs are claims obtained from profile attributes, which include details of the issuing provider. This may include details on the identity such as the user’s <span style="font-family: courier">given_name</span>, and custom claims such as the defined key-value pairs.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/09/JSON-Web-Token-1.png" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 2 – JSON Web Token authentication and authorization flow.</em></p> 
<h3><strong>Design Considerations for Using Custom Attributes (Claims)</strong></h3> 
<p>Claims let you customize and enrich the authorization and association of an identity within the context of an access token. You can use the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/CognitoIdentityServiceProvider.html">AWS Software Development Kit (SDK) for JavaScript</a> and write the required services to automatically provision a tenant, create a user with specific custom attributes, and integrate custom logic within the application to permit or deny requests based on these corresponding claims. <em>Figure&nbsp;3</em> illustrates how you can architect a SaaS application to incorporate claims for scoping tenant access.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/09/Obtaining-and-Verifying-Tenant-Context.png" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 3 – Obtaining and verifying tenant context.</em></p> 
<p>In a multi-tenant application, a client application generally will pass the obtained ID token to a multi-tenant service. The service is responsible for decoding and parsing the token, and assessing the corresponding claims to verify the user and tenant context, as shown in <em>Figure 4</em>. By tying together multiple claims, you can address varied and often complex requirements for how the user is allowed to access an application or infrastructure.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/09/Authentication-and-Authorization-Workflow.png" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 4 – Steps for authentication and authorization.</em></p> 
<h3><strong>SaaS Examples for Custom Attributes</strong></h3> 
<p>Developers can take various approaches to introducing custom attributes, identifying tenant context, and authorizing users within a SaaS application when using Amazon Cognito. You must understand the business requirements to determine the appropriate choice for your architecture.</p> 
<p>I’ve put together the following references to describe some of these approaches.</p> 
<h4><strong>Example 1 – Introduction of Custom Attributes for Tenant Context</strong></h4> 
<p>One common approach to enforce tenant isolation is to define multiple custom attributes, which, when combined, uniquely identify the entity, its permissions, and its associated tenant. A unique tenant identifier, a role to designate permissions (for a user), and a universally unique alphanumeric string of the identity give the application sufficient context to assess the identity in a multi-tenant environment. This approach may be extended with additional business logic, such as a usage plan that provides hierarchical layers of features or usage.</p> 
<p>A JWT token obtained following an authentication, as shown in <em>Figure 5</em>, might include four custom claims: tenant identifier (<span style="font-family: courier">tenant_id</span>), role (<span style="font-family: courier">role</span>), usage plan (<span style="font-family: courier">tier</span>) to determine the plan the tenant is subscribed to (free, standard, professional), and a universally unique identifier (<span style="font-family: courier">sub</span>) generated by the authorization server to uniquely identity the entity. In this example, you can integrate the required application code to assess the value within custom attributes, associate or generate the permissions required for the user, and provide the appropriate access.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/09/Amazon-Cognito-ID-Token.png" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 5 – Structure of the Amazon Cognito ID token with custom attributes.</em></p> 
<p>Another example of this approach is when a user signs in to an application with their user name and password. The user is aware only of the functionality and data they have access to. They’re unaware that their tenant identifier is <span style="font-family: courier">4c7a2b201a57672bb748f821723d52c4</span>, their role is <span style="font-family: courier">TenantAdmin</span>, their tier is <span style="font-family: courier">Professional</span>, and their sub is <span style="font-family: courier">5b6a5bad-f59b-48ad-8f2d-9785d5a455b2</span>.</p> 
<p>Custom attributes provide a transparent approach to providing identity and isolation, which is handled by the application’s identity platform. If the user submits a request to create a product, the service is responsible for verifying the signature of the JWT token, decoding the token to obtain the corresponding claims, and invoking the expected micro-service methods or functions with the corresponding claims.</p> 
<p>Amazon Cognito user pools, when combined with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html">Amazon Cognito Federated Identities</a>, can match a role with a custom attribute, thereby associating a user who has a specific attribute with the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. You can combine multiple custom attributes into a hash or map, and then assign this value as the criteria for the claim match. This allows for various permutations that can be used to assess the permissions required for the identity.</p> 
<h4><strong>Example 2 – Introduction of User Pool Groups</strong></h4> 
<p>Amazon Cognito user pools give an administrator the capability to add groups and associate users with groups via the console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or programmatically. Doing so introduces specific custom attributes (<span style="font-family: courier">cognito:groups</span> and <span style="font-family: courier">cognito:roles</span>, as described in <em>Figure 6</em>) that are managed and maintained by Amazon Cognito and available within the ID token.<br /> This approach simplifies the administration required for managing the required, mutable, and editable flags provided by the user pool’s custom attributes, by handing off the administration of these attributes to Amazon Cognito. In addition, user pools can associate a role with a group when combined with Amazon Cognito Federated Identities.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/09/Cognito-ID-Token-Group-Attributes.png" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 6 – Structure of the Amazon Cognito ID token with group attributes.</em></p> 
<h4><strong>Example 3 – Combination of User Pool Groups with Custom Attributes</strong></h4> 
<p>In some scenarios, custom attributes might be necessary within an application context, but the manageability of role association to claim match doesn’t meet a developer’s requirements. In this scenario, it might make sense for you to use custom attributes for application context, but leverage the group association for the tenant context, roles, and policies.</p> 
<p>In <em>Figure 7</em>, John Doe is assigned to a group designated <span style="font-family: courier">GroupName</span>, has an association for the <span style="font-family: courier">ReadOnly</span> role, and has the custom attribute of <span style="font-family: courier">customer:tier : Professional Tier</span>. The role may be associated with the group through the Amazon Cognito association to simplify access management, but the custom attribute for the tenant usage plan may be maintained separately and without the need for additional permissions or a specific group.</p> 
<p>Amazon Cognito can support thousands of groups per user pool, and this model provides you with much-needed flexibility.</p> 
<p>By associating tenant-specific users that have shared custom attributes with a user pool group, you can use a hybrid approach to tenant isolation. You can then add custom logic into the application that is responsible for scoping the tenant-level access through the evaluation of the provided custom attributes. This approach to tenant-level security may be further solidified by associating users with tenant-specific groups or corresponding roles. This allows for a re-enforcement of tenant-level isolation for AWS resources by providing fine grained IAM access policies.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/09/Cognito-Token-ID-Custom-Attributes.png" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 7 – Structure of the Amazon Cognito ID token with groups and custom attributes.</em></p> 
<h4><strong>Example 4 – Introduction of User Pool Per Tenant</strong></h4> 
<p>Multiple user pools provide a greater level of isolation between customers. This approach can be combined with the previous examples for additional flexibility. Providing one user pool per tenant is an acceptable approach to multi-tenancy and allows for customization of custom attributes per customer.</p> 
<p>In this scenario, if you have customers with unique requirements, each requirement can be met with minimal risk to the remaining tenants of the system. Note that the application must be developed with the appropriate programmatic and strategic approach to fit these requirements.</p> 
<p>There are some scalability considerations to evaluate in this design pattern, including AWS service limits, manageability of multiple user directories, and maintenance of application security. For more information about this model, see the Tenant Isolation Architectures whitepaper from AWS.</p> 
<h4><strong>Example 5 – Maintaining a Multi-Tenant Identity Platform for SaaS Providers</strong></h4> 
<p>This example targets ISVs who are interested in becoming multi-tenant (OpenID) identity providers, and allows you to consume the identity platform through customer-maintained Amazon Cognito user directories. As shown in <em>Figure 8</em>, an ISV can architect a solution in which tenants are SaaS providers that have tenants themselves.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/09/Identify-Platform-Hierarchal-Structure-1.png" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 8 – Example of a multi-tenant identity platform heirarchal structure.</em></p> 
<p>An ISV can manage and maintain AWS accounts through the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/CognitoIdentityServiceProvider.html">AWS SDK for JavaScript APIs</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html">roles for cross-account access</a>. You maintain control and administrative privileges to the Amazon Cognito user pools within your own account, but can choose to delegate the responsibility and overhead of identity management to the ISV.</p> 
<h3><strong>Considerations: Introducing Custom Attributes</strong></h3> 
<p>While the integration of custom attributes has significant benefits, there are some aspects developers should consider when architecting a multi-tenant system.</p> 
<p>You should carefully consider the impact of introducing mutable or required attributes into an environment. For example, if a third party is able to manipulate the <span style="font-family: courier">tenant_id</span> attribute, this change could disrupt the consistency and security of the system. Therefore, you should decide which custom attributes are required and configure these as non-mutable.</p> 
<p>Integrating permissions within the context of a user pool is important as well. If you introduce a custom attribute labeled <span style="font-family: courier">role</span> to maintain the permissions of a user within a tenant, you must define the attribute as mutable. This will be required to constrain the mutability of the attribute to approved users. SaaS architects commonly define a tenant administrator as the appropriate <span style="font-family: courier">role</span> and responsible <span style="font-family: courier">party</span> for maintaining tenant specific users and data.</p> 
<p>We recommend that you complete a competitive review of potential identity solutions before your development cycle. During this review, it’s important to ensure that solutions allow for the introduction and mutability of custom attributes and claims. This allows for long-term extensibility of the SaaS identity architecture.</p> 
<h3><strong>Next Steps: Identity with a Multi-Tenant Mindset</strong></h3> 
<p>To streamline the move to a secure and agile multi-tenant system, we recommend that developers minimize the complexity required to identify and manage tenant context. Amazon Cognito enables you to simplify, secure, and scale your architecture with custom attributes. Offloading the management of tenant context and user roles to custom attributes allows a business to focus on its product and go-to-market strategy.</p> 
<p>If you’re interested in understanding the design considerations for integrating custom attributes within a SaaS application, you can evaluate a SaaS reference architecture in real-time by deploying the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/saas/identity-with-cognito/">SaaS Identity and Isolation with Amazon Cognito Quick Start</a> within your AWS account.</p> 
<p>The Quick Start equips you with a full working solution that digs into the nuances of injecting tenant identity into SaaS applications. It addresses a broad range of identity topics and illustrates how tenant context is introduced via Amazon Cognito and used in combination with IAM to scope access to tenant resources.</p>

<p><strong><em>By Brett Moss, SVP and General Manager of Hyperscale Cloud at Ensono</em></strong></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/14/MSP-Badge-300x150.png" />Looking back, October 2008 is as good a time as any to designate as the beginning of the first generation of mass adoption of the cloud.</p> 
<p>It was during that time that Amazon Web Services (AWS) removed the beta label from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and officially provided a world of software developers with virtually unlimited storage and compute capacity, available on-demand and at low-cost. Those developers were off to the races—building more and more applications in the cloud, and taking advantage of the many features and services AWS began to add.</p> 
<p>That first generation overcame the challenge of thinking of infrastructure as code. They learned to stop thinking of compute instances as precious snowflakes that required extensive recovery plans, and they started thinking of them as disposable resources that could—and should—be shut down at the first sign of trouble, and then automatically rebuilt.</p> 
<p>The first generation of cloud adopters merged the practices of infrastructure automation and code deployment automation, so that the infrastructure running their apps was actually deployed by the frequent pushes coming from a code repository. They faced many challenges reckoning with the awesome power of AWS and pioneered cloud engineering in the process.</p> 
<p>If we want to point to the zenith of the first generation of cloud adoption, we could do worse than July 2011, when Netflix announced it had developed a set of tools (the Simian Army) that randomly terminated production compute instances during working hours in order to make sure engineers designed their use of AWS for fault tolerance and rapid, automated recovery. There’s nothing like taking off the training wheels to get the most out of auto scaling groups.</p> 
<h3><strong>The Next Generation</strong></h3> 
<p>The first generation of cloud adopters had a massive advantage over the mid-market and enterprise customers who came after them—their applications were born in the cloud. They did not have years, even decades, of legacy infrastructure running these new apps, so they were largely unencumbered to go “all-in” on AWS.</p> 
<p>Today, a new generation of companies is navigating a journey to AWS, and those companies have a very different set of challenges to overcome.</p> 
<p>Mid-market and enterprise customers embraced AWS as a viable execution venue for their workloads sometime around 2015, when Capital One and GE stood on the keynote stage at re:Invent and declared themselves all-in on AWS. Of course, there had been shadow IT and all sorts of testing and tinkering happening prior to then, but the data indicates later adopters only accelerated their movement to the cloud in the past three years or so.</p> 
<p> 
<!--Continue reading--></p> 
<p>This next generation of adoption brings a new generation of challenges. At <a href="https://www.ensono.com/">Ensono</a>, our stock-in-trade is this set of challenges. We are a company built to work with mid-market and enterprise clients that were not born in the cloud and run production applications on myriad computing systems. Our clients simultaneously run bare metal servers, virtualized servers, company data centers, hosted systems, mainframes, and AWS. Our job, working with clients, is to make it all work together to achieve whatever outcomes they define as critical to their businesses.</p> 
<p>With extensive installed IT—called “technical debt” on a bad day and “legacy” on a good day—our clients cannot simply throw everything away and uproot to AWS overnight. They hold equipment and data centers as assets on their balance sheets; many of their applications are not ready to support the advanced capabilities of AWS; and their entire business depends on SAP estates that took 20 years to get fully tuned. Most do not yet have the in-house skills to stand up to the Simian Army randomly switching off their infrastructure.</p> 
<p>Let’s look at two examples we frequently encounter working with the new generation of AWS users.</p> 
<h3><strong>Enterprise Applications in the Cloud</strong></h3> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/14/MSP-Lifecycle-Square-300x300.png" />The first challenge we encounter concerns how to use AWS for enterprise applications. For our clients, these apps are the central nervous systems of their companies. The idea of making changes to SAP and Microsoft installations sends chills down the spines, but AWS provides a compelling option for these applications. We work with clients every day to migrate and operate in the cloud, minimizing disruption to their businesses.</p> 
<p>SAP customers are looking at how to make the transition to HANA after SAP stopped supporting other databases for its newest generation of business applications. Having spent many years honing the people, processes, and technology to make SAP deployments work the way they want, our clients are staring down the barrel of a wholesale database migration, and they have to do it without taking down the operations of their company. These clients are looking for any way to de-risk the process, and Ensono developed a dedicated practice around using AWS technology to assist clients in this transition.</p> 
<p>Our approach focuses on three outcomes: fast migration, reduced capital expenditures, and reduced operating expenses. To reduce the overall migration time, Ensono works with AWS in a Rapid Migration Methodology, a set of tools and best practices created by SAP and AWS that enables Ensono to help customers rapidly test migrations. Using this methodology, Ensono extracts and refactors database data to HANA format and deploys it into a test environment on AWS. In most cases, this can be done in a matter of days.</p> 
<p>Once the testing is validated, Ensono’s SAP architects work with our peers at AWS and with the client to deploy an architecture on one of 12 SAP-certified HANA AWS instance types, including the powerful x1e, one of the largest instance types available today. These instances are some of the most unique in the industry for their ability to support the extensive in-memory requirements of the HANA database, and they help save our clients the requirement to procure new and expensive hardware.</p> 
<p>Finally, once the SAP estate is in steady-state on AWS, we use our own cloud automation tooling to create ongoing economic efficiencies in the environment. For example, this might mean automatically turning on and off lower-level environments outside of business hours in order to reduce the infrastructure costs without compromising the availability of the SAP applications.</p> 
<p>With Microsoft migrations, we work with clients to use AWS technology to achieve a leaner, lower-cost operation. Taking MS SQL as an example, AWS’s unique approach to providing low-latency connectivity between Availability Zones (AZs) enables Ensono engineers to reduce the required number of compute nodes for a SQL deployment by a factor of up to one-third. Testing has demonstrated a very consistent latency of under 2ms between AZs in any AWS region.</p> 
<p>This means we can deploy an HA cluster with fewer nodes because we can use a two-node multi-AZ solution and forego the typical third node that would be required for DR. For .net shops, or clients running large SQL-specific apps like Dynamics, Biztalk, ERP, or those building data lakes on SQL, this ongoing cost reduction is considerable and does not come at the cost of compromised availability.</p> 
<h3><strong>Installed IT</strong></h3> 
<p>The final challenge we will discuss in this article is one that comes from clients with extensive and varied infrastructure systems in use. While the next generation of cloud adopters understand the many advantages of operating on AWS, they also understand that applications in their current forms may be most suited to a hybrid architecture.</p> 
<p>At Ensono, we think about this along two axes: the venue, and the application.</p> 
<p>To diagnose the most suitable venue for various tiers of an application, we use the paradigm of systems of record and systems of engagement. Because of Ensono’s strong pedigree managing mainframe and midrange infrastructure for large clients, we often work with companies running applications built for this kind of system.</p> 
<p>Looking carefully at those applications, Ensono engineers make recommendations involving parsing out the tiers of an app in order to achieve the financial, agility, or operational goals of the client. It may be that a system of record can stay on a mainframe until the mainframe keels over (which, we all know, will probably have a long life cycle.) But, the system of engagement—say, a mobile front end—is a prime candidate for the cloud.</p> 
<p>With architectural decisions in place, the client experience will largely depend on Ensono’s ability to communicate back to them in the language the matters most—that of the application itself. Regardless of the multiple types of infrastructure powering a workload, our job is to maintain the availability, security, and efficiencies of the app. In Ensono’s case, we achieve this using our own systems, collectively called Ensono M.O., that allow us to manage hybrid architectures through a single set of processes, automation, and reporting. For clients using AWS, M.O. connects directly into AWS and tools from APN Technology Partners that provide our clients the application-level view they require.</p> 
<h3><strong>Next Steps</strong></h3> 
<p>As AWS continues to disrupt the enormous base of installed infrastructure around the world, the next generation of adopters will use AWS tools, technology, and APN Partners to address their new challenges. They are not the same challenges faced by the first wave of born-in-the-cloud AWS users, but they are surmountable, and are being continually addressed so that companies can reap the benefits of the cloud.</p>

<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/14/AWS-Marketplace_border-300x150.png" />AWS Marketplace, which has over 4,000 software listings from more than 1,250 popular software vendors across 35 product categories, announced that customers can now receive specific pricing and end-user license terms with Seller Private Offers.</p> 
<p>With this feature, software sellers participating in the Enhanced Data Sharing (EDS) program can extend to any AWS account a version of their product, enabling volume discounts through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace">AWS Marketplace</a>. This means AWS customers can enjoy all the same benefits of consolidated billing, cost analysis, and subscription management of AWS Marketplace while paying a lower privately negotiated price visible only to that customer and the seller.</p> 
<p>The following information will help you start supporting customer specific pricing and end-user license terms with Seller Private Offers:</p> 
<h3><strong>Do you sell Amazon Machine Image (AMI) or SaaS products on AWS Marketplace?</strong></h3> 
<p>If so, you can now offer customers specific offers through AWS Marketplace. As customers make larger commitments, they often request special pricing or end-user license terms. AWS now makes it possible for customers to receive private offers with pre-negotiated pricing and end-user license terms directly through AWS Marketplace. This new feature&nbsp;is available to any AWS Marketplace software seller participating in the EDS program that compensates their sales team for AWS Marketplace sales.</p> 
<h3><strong>What&nbsp;about APN Partners who want to increase sales through AWS Marketplace?</strong></h3> 
<p>As a seller, you will be able to use AWS Marketplace to reach more customers. With Seller Private Offers, you can offer custom pricing and end-user license terms on your customers’ existing AWS bill. You’ll be attracting customers who have chosen AWS Marketplace due to the ease of finding, purchasing, and deploying solutions. Customers can quickly review your end-user license agreement, subscribe through AWS Marketplace, and receive a single bill for all their software purchases through AWS Marketplace.</p> 
<h3><strong>What does the release of Seller Private Offers mean for customers?</strong></h3> 
<p>Customers get a simple way to receive specific pricing and end-user license terms through AWS Marketplace. This makes it easier to consolidate more of their purchase on their AWS bill and take advantage of consolidated billing, cost analytics, and renewal management. Customers can lower their software costs while buying through AWS Marketplace. They can also receive a specific end-user licensing agreement to cover any required custom terms.</p> 
<h3><strong>What is the EDS program and how do I enroll?</strong></h3> 
<p>The AWS Marketplace Enhanced Data Sharing (EDS) program focuses on delivering “enhanced” buyer information, such as buyer email domain, AWS Account ID, and location, on a daily and monthly basis to select AWS Marketplace Sellers. The goal of delivering buyer information is to provide a framework for sellers to compensate their sales teams for AWS Marketplace subscription revenue.</p> 
<p>Sharing monthly billed revenue information, usage information, and disbursed funds information by buyer provides a mechanism to help you correctly map deals and opportunities to the appropriate sales representative by company, geography, and AWS Account ID. This program requires that the data only be used to activate and motivate AWS Marketplace Seller field sales via formal sales compensation plans.</p> 
<p>For more information regarding the program and how to enroll, contact <a href="mailto:aws-marketplace-seller-ops@amazon.com">aws-marketplace-seller-ops@amazon.com</a>.</p> 
<h3><strong>How do I get started with Seller Private Offers?</strong></h3> 
<p>We’ve made it easy for you to deliver private offers to your customers. To extend a private offer on one of your existing AWS Marketplace products, you only need to provide your customer’s account numbers (their payer account and any sub-accounts), the product code you’d like to discount, and the new product price. You can also share an offer duration (how long the price is good for) and a new EULA as a PDF. The AWS Marketplace Customer Business Desk will share the private offer’s URL with you and your customers. The URL is only visible after signing in with the provided account, meaning only your customer can see the price and EULA meant for them. They can then subscribe at any time prior to the offer’s expiration.</p> 
<h3><strong>How do I learn more?</strong></h3> 
<p>To learn more about using Seller Private Offers on AWS Marketplace, reach out to your AWS Marketplace Category Manager or the AWS Marketplace Managed Catalog Operations team.</p>

<p><strong><em>By Thomas Robinson, Solutions Architect at AWS</em></strong></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/10/Security-Icon-300x150.png" />AWS Partner Network (APN) Partners new to managed services often have questions about how to protect their customers from social engineering attacks and how to best test themselves to meet APN Program requirements. In this post, we’ll provide guidance for APN Partners&nbsp;and inform customers on what to expect from their Managed Service Provider (MSP).</p> 
<p>A large part of an AWS Solutions Architect’s role is helping customers maintain a robust security posture that follows best practices. An entire pillar of our <a href="https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS_Well-Architected_Framework.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Well-Architected Framework</a>, which we use to help validate our customer’s critical workloads, is dedicated to security. We work with next-gen <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/msp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS MSP Partners</a> and ensure they maintain secure environments.</p> 
<p>To join the AWS MSP Program, an APN Partner undergoes a third-party validation audit to demonstrate they are following AWS best practices for securing cloud environments. While part of meeting these controls is technical, the support aspect of a managed services engagement includes a very human element. Items such as 24/7 call centers, helpdesk and escalation e-mails, or chat systems are all an attack surface which a malicious party can use to disrupt a business, or gain additional information useful in another type of attack.</p> 
<p>To validate that our AWS MSP Partners are protecting these vulnerable areas, they must identify their attack surface, and then test potential attacks, as seen in the AWS MSP Validation Checklist under Control 8.1.9:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>“Partner performs secret shopper testing on vectors vulnerable for social engineering attacks, including call, chat and email systems. User validation should not utilize confidential data like social security numbers, or personal security questions.”</em></p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>In the same way a traditional&nbsp;MSP is responsible for the physical security of your datacenter, a next-gen&nbsp;MSP is an AWS customer’s trusted resource for helping maintain their portion of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shared Responsibility Model</a>. Instead of physical keys, the MSP is their customer’s gatekeepers into the cloud, providing secure access methods and enforcement of change processes.</p> 
<h3><strong>Best Practices and Anti-Patterns for Identifying and Minimizing Attacks</strong></h3> 
<p>Before building a process for testing, APN Partners should identify exactly what vulnerabilities may exist, and follow best practices to reduce or eliminate the impact of a support channel being an attack vector.</p> 
<h4><strong>Federated Access for the AWS Console</strong></h4> 
<p>Managing access to the AWS Console via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Identity and Access Management</a> (IAM) covers the entire lifecycle, including creating, providing credentials for, and disabling users. Alternatively, by using a SAML provider for access to the AWS Console, an MSP can allow their customers or MSP Support Staff to use their own <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-saml.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAML-based federation IdP for accessing the AWS Console</a>. This eliminates the need for the MSP to create a support process for resetting passwords and MFA devices, and allow the customer to directly manage their own users through existing processes.</p> 
<h4><strong>Temporary Credentials for Users</strong></h4> 
<p>To use services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon S3</a>) or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, developers and engineers need access keys with the minimum permissions necessary in accounts managed by the MSP. AWS provides options to manually create and destroy access keys for IAM users. Although access keys are still used, we recommend users take advantage of temporary credentials provided by the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS), which has the capability of automatically rotating credentials.</p> 
<p>Like console access, developers and engineers can be provided temporary credentials via <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html#CreatingSAML-configuring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAML-based federation for API access</a>. This is a common AWS best practice, as automated key rotation reduces the chance your credentials will be exposed and vulnerable in the wild. For MSPs, this eliminates the need for a process to issue and rotate keys for end customers.</p> 
<h4><strong>Temporary Credentials for Applications</strong></h4> 
<p>Applications running&nbsp;on AWS also need AWS credentials to use our services. These credentials should be short lived, automatically rotated as they expire, and adhere to the principals of least privilege. By providing <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IAM Roles applied to an Instance Profile</a>, developers can create applications on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) using the AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK) without the need to securely store and rotate Access Keys in a configuration file.</p> 
<h4><strong>Consider Non-AWS Resources</strong></h4> 
<p>Apart from access to AWS APIs, MSPs should minimize the need for manual interaction with other customer access tasks such as maintaining authentication for SSH or RDP. By using the Amazon EC2 Run Command you can gate routine access to servers by authenticating users via IAM to execute commands instead of accessing them directly with SSH keys or passwords. For secrets management, the MSP should consider the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/systems-manager/parameter-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parameter Store</a> feature to provide a self-service place for customers to keep their configuration data such as database strings and passwords, which is also gated by IAM authorization.</p> 
<h4><strong>Security-as-Code</strong></h4> 
<p>As companies move towards more frequent self-service deployments, the change control process for approving changes shifts away from a manual review towards a pre-approved, well-defined, and frequently reviewed configuration. For example, PCI DSS Requirement 1 includes controls such as environments containing cardholder data should not be allowed access to the public internet or untrusted networks, allowing only necessary traffic. These rules should be included as part of your deployment processes to automatically validate that releases meet defined standards. Maintaining a high security environment and deploying frequently are not mutually exclusive.</p> 
<h3><strong>Testing Considerations</strong></h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h4><strong>Detecting and Preventing Unauthorized Changes</strong></h4> 
<p>It is important to identify what changes a user may request from support channels and test the authorization for those changes, as well as ensuring controls around high-impact changes are enforced. Using our previous example of security-as-code, a single requestor should not have authorization to change the definition of acceptable traffic. Testing that appropriate change control review is followed and a requestor cannot bypass this by making an “urgent” support call maintains the integrity of your compliance controls.</p> 
<h4><strong>Preventing Data Leakage</strong></h4> 
<p>Even with a support structure where minimal change could be requested over channels such as phone or email, interaction via these methods can be used to extract information about a customer or their environment. Extracting information such as service endpoints, application platforms, or architecture details can help an attacker craft a more intelligent technical attack on customer applications. Always ensure sensitive information is communicated over appropriate channels, such as a support portal secured by multi-factor authentication.</p> 
<h4><strong>Protecting Against Email and Spear Phishing</strong></h4> 
<p>Helpdesk emails, specific engineering contact, and known escalation paths are some of the various ways attackers will try and compromise security. Using these paths, an attacker can attempt to enact unauthorized changes, gain additional information, or perform a technical attack by installing malware on an engineer’s device. These support channels should have a technical validation of the requestor, such as directing requests through a password and MFA protected portal, and avoid using personal details such as social security numbers or a challenge question.</p> 
<h4><strong>Testing Insider Threats</strong></h4> 
<p>Testing should be tuned to mitigate against insider threats, whether an existing employee exceeding their authority or a disgruntled former employee attempting to regain access. Tests should be crafted to assume an attacker may have a level of insight to processes such as escalation email paths or phone numbers. As such, it’s important to ensure you have safeguards around these paths and are testing them regularly.</p> 
<h3><strong>Building a Testing Process</strong></h3> 
<p>Once attack vectors have been identified and minimized, a robust process for testing can be built. This pairs technology solutions to perform phishing style attacks with human driven testing. Some APN Partners train resources to perform tests internally and dedicate time producing actionable output from those exercises. Other APN Partners engage with consulting firms focused on security to help them build a testing plan as well as provide resources for carrying out those tests. For APN Partners focused on customers in verticals with strict compliance or security requirements, such as financial services or healthcare, this investment in a third-party validation can provide a stronger position when customers are reviewing potential managed services providers.</p>

<p><em>By Ian Scofield, Juan Villa, and Mike Ruiz, Partner Solutions Architects at AWS</em></p> 
<p>This is the second post in our series documenting a project to fix issues with the GameDay architecture by using tenets of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Well-Architected Framework</a>. See <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/testing-aws-gameday-with-the-aws-well-architected-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part 1 of the series</a>&nbsp;for an overview of the process, a description of the initial review, and a list of the critical findings identified by the review team.</p> 
<p>In this post, we’ll cover the steps we took to fix the critical findings identified by the review team. In future posts, we will share our plans to refine our architecture through continuous improvement and collaboration with AWS solutions architects.</p> 
<b>Findings</b> 
<p>As noted in Part 1 of the serires, the review team delivered a list of critical findings we needed to prioritize and fix immediately, as well as a list of non-critical ideas that we should consider addressing in our roadmap for the GameDay architecture.</p> 
<p>Here were the critical items:</p> 
<li>The legacy administrative scripts for GameDay use AWS access keys and secret access keys that are stored in plain text in an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon DynamoDB</a> table.</li> 
<li>The load generator is a single instance in a single <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Availability Zone</a>&nbsp;(AZ) without any recovery options configured.</li> 
<li>The disaster recovery (DR) plan is not clearly defined, and the recovery point objectives (RPO) and recovery time objectives (RTO) are not set. Also, the disaster recovery plan isn’t periodically tested against the RPO and RTO objectives.</li> 
<p>The review team noted they would welcome a chance to review plans for remediation before implementation, so we set to work analyzing the deficiencies, documenting our plans, and making a rough estimate of the level of effort required to implement the fixes before making any changes.</p> 
<p>Here is the high-level remediation plan we came up with to address the critical findings, in order of priority:</p> 
<li><strong>Implement the use of cross-account roles to eliminate the usage of access and secret keys.&nbsp;</strong><br /> A quick review of the code suggested that we should allocate one day to develop and test cross-account access, and another day to update the instructions and train staff on the new feature. Since this fix seemed relatively simple and provided both security and operational benefits, we decided to set it as the highest priority to be integrated into the new design.</li> 
<p></p> 
<li><strong>For the load generator, move from a single instance to a container model that would allow for a clustered deployment.&nbsp;</strong><br /> This change was a little more complicated than the previous access key fix. We needed to modify our application to store state in DynamoDB instead of writing locally, and we needed to package our various applications and binaries into Docker containers. We planned to create an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EC2 Container Service</a> (Amazon ECS) task definition and service for each of these components, which would take care of the scheduling and task placement for us. Switching to DynamoDB and containers would enable us to move our hard-coded configuration to an Auto Scaling group launch configuration, remove all hard-coded values in favor of variables set at launch, and use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS CloudFormation</a> templates for the deployment mechanism.<p></p> <p>These changes would net considerable improvements and have little impact on the overall flow of the game, although we did have to update the load management tool and game setup scripts to use DynamoDB and the Auto Scaling group rather than a static configuration file.We allocated two weeks to develop and test these new features, and one week to update our documentation and train staff on the new operation.</p></li> 
<li><strong>Create a disaster recovery plan and validate it.<br /> </strong>Automating our infrastructure deployment with Amazon ECS and Auto Scaling groups simplified our disaster recovery plan, but it wasn’t a complete solution. There were still gaps in our recovery process and furthermore, having a solution but not testing it, or, at a minimum, walking through various scenarios, would leave us vulnerable to process gaps when the time came to put the plan into action. We allocated an additional week to create the plan, and an additional day to verify that all contingencies were covered and rehearsed.</li> 
<p>We shared our plans with the review team before starting this work, to ensure that we were on the right track to meet all the requirements. The review team gave us the thumbs up, and we began putting our plan into action.</p> 
<b>Initial analysis and rearchitecture</b> 
<p>Although the list seemed straightforward, we quickly realized that these items pointed to a common underlying problem: our architecture was very simplistic, dated, and did not make good use of the modern features provided by the AWS platform. When we initially built GameDay, we focused on functionality and built an environment based on previous experience. However, the architecture didn’t really embrace modern tools or techniques, like the notion of building for failure, and anticipating the need for better disaster recovery capabilities.</p> 
<p>With this in mind, we realized that we should attack this core architectural issue, which would, in turn, solve a majority of the critical findings as well as a large number of the non-critical recommendations. To achieve this, we moved from a single instance load generator to Docker containers running in an Amazon ECS cluster (see diagram below). This immediately gave us the benefit of a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-AZ</a> architecture and the ability to scale our infrastructure and handle the loss of components. We also modified additional services from the load generator to be run as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Lambda</a> functions, which handle scaling and infrastructure management automatically.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/10/19/WA1.png" /></p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Updated Amazon ECS architecture</em></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>While pursuing this new architecture, we realized that our previous deployment process involved manual creation of resources and configuration. We took a hard stance from the start to treat our infrastructure as code and used AWS CloudFormation to define our environment. This allowed us to easily version our infrastructure as we progressed through the remediation phase, and also played a critical role in developing our new disaster recovery plan.</p> 
<b>Remediation</b> 
<h3>Issue 1: AWS access keys</h3> 
<p>Surprisingly, this item turned out to be the easiest to address. AWS provides a feature to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enable role-based access between accounts</a>. Since we had already automated the configuration of both the admin and player accounts with AWS CloudFormation, it seemed simple to update the template to create a role rather than an access/secret key pair in the player account.</p> 
<p>We initially thought it would be a massive undertaking to modify our entire code base to use sts:AssumeRole, but this turned out to be trivial. Because we used the AWS SDKs, and both access keys and IAM roles are part of the default credential provider chain and fully supported by the SDK, the only change we had to make was to remove the access keys and pass in the role ARN to assume.</p> 
<h3>Issue 2: Load generator</h3> 
<p>We solved this issue by moving from a single EC2 instance to an Amazon ECS cluster. To do this, we had to modify the application to externally store team and player data. Since we were already using Amazon DynamoDB for other metadata, we chose it for this purpose as well. Moving the state to DynamoDB and polling for configuration was essential, as the load generator containers were now ephemeral, and we didn’t want to create a new service to track members, but just to push updates.</p> 
<p>Amazon ECS enabled us to operate our load generator as a service within Amazon ECS, so we could scale the application throughout the game without having to manage a complex, distributed, configuration management tool. It also provided us with additional fault tolerance by scheduling and placing tasks across three Availability Zones, and replacing containers in the event of any errors or failures.</p> 
<h3>Issue 3: Disaster recovery</h3> 
<p>Disaster recovery was by far the most difficult remediation we attempted. The issues were not solely technical in that we had developed plans to expand the use of tools and techniques to rapidly and reliably deploy the application. However, the harder to solve challenges we encountered were things like definitions (How do we define disaster?), expectations (What is a reasonable recovery time objective?), compliance (How often do we test DR? What can we automate? Is our testing framework robust enough to tell us that our DR plan is still valid after a new release?), and ownership (Who is responsible for declaring a disaster? Who is responsible for ensuring that the process is adequately maintained over time?).</p> 
<p>Ultimately, we decided on a phased, incremental approach rather than tackling all of these issues at once. We allocated one day to strategize a response to a simulated disaster that focused on a simulated event—loss of control of a production account—and another day to write up our findings.</p> 
<p>The simulated test involved members of the team sitting in a room with a moderator responsible for presenting a scenario, and then simulating the recovery process with whatever materials we had at hand. The moderator would keep us honest, challenge responses, and add details as the scenario progressed. The recovery team would keep careful notes, identify gaps, lucky breaks, and areas for improvement, and ultimately document our effective RTO and RPO.</p> 
<p>Given the scenario—total loss of control of our production account—we quickly decided that the only safe response available to us was to abandon ship and simulate recovery in an entirely new account. We happened to have an unused, largely unconfigured account we could use for this purpose, but it was clear that account creation and initial setup would need to be accounted for in our RTO. The deployment of the game assets in the new account was significantly eased by the use of the new CloudFormation templates, which, luckily, were stored in an S3 bucket owned by another AWS account that was unaffected by the breach.</p> 
<p>Much more problematic was the recovery of the game data stored in DynamoDB. Our current backup plan was manually operated and pushed backups to an S3 bucket in the same account and AWS Region as the source data. Obviously, an attacker that had control of our primary account would also have control of our only backups. Since the backups weren’t automated and were inaccessible in the event we lost control of our account, our RPO could never be clearly defined. Simply put, we could not assure a successful recovery in this scenario.</p> 
<p>Despite these challenges, we deemed the DR simulation to be very successful. We were able to test recovery, identify what was working (decoupling data, automating deployment with AWS CloudFormation), what needed work (automated DynamoDB backups and audit logging to an S3 bucket in a different account), and what our current, achievable RTOs and RPOs were.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, we added the recovery and audit work to our immediate roadmap, and agreed on a future cadence of quarterly DR simulations to continue to investigate our real response capability as changes were made and new disasters were contemplated.</p> 
<b>Conclusion</b> 
<p>We started this process with an architecture that, now looking back, was very fragile and left us vulnerable both from a security and a disaster recovery standpoint. It was uncomfortable to have our shortcomings identified, but by having knowledgeable AWS solutions architects walk through our architecture and point out areas for improvement, we were able to document and prioritize changes. This allowed us to take a step back and examine where we needed to focus our efforts in order to provide a better experience for our customers by mitigating potential problems down the road. We now are much more confident in our architecture and know that we are better prepared for failure.</p> 
<p>However, our GameDay application is far from perfect, as we found out in our disaster recovery simulation. Additionally, we still have recommendations on our roadmap from the initial review. As AWS comes out with new features, and best practices are updated, we’ll continue to work with other solutions architects to ensure that we are incorporating these features and practices into our architecture.</p> 
<p>In the next post, we’ll take a look at what happened six months after we implemented the changes discussed in this post, considering that AWS released new features during that time. We’ll walk through our evaluation process of these new features to see where they can be incorporated. Additionally, we’ll discuss how we continued to work with our review team on the non-critical items.</p>

<p><em>This month, Partner Solutions Architects Tim Mattison, Roy Rodan, and Claudine Morales highlight offerings from AWS Technology Partners Cesanta, GorillaStack, and GuardiCore.</em></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Cesanta, by Tim Mattison</h3> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/10/13/cesanta.png">they released their own hardware kit based on Espressif’s ESP32 platform</a>, which provides a known-good component for customers to design, develop, and deploy IoT solutions.</p> 
<p>The ESP32 is the successor to the ESP8266 IoT board, and it comes with several enhancements: &nbsp;520K of RAM, a dual-core 240 MHz processor, new security features, 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth support.</p> 
<p>The faster processor means customers are able to efficiently do more time-sensitive compute operations at the edge. The ESP32 is powerful enough to perform digital signal processing (DSP) operations on input signals, and even decode QR codes in real time from its camera interface.</p> 
<p>Additional storage allows customers to add more features to their edge devices. This space can also be used to buffer data while the device is offline, store logs for debugging, or store a backup firmware image to allow for more robust over-the-air firmware deployments.</p> 
<p>Bluetooth v4.2 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) let the ESP32 interact with Bluetooth devices and sensors. With Mongoose OS, the ESP32 can even act as a <a href="https://mongoose-os.com/ble-wifi-gateway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BLE gateway to AWS IoT</a>.</p> 
<p>On the security side, the ESP32 supports secure boot, flash encryption, and cryptographic hardware acceleration. Secure boot prevents tampering with the flash contents. Flash encryption protects the flash contents from being read in plaintext. Cryptographic hardware acceleration allows devices to connect to the cloud faster. These features allow customers to build secure IoT devices.</p> 
<p>If you’re looking to build a new IoT solution, I’d invite you to take a look at the ESP32.&nbsp; For more information, please head on over to Cesanta’s <a href="https://cesanta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> to learn more about their new hardware kit and Mongoose OS.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>GorillaStack, by Roy Rodan</h3> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/10/13/GorillaStack.png">Amazon CloudWatch</a> to help with these tasks. GorillaStack is an AWS Partner that enables DevOps and IT teams to keep track of events in their AWS environments by using simple rules, so they are always up-to-date on the usage and cost of their resources.</p> 
<p>Configuring rules in GorillaStack involves three simple steps:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Identifying the accounts to manage using cross-account AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles</li> 
<li>Defining triggers based on time, cost, server, or volume status</li> 
<li>Specifying the action to be taken</li> 
</ol> 
<p>GorillaStack enables customers to apply these rules to resources across all AWS accounts and Regions. For example, the following image shows a rule set up to delete all detached <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Elastic Block Store</a> (Amazon EBS) volumes in a particular AWS Region:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/10/13/GorillaStack2.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Another helpful GorillaStack feature is its Slack and HipChat integration. This integration makes it even easier to digest events and alerts from CloudTrail and CloudWatch. Instead of having to crawl through CloudTrail or CloudWatch logs for one specific event, you can configure a chatbot to send real-time alerts to a channel or to a specific group of Slack or HipChat users based on any CloudTrail or CloudWatch event. The alert can be expanded to reveal the raw log content, so your DevOps team can take the right actions, as seen here:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/10/13/GorillaStack3.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This Slack and HipChat integration also enables you to receive alerts on scheduled actions before the events take place, so you can delay or cancel these actions. For instance, let’s say you schedule an action to stop development instances from running during the night in order to reduce costs. An alert is sent to a Slack channel to inform you of the upcoming action, and you can then decide if the shutdown process should proceed, snooze, or cancel.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/10/13/GorillaStack4.png" /></p>

<h3>GuardiCore, by Claudine Morales</h3> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/10/13/GuardiCore.png">AWS Shared Responsibility Model</a>, customers are responsible for their security configuration in the AWS cloud. This responsibility involves determining ways to protect and monitor network traffic, which can include obtaining internal workload visibility, effective east-west traffic policy management, and active breach detection and response. GuardiCore, an AWS Technology Partner, offers the Centra Security Platform to help bridge these gaps.</p> 
<p>Once Centra agents are installed on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, the Centra Security Platform performs an application discovery process and collects network traffic data, including layer 7 communication activities among applications running on these instances. The Centra user interface displays a map of all network processes, applications, and traffic flows, giving you the ability to easily visualize everything that is occurring in your network at any given time. &nbsp;This same approach can be applied to your on-premises infrastructure, to give you a centralized view of your entire data center, regardless of location.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/10/13/GuardiCore2.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Centra Security Platform provides micro-segmentation capabilities to give you more granular control over access policies. For instance, it can restrict access to a certain service not only by IP address and port number but also by process name.</p> 
<p>Centra also helps safeguard environments from potential breaches by using multiple intrusion detection and prevention methods. One of these methods involves reputation analysis, where domain names, IP addresses, and file hashes that have been associated with malicious behavior are detected and eliminated instantaneously. Another method involves real-time dynamic deception, in which an attacker, when detected, is redirected to a GuardiCore-hosted deception environment where they continue to execute their attack, thinking that they have successfully penetrated the customer’s infrastructure.</p> 
<p>Inside the deception environment, the attacker’s actions are logged, recorded, and even screenshotted, to enable analysis and insight on their motives and techniques. This allows customers to implement changes to prevent further intrusions from the attacker. &nbsp;The information on the attacker’s actions is also added to the GuardiCore Reputation Service database to enable detection of similar breach attempts in the future.</p>
