<p>This version reflects our most recent program criteria, with improvements focused on raising the bar for both our MSP Partner and Amazon Web Services (AWS) customer experiences. It also reflects feedback from the MSP Partner community and our audit team.</p> 
<p><a href="http://partnercentral.awspartner.com/sfc/#version?selectedDocumentId=0690L000003ivJ9"><strong>Download the AWS MSP Partner Program Validation Checklist v3.2 &gt;&gt;</strong></a></p> 
<b>What is the AWS MSP Partner Program?</b> 
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/managed-service/">AWS MSP Partner Program</a> was developed out of AWS customers’ requests to help them identify APN Partners who could help them migrate, run, and optimize their AWS workloads. The program was thus created to align customers with a set of validated next-generation APN Partners who could deliver this full experience: plan/design &gt;&gt; build/migrate &gt;&gt; run &gt;&gt; optimize.</p> 
<p>In addition to a robust set of requirements, the MSP Partner Program also incorporates the use of a third-party validation audit that brings value to both the participating APN Partners&nbsp;and to AWS customers who can confidently identify qualified MSP Partners.</p> 
<b>What’s New or Different in Version 3.2?</b> 
<p>The focus of the changes from v3.1 to v3.2 has been clarifying, simplifying, and improving the MSP Partner experience. A streamlined Renewal Audit process was introduced in v3.1, and v3.2 further incorporates a Renewal Audit Waiver option for eligible MSP Partners.</p> 
<h3>The full list of changes are:</h3> 
<li>Updated Annual Renewal Audit process and details (see Audit Process &amp; Timing)</li> 
<li>Added Renewal Audit Waiver Option (see Audit Process &amp; Timing)</li> 
<li>Added Impact of Merger, Acquisition &amp; Divestiture Activity (see Audit Process &amp; Timing)</li> 
<li>Added definitions for Reference and Case Study (see Definitions)</li> 
<li>Updated and clarified acceptable evidence for 1.6, 2.2, 4.5, 7.x, 8.1.10, 8.1.11, and 10.x</li> 
<li>Added AWS Services to 3.1—Amazon Aurora, AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS), Amazon GuardDuty, AWS CloudHSM, AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), and AWS Systems Manager</li> 
<li>Updated references to Detailed Billing Report to now reflect Cost &amp; Usage Report</li> 
<li>Updated references and link to APN Portal that now points to APN Partner Central</li> 
<li>Updated evidence requirements for 9.6.1, 9.6.2, and 9.6.3 to specify case studies, in place of use cases (see Definitions)</li> 
<li>Removed section 12.0 Service Reporting and consolidated these items into a single requirement—9.14 Customer Reports</li> 
<li>Removed DevOps requirements from section 9 and moved to section 10.0 DevOps</li> 
<li>Moved section 14.0 SLA Optimization to 11.3</li> 
<li>Provided automatic credit for sections 7.0 Infrastructure&nbsp;&amp; Application Migration Capabilities and 10.0 DevOps for Partners who hold the relevant AWS Competencies (see sections 7.0 and 10.0 for details)</li> 
<p>APN Partners entering the program, or MSP Partners renewing their program status, will be required to use Version 3.2 of the Validation Checklist for all audits as of April 1, 2018.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cadence.com/"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/13/APN-Partner-Success_featured-1-300x150.jpg" />Cadence Design Systems, Inc.</a>&nbsp;is a global technology company that supplies electronic design technology and engineering services to much of the semiconductor industry, including Fortune 100 companies. Cadence produces software, hardware, and silicon structures that are used to design integrated circuits, systems on chips (SoCs), and printed circuit boards.</p> 
<p>Cadence originally ran their own datacenters, but as the enterprise expanded&nbsp;they began to outgrow the computing capacity of the on-premises system. Their team understood prior to moving to the cloud the implications of securing a cloud environment as it scales. They sought to automate as many security tasks as possible while still proving to customers that their environment met high compliance industry standards, and that the security policies they created would be enforced.</p> 
<p>Cadence looked to Amazon Web Services (AWS) Advanced Technology Partner <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Dome9%20Security&amp;id=001E000000Rp584IAB">Dome9 Security</a>&nbsp;to build a system that would enable the company to scale up quickly, efficiently, and flexibly in response to large customer orders.&nbsp;Dome9 is one of the fastest growing born-in-the-cloud security startups fully hosted on AWS, and their Dome9 Arc platform delivers agentless software-as-a-service (SaaS) cloud security and compliance automation, advanced identity and access management (IAM) protection, and active protection for enterprises as they scale their AWS footprint.</p> 
<p><strong><a href="https://dome9.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Dome9-Cadence-Case-Study.pdf">Read the full Cadence-Dome9 case study &gt;&gt;</a></strong></p> 
<b>The Solution</b> 
<p>Cadence selected Dome9,&nbsp;which holds <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/" target="null">AWS Competencies</a> in <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/partner-solutions/" target="null">Security</a> and <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/networking/partner-solutions/" target="null">Networking</a>, to provide network security management and automated compliance. The Dome9 Arc platform has a&nbsp;deep visualization tool, Dome9 Clarity, which provides a granular view of customers’ AWS Cloud assets–Cadence has 770 security groups, 1,000 <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) instances, and 115 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a>&nbsp;(Amazon VPC) environments with real-time alerts in cases of misconfigurations.</p> 
<b>The Results</b> 
<p>With consolidated control over 50 AWS accounts in 3 AWS regions created by Dome9, Cadence can easily set up access for production teams, training sessions, and customers’ DevOps teams to specific subnets using Dome9 Dynamic Access Leases. These leases provide time-limited access to ports and services and immediately revert a port to closed once the lease has expired. Additionally, Cadence uses Dome9 active protection to enforce established security policies and keep regional data from being accessed by anyone outside of the defined region.</p> 
<p>Dome9’s network security management and automated compliance provides Cadence with many benefits:</p> 
<li><strong>Lower costs and accelerated time-to-market for products</strong>. Without Dome9, Cadence would have to spend an estimated $450,000 more annually on personnel and training.</li> 
<li><strong>Increased efficiency and agility</strong> allows their team to focus on higher level tasks.</li> 
<li><strong>Dome9’s robust platform is certified for ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type 2 compliance</strong>, in addition to providing continuous end-to-end compliance testing and reporting against industry standards and over 500 best practices. This allows Cadence to reassure customers that they are doing everything possible to keep their applications and data safe.</li>

<p>Analysts at C4ADS monitor worldwide events for patterns that warrant a&nbsp;deeper investigation, and their challenge was compounded by having to&nbsp;comb through a growing dataset that included data from different formats and sources.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=ClearScale&amp;id=001E000000Rl0wKIAR">ClearScale</a>, an AWS Premier Consulting Partner, reviewed various designs and approaches it could develop and implement on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to make the data more user-friendly for C4ADS analysts. The solution had to be implemented quickly, scale as needed, and be extremely secure given the nature of the information.</p> 
<p>To meet these requirements, ClearScale—which holds <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/">AWS Competencies</a> in Big Data, DevOps, Marketing &amp; Commerce, Mobile, Migration, and Internet of Things (IoT)—implemented a data lake approach within an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a> (Amazon VPC). The biggest challenge was aggregating multiple file formats (PDFs, emails, Microsoft Word and Excel files, logs, XML and JSON files) while still allowing C4ADS to perform easy searches within a large data repository. Unlike traditional data warehouse methodologies, a data lake allows for any number of data types to be stored and referenced as long as those types have a consistent approach to querying and retrieving data.</p> 
<p>Launched in October 2017, ClearScale’s solution has already optimized the analysts’ jobs by allowing them to do wide-ranging searches and aggregate disparate data types. Later releases will introduce more robust security measures, multi-lingual support, and optical character recognition (OCR) technology to aid in identification of important data markers.</p>

<p><em>By Aarthi Raju, Partner Solutions Architect at AWS</em></p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vmware/">VMware Cloud on AWS</a> enables customers to extend their on-premises data centers and easily migrate application workloads without having to convert machine image formats or undergo a re-platforming process.</p> 
<p>Customers no longer have to over-provision hardware resources to accommodate for host failures. Instead, you can increase utilization of the cluster resources as host failure replacement takes minutes, not days or weeks. You can also take advantage of instant on-demand capacity to meet temporary, seasonal, or unplanned demand by dynamically adding hosts to the cluster. With the recent VMware launch of Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) with VMware Site Recovery, customers can accelerate time-to-protection, simplify disaster recovery operations, and reduce the expense of maintaining additional physical data centers.</p> 
<p>VMware Cloud on AWS enables customers to run the VMware Software Defined Data Center (SDDC) stack, which includes vSphere, vSAN, NSX, and vCenter directly on bare-metal AWS infrastructure while maintaining the elasticity and security that customers demand. Customers can use their existing VMware skills while taking full advantage of running VMware workloads in the cloud.</p> 
<p>In this post, we dive deeper into the foundational blocks that make up this service.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/02/VMware-Architecture.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 1 – Overview of the foundational blocks of VMware Cloud on AWS. </em></p> 
<b>Compute</b> 
<p>An SDDC cluster can contain up to 10 vSphere clusters ranging in size from 4 to 32 hosts. Each host is configured with 512GB of memory and contains dual CPU sockets that are populated by a custom-built Intel Xeon Processor E5-2686 v4 CPU package. Each of these hosts contains 18 cores per socket (36 cores total with 72 threads per host) for a cluster core count of 144. Users can add or remove hosts with a simple click of a button or through an API call.</p> 
<b>Storage</b> 
<p>The primary storage for the SDDC cluster is backed by VMware’s vSAN (Virtual SAN) in an all-flash configuration. Each ESXi host comes with NVMe flash storage. A minimal 4 ESXi host cluster running vSAN provides approximately 21 TB usable storage, with all virtual machines protected against a single host failure (FTT=1). Data encryption at rest is built-in, without any user intervention. Users can leverage VMware’s SPBM (Storage Policy Based Management) VM storage policies at individual vdisk level.</p> 
<b>Networking</b> 
<p>VMware NSX is the network virtualization platform that enables customers to create a multi-tier virtual network. It allows customers to de-couple the network functions from the physical devices. In VMware Cloud on AWS, customers can use NSX to create their own logical networks. For every cluster, there are two logical networks by default–one for the management workloads and one for compute workloads.</p> 
<p>Communication between logical networks is achieved using gateways. The Management Gateway (MGW) utilizes VMware NSX Edge to enable users to connect to the vCenter Server instance. Customers can configure firewall rules, create IPSEC VPN and DNS for the management gateway. The Customer Gateway (CGW) utilizes a NSX Edge instance and a distributed logical router (DLR) to enable ingress and egress of VM network traffic.</p> 
<b>Connectivity</b> 
<p>The gateways discussed also enable connectivity from the SDDC cluster to on-premises environments. An IPSEC layer 3 VPN can be set up to securely connect the on-premise vCenter server with the management components running in the cloud SDDC cluster that enables capability such as hybrid linked mode for unified management. A separate layer 3 IPSEC VPN is set up to create connectivity between the on-premises workloads and VMs running in the cloud SDDC cluster.</p> 
<p>Customers can also leverage their existing AWS Direct Connect connection with VMware Cloud on AWS. This can be done by creating a hosted private Virtual Interface (VIF) for VMware Cloud on AWS. Currently, VMkernel traffic (ESX Management and vMotion) is carried over the private VIF. For all other traffic (management appliance traffic and workload VM traffic), customers can use the VPN connection already established.</p> 
<b>High Availability</b> 
<p>VMware vSphere High Availability (HA) provides high availability for VMs by leveraging hosts and resources of a cluster to reserve capacity. This way, workloads can failover in case of host failures. In the event of a failure, VMs on failed hosts are restarted on alternative hosts. VMware takes responsibility and will perform host failure remediation.</p> 
<b>Hybrid Linked Mode (HLM)</b> 
<p>A single pane of glass to view and manage on-premises as well as cloud environments is provided through vCenter Hybrid Linked Mode (HLM). This allows you to link the VMware Cloud on AWS vCenter to your on-premises vCenter to provide a hybrid management interface across cloud and on-premises resources. To take advantage of this feature, users need to be running vSphere 6.5 or later versions.</p> 
<b>Additional Resources</b> 
<p>VMware Cloud on AWS is delivered, sold, and supported by VMware as an on-demand, elastically-scalable cloud service that removes barriers to cloud migration and cloud portability, increases IT efficiency, and opens up new opportunities to leverage a hybrid cloud environment.&nbsp;The service is currently available in the AWS US West (Oregon), US East (N. Virginia), and London Regions.</p>

<p>As the move towards cloud accelerates, unsubstantiated fears about security are inhibiting the use of cloud services by some enterprises. A vital element of a successful cloud migration is understanding shared responsibilities between the organization and cloud service provider.&nbsp;In fact, Gartner predicts that, through 2020, 95 percent of cloud security failures will be the customer’s fault.*</p> 
<p>The security and monitoring tools offered by cloud providers include support for networking, database, storage, compute, and availability zones. However, analysis of customer packet data, which is critical for network security, is the customer’s responsibility.</p> 
<p>Other customer responsibilities outlined in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/">Shared Responsibility Model</a>&nbsp;include platform, application, identity and access management, operating system, network and firewall configuration, and the protection of data&nbsp;at rest and data in motion.</p> 
<b>Migration Strategies and Security</b> 
<p>There are multiple strategies for cloud migration—re-architecting for the cloud, building cloud-native, re-hosting (lift-and-shift), or re-platforming. Stephen Orban, who heads up enterprise strategy at Amazon Web Services (AWS), does a terrific job explaining trade-offs in his Medium post <a href="https://medium.com/aws-enterprise-collection/6-strategies-for-migrating-applications-to-the-cloud-eb4e85c412b4">6 Strategies for Migrating Applications to the Cloud</a>.</p> 
<p>Regardless of&nbsp;the approach, a successful migration depends on the security of your cloud environment, as well as application performance and fault tolerance, ease of use, cost, and the availability of vendor solutions for security analytics, applications, or network performance management.</p> 
<p>To support a distributed application architecture built to leverage the cloud’s full capabilities, there are several critical requirements for successful visibility and controls designed to provide security—capturing and filtering traffic, and allowing for horizontal scaling while providing pervasive data to tools.</p> 
<h3>Requirement 1: Access to Packet Data</h3> 
<p>In a traditional data center, there is physical access to the network so physical taps and network packet brokers can be used to access and filter data. In the cloud, however, the physical infrastructure is the responsibility of the service provider. Cloud-based applications are generally built as a collection of services that decouple the data from the application and are modeled to scale by spinning up additional instances and leveraging a pool of shared resources, when needed. This&nbsp;means control to the network domain is limited.</p> 
<p>A key customer requirement for moving workloads to the cloud is the need to employ independent, application-level monitoring and analytics of workload behavior. But the tools available to monitor the performance of your environment are virtual private cloud (VPC) flow logs or application metadata, both of which address some needs but do not provide the level of visibility that packet data does for complete clarity.<br /> <br /> </p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/03/MigStratSec.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 1 – A key customer requirement for moving workloads to the cloud is the need to employ independent, application-level monitoring and analytics of workload behavior. </em></p> 
<br /> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Requirement 2: Ability to Handle Complexity</h3> 
<p>Many organizations run tens of thousands of instances in the cloud. Often, these are logically separated into different VPCs, using metadata tags. Different departments or teams within an organization can build their own VPCs, leading to monitoring challenges. For example, it’s possible, even likely, there will be overlapping IP addresses in different VPCs. Managing thousands of instances and the amount of traffic this creates, while dealing with potential IP address overlap, must be considered in a cloud visibility architecture.</p> 
<h3>Requirement 3: Elastic Scale On-Demand</h3> 
<p>A well-architected cloud workload is designed to auto-scale to meet peak demand and contract when demand subsides. As applications scale to meet demand, new instances are created and destroyed dynamically. To be effective, a cloud visibility solution should accommodate the dynamic nature of events, without requiring manual VPC architecture changes or significantly modifying security group policies.</p> 
<h3>Requirement 4: Secure and High Availability Monitoring</h3> 
<p>To best expose native security capabilities of AWS, a visibility solution needs to integrate with the parameters available. One way to do this is to have visibility tools sit within the same VPC as workload instances. A key consideration for secure monitoring is ensuring that security policies configured for your workload and monitoring tool instances are applied to your AWS Cloud visibility.</p> 
<p>If cloud visibility management components are in a separate VPC, like when using a virtual machine, you would have to configure and manage the security of that environment separately, leaving room for error. If that visibility node goes down, all the traffic being monitored and delivered to tools will go missing. This results in missing critical security events or indicators of compromise/breach.</p> 
<h3>Requirement 5: Cost-Effective Solutions</h3> 
<p>Organizations migrate and adopt cloud services for many reasons, including cost-effectiveness. It is counterproductive to guess and size visibility for peak demand. A solution for cloud visibility should work like the cloud itself—pay-per-use and cost-effective. A non-cloud-native approach to visibility creates substantial incremental costs, including complexity costs in deploying, operating, and managing, ensuring uptime, and the potential lack of security capability. Each of theses requirements add to the total cost of ownership.</p> 
<b>CloudLens—a Solution for Complete Cloud Visibility</b> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Ixia&amp;id=001E000000UfZpqIAF">Ixia</a>, a Keysight business, is an AWS Advanced Technology Partner that holds the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/networking/partner-solutions/" title="undefined" target="null">AWS Networking Competency</a>.&nbsp;We have built <a href="https://www.ixiacom.com/products/cloudlens">CloudLens</a> to address cloud visibility with a cloud-native solution that is designed from the ground up to retain the cloud’s elastic scale, flexibility, and agility benefits.</p> 
<p>There are two components of CloudLens&nbsp;that work together to enable visibility in the cloud:</p> 
<li><strong>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) visibility management</strong>. This is where users can configure visibility and define filtering. It is accessible from anywhere and is always available. It has a simple, easy-to-use interface with drag-and drop functionality.</li> 
<li><strong>Sensors and connectors</strong>. Docker containers of software agents deployed within AWS source and tool virtual machine instances. Source instances are where users run their application workloads, and tool instances are where monitoring, analytics, or security forensics tools are deployed. The sensors and connectors are how CloudLens has full access to rich metadata because they sit within end user instances and communicate with each other over a secure VPN tunnel.</li> 
<p>CloudLens addresses the five requirements we started earlier in this post, because it does the following:</p> 
<li><strong>Provides access to packet data</strong>&nbsp;with the sensors that sit in source instances to mirror and filter packet data before forwarding to monitoring instances and tools.</li> 
<li><strong>Addresses complexity</strong> because sensors operate peer-to-peer, over a secure VPN tunnel, so they don’t require an additional VPC or modifications to any existing construct. This makes it easy&nbsp;without any architectural changes.</li> 
<li><strong>Elastically scales on-demand&nbsp;</strong>as instances are created and destroyed. CloudLens uses metadata from cloud platform instances to classify them. Because metadata inherently exists for each new instance created, the cloud platform automatically knows how to treat it and which security and monitoring policies need to be applied. An auto-scaling solution eliminates the burden of&nbsp;manual configuration, therefore mitigating the potential for error.</li> 
<li><strong>Provides secure and highly available monitoring </strong>because the sensors and connectors are deployed within a cloud virtual machine instance and adheres to the same security policies associated with that instance. CloudLens sensors always send packet data via a secure VPN tunnel.</li> 
<li><strong>Is cost-effective</strong> because it uses a pay-per-use model&nbsp;which tracks instances and can scale incrementally.</li> 
<p>All of this is possible in a single platform because CloudLens is built to be cloud-native. It applies the tenets of containerization, dynamic orchestration, and is built as microservices. In contrast, a lift and shift solution is limited in which of these requirements it can address, and to what extent.<br /> <br /> </p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/03/PurposeBuilt-1.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 2 – CloudLens is built on the cloud itself and applies the tenets of containerization, dynamic orchestration and is built as microservices.</em></p> 
<br /> 
<p></p> 
<b>Elastic Scale, Security, and Availability with CloudLens</b> 
<p>CloudLens meets the five requirements of cloud visibility because of how its designed. Let’s examine each of the components of CloudLens and highlight how we leverage the AWS Cloud to deliver elastic scale, high availability, and a secure management portal.</p> 
<p>AWS Lambda is at the core of CloudLens’s serverless architecture. AWS Lambda is designed to use replication and redundancy to provide high availability for both the service and the functions it operates, without maintenance windows or scheduled down times. Events are processed in milliseconds at whatever scale is required. These combined features are designed to provide high availability, virtually unlimited scale, rapid elasticity, and high reliability of the CloudLens management portal. This allows Ixia to deliver a true software-as-a-service, without requiring customers to provision and manage their own VPC environment for visibility management software.</p> 
<p>CloudLens leverages the Amazon API Gateway as a communication proxy, connecting CloudLens Docker agents and customer browser UI instances with our backend business logic. CloudLens Docker agents use API Gateway’s REST calls for management and cloud virtual instance metadata publication, while CloudLens UI session authentication and management also use the API Gateway. Examples of metadata collected by CloudLens agents include underlying instance architecture, operating system information, CPU and memory utilization, performance metrics, pre-populated user data, and network statistics.<br /> <br /> </p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/03/ElasticScale-1.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 3 – CloudLens is built on AWS and meets the five requirements of cloud visibility. AWS Lambda is at the core of CloudLens’s serverless architecture.</em></p> 
<br /> 
<br /> CloudLens uses the AWS IoT Core managed cloud platform to authenticate agents. It employs a bi-directional publish and subscribe model to allow agents to automatically “call home” to identify themselves to the backend portal. It also controls events to dynamically enforce configuration and operational changes on each CloudLens container. 
<p></p> 
<p>Amazon DynamoDB further supports and reinforces our cloud-native architecture to deliver a reliable, low latency service at any scale. Its flexible data model, reliable performance, and automatic scaling of throughput capacity with single millisecond latency makes DynamoDB a great fit to power our managed cloud visibility that can seamlessly scale to tens or hundreds of thousands instances, on demand, without impacting customer experience. AWS CodeCommit is also used to securely store customer environment configuration data.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, our integration with Zuora on AWS allows CloudLens to deliver usage-based pricing with on-demand rapid turn-up and a free 45-day trial.</p> 
<b>How CloudLens Works</b> 
<p>Configuring visibility begins by logging into CloudLens’s management portal and creating a Project. This creates a unique Project Key that is&nbsp;loaded into the visibility sensors running in the source and tool instances, which will be isolated as part of a Project. Once the key is installed in the visibility sensors, they phone home to the central management platform with metadata about the instances.</p> 
<p>The management interface has a smart search capability, which allows users to create source and tool groups based on metadata. This information is auto-populated as search criteria in the management platform. The metadata can also be user defined, allowing maximum flexibility. As new instances are created, they are automatically added to groups based on their metadata. This retains scalability and elasticity in a cloud visibility solution.<br /> <br /> </p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/03/CloudLensPMP-1.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 4 – Users can associate source groups with tool groups to create an encrypted secure visibility path. In CloudLens, this is done in a point-and-click visual interface. </em></p> 
<br /> 
<br /> The next step in configuration is for users to associate source groups with tool groups to create an encrypted secure visibility path. In CloudLens, this is done in a point-and-click visual interface as shown in 
<em>Figure 4</em>. Once defined, the secure visibility path transfers filtered packet data from source to tool instances. 
<p></p> 
<p>Together, the sensor, management platform, and secure visibility path address the challenge of providing visibility within AWS.</p> 
<b>Next Steps</b> 
<p>As enterprises move to AWS, visibility solutions that provide security and compliance are required. To scale, filtering rules cannot be static; rather they must be based on workload attributes and type of traffic. Ixia’s CloudLens has a serverless architecture that scales with distributed software systems built for cloud scale, which delivers intelligent, resilient, and proactive cloud visibility.</p>
