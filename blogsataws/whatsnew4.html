<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jul 31, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>AWS CloudTrail now enables you to download CloudTrail account activity history from within the CloudTrail console. Previously, you could only analyze or share account activity offline by using the CloudTrail LookupEvents API, copying and pasting relevant information directly from the CloudTrail console, or searching the CloudTrail S3 bucket for the correct log files. Now, you can download your account activity to a CSV or JSON formatted file. You can use the downloaded files to analyze account activity with 3rd party tools or to backup and store activity history offline. Please visit <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/cloudtrail/" target="_blank">AWS CloudTrail documentation</a> page for more information.<br /> </p> 
<p>AWS CloudTrail account history download feature is available in AWS GovCloud (US), China (Beijing), and all AWS public regions. Please visit <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ct_region" target="_blank">here</a> to see the full list of supported regions.</p>

<p>You can now provision and manage resources for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/analytics/">Amazon Kinesis Analytics</a> applications using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation</a>. With AWS CloudFormation, you can easily provision and update a set of related AWS resources in an orderly and predictable fashion.</p> 
<p>Kinesis Analytics is the easiest way to process streaming data in real time with standard SQL without having to learn new programming languages or processing frameworks. Kinesis Analytics enables you to query streaming data or build entire streaming applications using SQL, so that you can gain actionable insights and respond to your business and customer needs promptly. Kinesis Analytics is available in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and EU (Ireland) regions.</p> 
<p>Customers can use AWS CloudFormation to create templates that easily create or update Kinesis Analytics applications. Typically, a template is used as a way to manage code across different environments or to quickly prototype a new streaming data solution.</p> 
<p>To learn more about this feature, see our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/aws-cloudformation-supports-amazon-kinesis-analytics-applications/">AWS Big Data Blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) now allows customers to create a new default VPC directly from the console or by using the CLI. With this release, customers no longer need to contact AWS support if the default VPC has been deleted, as they can create a new default VPC by using this self-service feature. Customers can also take remedial actions against accidental deletion of default VPCs, by automating creation of a new default VPC using the API.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This feature is available in all AWS regions. </p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jul 27, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon Inspector is excited to announce the launch of Assessment Events. Through an integration with Amazon CloudWatch Events, customers can now create events that automatically trigger Amazon Inspector assessments to run against your environments. Within Amazon CloudWatch Events, you can now create event rules that target your Amazon Inspector assessment templates. When that CloudWatch Event occurs, Amazon Inspector will automatically be notified to run the specified assessment.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon Inspector assessments can be triggered by any CloudWatch Event. You can set up a recurring Schedule event with either a simple fixed recurring rate or a more detailed Cron expression, or create an event pattern which monitors other AWS services for actions to trigger an assessment. For example, you can create an event which monitors AWS Auto Scaling for new EC2 Instances being launched, or monitors AWS CodeDeploy notifications for when a code deployment has been successfully completed. Once CloudWatch Events have been configured against Amazon Inspector templates, these assessment events will be displayed in the Inspector console as part of your assessment templates so you can see all of the automated triggers for that assessment.</p> 
<p>For more information, visit the Amazon Inspector <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/">site</a>. To get started, simply login to the <a href="https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/inspector/home?region=ap-southeast-2#/home">Amazon Inspector Console</a> and configure an assessment.

<p>Today, Amazon AppStream 2.0 is introducing Graphics Desktop and Graphics Pro instance families to deliver high performance graphics applications from AWS. These new graphics instance families allow you to stream powerful graphics applications to a web browser on any desktop, eliminating the need for expensive and bulky workstations. Applications are delivered remotely using NICE DCV, a secure hi-fidelity streaming protocol that is specially tuned for graphics workloads. Since graphics applications can now be run next to data that is stored on AWS, designers, engineers, and analysts using AppStream 2.0 can benefit from a high quality, low latency visualization experience for their 2D and 3D workloads. AppStream 2.0 provides secure, anywhere, anytime access, so your users can use the software and data they need to be productive, wherever there is a web connection. In addition, software developers can move their desktop applications to the cloud without rewriting code, creating new distribution channels and subscription services.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Graphics Desktop instance family offers a single instance type with an NVIDIA GPU based on K520 with 1,536 CUDA cores, 8 vCPUs, 15 GiB system memory, and 4 GiB graphics memory. This instance type is ideal for running desktop graphics applications such as Siemens NX, SolidWorks, ESRI ArcGIS, and other applications that use DirectX, OpenGL, OpenCL, and CUDA. The Graphics Desktop family is a powerful yet economical choice, with pricing that starts at tens-of-cents per hour.<br /> </p> 
<p>The Graphics Pro instance family offers three different instance types to support the most demanding graphics applications. Powered by NVIDIA Tesla M60 GPUs with 2048 parallel processing cores, there are three Graphics Pro instances types starting from 16 vCPUs, 122 GiB system memory, and 8 GiB graphics memory, to 64 vCPUs, 488 GiB system memory, and 32 GiB graphics memory. These instance types are ideal for graphic workloads that need a massive amount of parallel processing power for 3D rendering, visualization, and video encoding, including applications such as Petrel from Schlumberger Software, Landmark's DecisionSpace, or MotionDSP's Ikena.</p> 
<p>You can select an AppStream 2.0 Graphics Desktop or Graphics Pro instance when launching an image builder instance or creating a fleet from the AWS management console, or using the AWS SDK. When you select a graphics instance for your image builder, you can install your applications, verify performance on the instance type and size you selected, and fine tune your applications to optimize the user experience. You can then create your fleet using the instance size you need to meet your application performance requirements.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jul 24, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet now supports user tags that will automatically propagate to instances launched by your Fleets. This makes it easier for Spot Fleet customers to track ownership, drive their cost accounting processes, implement compliance protocols, and to control access to Spot instances via IAM policies.</p> 
<p>Previously, if you wanted to tag instances launched by Spot Fleet you had to write and manage custom code. Now you can provide up to 50 user tags per launch specification and let Spot Fleet automatically tag instances it launches on your behalf.</p> 
<p> Tags enable you to categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. This is useful when you have many resources of the same type — you can quickly identify a specific resource based on the tags you've assigned to it. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's Amazon EC2 instances that helps you track each instance's owner and stack level.</p> 
<p> Tagging is available today in all regions where Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet is available. For more information, click <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Amazon EC2 X1 instances are now available for use in China (Beijing) and South America (S&atilde;o Paulo) Regions.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>X1 Instances are designed for running large-scale, in-memory applications and in-memory databases in the AWS cloud. Offering up to 1,952 GiB of memory and 128 vCPUs, X1 instances are ideal for running in-memory databases like SAP HANA, big data processing engines like Apache Spark or Presto, and high performance computing (HPC) applications. X1 instances are certified by SAP to run production environments of the next-generation Business Suite S/4HANA, Business Suite on HANA (SoH), Business Warehouse on HANA (BW), and Data Mart Solutions on HANA on the AWS Cloud.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jul 20, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Two weeks ago, we launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/newly-updated-features-in-the-aws-iam-console-help-you-adhere-to-iam-best-practices/" target="_blank">updates to the user list page</a> by adding new information that helps you adhere to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practices. In March, we <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/move-over-json-policy-summaries-make-understanding-iam-policies-easier/" target="_blank">introduced policy summaries</a>, which make it easier for you to understand the permissions in your IAM policies.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Today, we improved the way you work with both of these new features by enabling the IAM console to remember your preferences for table column selections and IAM policy viewing and editing.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now when you select columns on the users list or policy list pages, the console will remember your selection and render these columns the next time you load that page. The IAM console also will remember if you last viewed a policy using the policy summary view or the JSON view. The next time you view any policy, the console will render the policy using your preferred view. Finally, the IAM console now remembers your preference for the Use autoformatting for policy editing setting, which determines whether the JSON of an IAM policy is automatically formatted or left unformatted when you save it.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These features are now available in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">all regions</a> except the AWS GovCloud (US) and the AWS China Regions. If you have feedback about the IAM console experience, let us know through the in-console feedback form or by starting a new thread on the <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=76" target="_blank">IAM forum</a>.</p>

<p>Lambda@Edge is now generally available for all customers. You can use this new AWS Lambda feature to run Node.js functions across AWS locations globally without provisioning or managing servers, allowing you to deliver richer, more personalized content with low latency to your customers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You just upload your code to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> and configure it to be triggered by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon CloudFront events</a> (i.e., viewer request, viewer response, origin request, and origin response). When a related request is received by CloudFront, it is routed to the optimal AWS location close to the viewer for execution. Lambda@Edge then executes your code, and scales with the volume of requests across CloudFront’s global network. With Lambda@Edge, you can run code to customize web pages based on each individual request, create custom authentication logic that executes globally and simplify the delivery of secure custom headers. In addition, you can now make remote network calls to access resources on the internet on origin facing events, and generate dynamic web content from scratch realtime and inline with your requests. Together, this functionality allows customers to deliver richer, more personalized content at low latencies for their end users.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Lambda@Edge functions can now be authored in US East (N. Virginia), and will be replicated globally for invocation in response to CloudFront events. &nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jul 13, 2017</span> </p> 
<p> The Classic Load Balancers now support four new metrics in CloudWatch. The metrics allow you to infer your bill if you used the Application Load Balancer for the same traffic profile instead of the Classic Load Balancer. This makes it easy for you to migrate from Classic to the Application Load Balancer.</p> 
<p> The Application Load Balancer billing is based on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/applicationloadbalancer/pricing/#LCU_Details">Load Balancer Capacity Unit (LCU)</a> metrics. The new CloudWatch metrics for Classic Load Balancer namely, EstimatedProcessedBytes, EstimatedALBActiveConnectionCount, and EstimatedALBNewConnectionCount give you visibility into traffic profile in each of the dimensions that constitute an LCU. The fourth metric, EstimatedALBConsumedLCUs gives you the estimated LCU count that your traffic will be billed if you use an Application Load Balancer. The four metrics are approximations and the sole purpose of these metrics is to give you an estimate of your bill if you were to transition from Classic to the Application Load Balancer.</p> 
<p> All four metrics are enabled on all new and existing Classic Load Balancers and can be accessed from the Load Balancer and CloudWatch console. The metrics are available in all public AWS regions. You can learn more by visiting the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-cloudwatch-metrics.html#estimated-metrics">CloudWatch Metrics page</a> for your Classic Load Balancers.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jul 12, 2017</span> </p> 
<p> Amazon EC2 Systems Manager now supports cross-platform documents, and now you can use multiple steps of the same type in the same document.</p> 
<p>Previously, you had to maintain separate platform specific documents in order to run the same steps, or plugins, on Windows and Linux instances. Now, by adding a precondition that specifies the platform type, you can run steps for both Windows and Linux instances in the same document. For example, you can now update all Windows and Linux instances using one document, such as AWS-RunPatchBaseline, by identifying the appropriate platform for each step in the precondition. This improvement allows you to maintain all of your Windows and Linux instances with fewer documents to manage.</p> 
<p> Additionally, you can now use multiple steps of the same type in the same document. This allows you to use Windows and Linux specific steps, for example when you want to join a Windows instance to a domain and collect metrics for your Linux web server, all in the same document. With multiple steps of the same type, you can create before and after actions. For example, before patching you can remove an instance from an auto scaling group, patch, then add the instance back.</p> 
<p> To use cross-platform and multi-step documents, you first need to update to the latest agent. You can see how to do this in our <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html">documentation</a>.

<b id="Introducing_Target_Tracking_Scaling_Policies_for_Auto_Scaling"> <a name="Introducing_Target_Tracking_Scaling_Policies_for_Auto_Scaling"> Introducing Target Tracking Scaling Policies for Auto Scaling</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jul 12, 2017</span> </p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/">Auto Scaling</a> now supports a new type of scaling policy called target tracking scaling policies that you can use to set up dynamic scaling for your application in just a few simple steps. Adding Auto Scaling to your application is one way to maximize the benefits of AWS. Auto Scaling helps you build systems that respond to changes in demand by automatically launching or terminating Amazon EC2 instances based on conditions that you define. This dynamic scaling helps to improve application availability and reduce costs. For example, you can use Auto Scaling to automatically launch EC2 instances for your Auto Scaling group when demand increases to help maintain performance, and terminate instances when demand drops to save money.</p> 
<p> With target tracking, you select a load metric for your application, such as “Average CPU Utilization” or the new “Request Count Per Target” metric from Application Load Balancer, set the target value, and Auto Scaling adjusts the number of EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling group as needed to maintain that target. It acts like a home thermostat, automatically adjusting the system to keep the environment at your desired temperature. For example, you can configure target tracking to keep CPU utilization for your fleet of web servers at 50%. From there, Auto Scaling launches or terminates EC2 instances as required to keep the average CPU utilization at 50%.</p> 
<p>Auto Scaling is available at no additional charge. Target tracking scaling policies are currently available for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> in all regions. You can also use target tracking scaling policies with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/06/announcing-amazon-dynamodb-auto-scaling/">Application Auto Scaling for Amazon DynamoDB</a> today, and with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/#application">Application Auto Scaling for other AWS services</a> in the coming months.</p> 
<p> You can get started with target tracking scaling policies for Auto Scaling using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or AWS SDK.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jul 12, 2017</span> </p> 
<p> We are pleased to announce that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/">Elastic Load Balancing</a> now supports a new CloudWatch metric called RequestCountPerTarget for Application Load Balancers. The RequestCountPerTarget metric value indicates the average number of requests received by each target in a target group associated with an Application Load Balancer during a specified time period.</p> 
<p> This metric is an indicator of load on an individual application backend during a given time window and can be used by Auto Scaling or your own custom scaling system to set up dynamic scaling for your application. This will help you maintain application performance, improve application availability and reduce costs.</p> 
<p> This metric is integrated with Auto Scaling through a new type of scaling policy called target tracking scaling policies where you select this metric as a load metric for your application, set the target value, and Auto Scaling adjusts the number of EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling group as needed to maintain that target value. For example, you can configure target tracking scaling policy for your Auto Scaling Group to keep RequestCountPerTarget at 1000 for your webserver fleet. From there, Auto Scaling launches or terminates EC2 instances as required to keep RequestCountPerTarget at 1000.</p>

<p> Patch Manager, part of Amazon EC2 Systems Manager, can now patch Amazon Linux, RHEL, and Ubuntu distributions on your managed instances.</p> 
<p> Previously, Patch Manager only supported Windows managed instances. If you wanted to patch Linux managed instances, you needed to use in-house or Linux distribution-specific tools. Now, you can manage Linux patches for AWS and on-premises managed instances using the same tool as you do for Windows. Just like with Windows patching, Patch Manager lets you automate your Linux patching process using defined auto-approval rules, which lets you only deploy vetted packages. This also gives you a single patch compliance view for both your Linux and Windows managed instances. </p> 
<p> Systems Manager is available in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">all regions</a>. Supported Linux distribution version numbers are available in our <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-patch.html">documentation</a>.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jul 6, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>You can now encrypt data in your <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/">Amazon Kinesis</a> streams using server-side encryption and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">AWS Key Management Service</a> (KMS) keys. Server-side encryption makes it easy to meet strict data management requirements by encrypting your data at rest within <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/streams/">Kinesis Streams</a>.</p> 
<p>To get started, select a new or existing Kinesis stream in the Kinesis management console, select a KMS master key, and enable server-side encryption. Within a few seconds, Kinesis Streams encrypts all incoming data written to the stream. Server-side encryption uses the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256 GCM algorithm) to encrypt each record and its partition key.</p> 
<p>You can use the Kinesis management console or the AWS SDK to get the encryption status of a stream, and check if a specific read or write operation was encrypted. You can also audit the encryption history using AWS CloudTrail.</p> 
<p>Server-side encryption is a free Kinesis Streams feature, however standard KMS key and usage costs apply. For details, see the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/pricing/">AWS KMS pricing page</a>. Server-side encryption is available in US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California and Oregon), EU (Ireland), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), and Asia Pacific (Singapore) regions. Support for server-side encryption in other regions is coming soon.</p> 
<p>To learn more about server-side encryption, see the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/streams/faqs/#kinesis-encryption">Kinesis Streams FAQ page</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/server-side-encryption.html">Server-Side Encryption</a> in the Kinesis Streams Developer Guide.</p>

<p>This new Quick Start automatically deploys DataStax Enterprise (DSE) on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in 30 minutes or less, into a configuration of your choice.</p> 
<p>DSE is the always-on data platform for cloud applications that is powered by Apache Cassandra. DSE is designed to handle big data workloads across multiple nodes with no single point of failure, by employing a peer-to-peer distributed system for data across homogeneous nodes. Integrated within each node of DSE is powerful indexing, search, analytics, and graph functionality, provided by combining Cassandra with Apache Solr, Apache Spark, and DSE Graph.</p> 
<p> This Quick Start uses AWS CloudFormation templates to deploy DSE into a virtual private cloud (VPC) in your AWS account. You can build a new VPC for DSE, or deploy the software into your existing VPC. The automated deployment provisions an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance running DSE OpsCenter, which is the web console for managing DSE clusters. The Quick Start also provisions EC2 instances for up to four DSE data centers to support workload separation, and sets up a configurable number of nodes in each data center. You can also customize your network resources, and modify the instance type and volume size for each node. </p> 
<p> The Quick Start includes a guide with step-by-step deployment and configuration instructions. To get started, use the following resources:</p>

<p>AWS Config now supports pre-built and custom rules in South America (Sao Paulo) and Canada (Central) regions.</p> 
<p>AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. Config provides you with pre-built rules for evaluating provisioning and configuring of your AWS resources as well as software within managed instances, including Amazon EC2 instances and servers running on-premises. You can configure pre-built rules to evaluate your AWS resource configurations and configuration changes, or create your own custom rules that define your internal best practices and guidelines for resource configurations.</p> 
<p>With this launch, AWS Config rules are now available in all public AWS regions: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), EU (Frankfurt), EU (Ireland), EU (London), South America (Sao Paulo) and Canada (Central).</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jul 5, 2017</span> </p> 
<p> Today, we made it easier for you to follow <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> best practices by adding additional information in the Users section of the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home">IAM console</a>. This new information in the IAM user table helps you monitor user activity in your AWS account and identify access keys and passwords that should be <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#rotate-credentials">rotated regularly</a>. It also enables you to better audit users’ MFA device usage, and gives you better visibility into users’ group memberships. This information is available in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS regions</a> today.</p> 
<p> To learn more about the new information added to the users section in the IAM console, see the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/newly-updated-features-in-the-aws-iam-console-help-you-adhere-to-iam-best-practices/">AWS Security Blog</a>.</p>

<p>Email flow rules can be applied based on specific email addresses, or entire email domains. You can configure email flow rules from the Amazon WorkMail console.</p> 
<p>You can use email flow rules in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS Regions</a> where WorkMail is offered, and at no additional charge.
