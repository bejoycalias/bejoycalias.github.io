<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jan 26, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>AWS SAM extends AWS CloudFormation to provide a simplified way of defining the Amazon API Gateway APIs, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB tables needed by your serverless application. Now, you can use new resource types to write CloudFormation templates that are optimized for defining serverless applications with only a few lines of text.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With AWS SAM support, you can use the AWS CloudFormation CLI to package and deploy serverless applications and use the CLI tool <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/test-sam-local.html" target="_blank">AWS SAM Local</a>, available in beta, to locally test and debug your AWS Lambda functions defined by AWS SAM templates.</p> 
<p>The easiest way to get started using AWS SAM for your serverless applications is with AWS developer tools. You can use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/">AWS Codestar</a> to find SAM templates that let you quickly and easily set up and deploy serverless applications. You can also use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">AWS Cloud9</a>, a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that comes pre-installed with AWS SAM Local, for local testing and debugging Lambda functions. AWS SAM is also supported by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/">AWS CodeDeploy</a> which helps you automatically manage the rollout of new function versions. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>The AWS Serverless Application Model is made available under the Apache 2.0 license, enabling others in the ecosystem to adopt and incorporate it into build, deployment, monitoring and management tools with a commercial-friendly license.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>AWS SAM is now available in all regions where Lambda is available. For more information on where AWS Lambda is available, see the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS region table</a>. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>To learn more about using AWS SAM to build serverless applications, visit our <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/deploying-lambda-apps.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> and check out the model on <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-specification" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jan 26, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon EC2 customers can now utilize up to five times higher bandwidth when sending or receiving network traffic between an instance and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (S3) within the same region. They can also utilize higher bandwidth for traffic between instances in different Availability Zones. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Until now, such instances were limited to a maximum of 5 Gbps for traffic outside of a cluster placement group. With this update, customers can now use the full network bandwidth available on each instance for more workloads, such as applications that require ingestion of high volumes of data from S3 or do periodic backups of data to S3. Multi-AZ application deployments requiring high throughput data transfer for replication will also benefit from these improvements. All current generation instances using Enhanced Networking, including those already running, can take advantage of these performance improvements without any additional steps.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jan 26, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon Connect customers can now use federated single sign-on (SSO) using SAML 2.0 to access Amazon Connect. This allows contact center agents and managers to access Amazon Connect with their existing corporate credentials. As an administrator, you can enforce password policies, and use your existing SAML 2.0 user directory to control access to Amazon Connect, based on location, the device they are using, or their role.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can enable federated access and controls via any SAML 2.0 compliant identity provider such as Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services, Okta, Ping Identity, and Shibboleth. Once this is done, agents and managers can sign in to Amazon Connect through your identity provider portal with a single click, and without a separate username and password for Amazon Connect.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Federated SSO using SAML 2.0 is available for Amazon Connect in preview, in all the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS regions</a> where Amazon Connect is offered. To request participation in the Amazon Connect SAML 2.0 preview, please apply <a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/connect-samlpreview.html" target="_blank">here</a>. There are no additional charges for using SAML 2.0 with Amazon Connect. To learn more about Amazon Connect, a self-service, cloud <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-a-contact-center/">contact center</a>, please visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/connect/">Amazon Connect website</a>.</p>

This rule helps improve security posture of your AWS CodeBuild projects.<br /> </li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li>codebuild-project-source-repo-url-check<br />

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jan 25, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon EC2 Spot can now hibernate EBS-backed Amazon EC2 C5 and M5 instances in the event of an interruption. Spot instances can fulfill your request by resuming instances from a hibernated state when capacity is available. Hibernate is just like closing and opening your laptop lid, with your application starting up right where it left off.<br /> </p> 
<p>This feature is now available on C5 and M5 instance families with memory (RAM) of less than 100 GB running Amazon Linux, Ubuntu and Microsoft Windows operating systems. Hibernation has been available for C3, C4, M4, R3 and R4 instance families since Nov 28, 2017.<br /> </p> 
<p>Upon hibernation, Spot instances will persist your EBS root volume and any other attached EBS data volumes between sessions. Additionally, data from memory (RAM) is also saved to your EBS root volume. Upon restart, your EBS root device is restored from its prior state, including the RAM content. Previously attached data volumes are reattached and the instance retains its instance ID. You will not be charged for instance usage while your instance is hibernated. Storage is charged at standard EBS storage rates. You can cancel your Spot request at any time in order to terminate hibernated instances.<br /> </p> 
<p>The feature is available for persistent Spot instance requests and Spot Fleets with maintain fleet option enabled.

<p>Starting today, you can view your amortized reservation costs in AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Cost &amp; Usage Reports, as well as monitor those costs via AWS Budgets. This makes it easier to understand and control the comprehensive costs of workloads covered by your Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon DynamoDB reservations.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When purchasing an Upfront or Partial Upfront reservation, you receive a significant discount by paying in advance of any qualifying resource usage. Because upfront costs are recorded at the time they are charged rather than at the time of associated usage, it can be difficult to understand how to apportion those costs across workloads covered by a reservation in order to determine their amortized cost. Using Cost Explorer, you can now easily track your amortized costs using the advanced options, as all upfront fees are amortized over the duration of the reservation lease and applied to the resource usage covered by that reservation. For example, when tracking a number of projects using a “Project” tag, switching to the amortized cost view and grouping by the “Project” tag will present the comprehensive cost, including the amortized portion of associated upfront fees, of each project over the user-defined time interval. Please note that this information is available programmatically via the AWS Cost Explorer API, and is also accessible via the AWS Cost &amp; Usage Reports.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Additionally, using AWS Budgets, you can monitor your amortized costs by setting budgets that track against your user-defined thresholds.</p> 
<p>To learn more about amortized costs, you can refer to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/amortizing-ri.html" target="_blank">Amortizing Reserved Instances</a> user guide or visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/">AWS Cost Management</a> webpages.</p>

This release fixes <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1801/">three PostgreSQL security vulnerabilities</a> and contains additional bug fixes and improvements.<br /> </p> 
<p>With this update, we have also <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_PostgreSQL.html#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.version966">added support</a> for the ‘orafce’ extension to emulate a subset of common functions and packages in version 9.6.6; and the ‘prefix’ extension to provide prefix range functions capability in version 9.6.6 .</p> 
<p>To use the new versions, you can create a new Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL database instance with just a few clicks in the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home">AWS Management Console</a>, or upgrade an existing instance using point-and-click upgrades. An upgrade operation involves a short period of unavailability for your database instance. Learn more about upgrading your database instances from the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Upgrading.html#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.PostgreSQL">Amazon RDS User Guide</a>.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jan 19, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>This new Quick Start automatically deploys TIBCO Enterprise Message Service (EMS) into a customizable environment on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud, using Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) for shared storage.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>TIBCO EMS implements the Java Message Service (JMS) framework to provide a uniform messaging interface for enterprise applications. It connects other messaging services, such as TIBCO Rendezvous and TIBCO FTL, directly, and integrates with other application types and services by using TIBCO BusinessWorks.</p> 
<p>AWS extends the capabilities of TIBCO EMS by enabling applications running on different Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to communicate easily. With Amazon EFS, AWS also removes the need to have dedicated hardware or expensive disk arrays (SAN or NAS) for shared storage, while providing a complete fault-tolerant environment for all messages.</p> 
<p>To get started with TIBCO EMS on AWS:</p> 
<li>View the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/tibco-ems/" target="_blank">architecture and details</a></li> 
<li>View the <a href="https://fwd.aws/VRza9" target="_blank">deployment guide</a> for step-by-step instructions</li>

<p>Amazon Athena uses Presto, an open source distributed query engine, to run SQL queries against data in Amazon S3. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage, and you pay only for the queries you run. We are happy to announce that we have transparently updated Athena's underlying engine to a version based on Presto 0.172. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>With the upgrade, you can now use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/functions-operators-reference-section.html">Functions and Operators</a> supported by Presto version 0.172, including <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/functions-operators-reference-section.html">Lambda expressions</a>. Lambda expressions make it simple and quick to define arbitrary inline transformations on elements of complex data types, without having to write complex SQL code to achieve the same thing. Also included, is an ability to ignore headers by using “skip.header.line.count” in table properties for CSV files. </p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jan 18, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>You can now use Amazon SageMaker’s BlazingText implementation of the Word2Vec algorithm to generate word embeddings from a large number of documents. Word embeddings represent each unique word in the entire collection of text documents as a vector of numbers. Words that are similar will have similar vectors – that is, they will be close in the low-dimensional space of the embeddings – while words that are less similar will be further apart. This algorithm is used in a variety of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks, such as semantic similarity, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question-answering. Word2Vec has also recently been used successfully in tasks like recommendation and segmentation, where similar embeddings may denote that, by example, two movies tend to be watched by similar users at similar times. Amazon SageMaker’s BlazingText implementation has been engineered with speed and scale in mind to produce embeddings extremely fast using either GPU or CPU hardware.<br /> </p> 
<p>The BlazingText implementation of the Word2Vec algorithm is available today in the US East (N. Virginia &amp; Ohio), EU (Ireland) and U.S. West (Oregon) AWS regions.

<p>You can now publish logs from your RDS for MySQL and MariaDB databases to CloudWatch Logs. Supported logs include general log, slow query log, audit log, and error log. Publishing these logs to CloudWatch Logs allows you to maintain continuous visibility into database activity, query performance, and errors in your RDS for MySQL and MariaDB databases. For example, you can set up CloudWatch Alarms to notify you on frequent restarts which are recorded in the error log. Similarly, alarms for events recorded in general or audit logs can be created to alert on unwanted changes made to your databases. You may also create alarms to monitor the slow query log and enable timely detection of long-running queries.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>CloudWatch Logs provide a durable archive destination for your database logs. You can specify a retention period to indicate how long you want CloudWatch to retain your logs. Additionally, with CloudWatch Logs, you can perform ad hoc searches across multiple logs. This capability is particularly useful for troubleshooting, audits, and log analysis.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jan 12, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>This new Quick Start automatically creates a secure deployment of IBM WebSphere Liberty into a customizable environment on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in about 40 minutes. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WebSphere Liberty is a fast, dynamic, and easy-to-use Java application server that combines IBM technology with open-source software built on the <a href="http://openliberty.io/" target="_blank">Open Liberty Project</a>. WebSphere Liberty has a flexible, modular runtime, and can be extended or integrated with frameworks such as Docker, Chef, Puppet, Jenkins, and UrbanCode Deploy.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>WebSphere Liberty provides a solid foundation for developing and running service-oriented architecture (SOA) applications on AWS, because of its fast startup times, ability to pick up changes without server restarts, and simple XML configuration. The Quick Start deploys WebSphere Liberty servers in a highly available, Multi-AZ environment. It configures Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing, so you can scale instance capacity up or down, based on CPU thresholds that you specify. Amazon CloudFront is included as an optional content delivery service, to enable caching of static content at edge locations. This architecture also includes an end-to-end SSL/TLS implementation using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) Certificates. &nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jan 11, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon Inspector has released an enhancement to the Inspector Agent that will allow it to perform assessments for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks, and AWS Security Best Practices on supported operating systems, regardless of the kernel version installed. Prior to this release, the Inspector Agent was dependent on an internal kernel module that supported specific Linux OS kernel versions. The Inspector Agent could not be installed or used to run any security assessments for supported Linux operating systems that were using non-default, older, or custom kernels. With this update, you can use any kernel and run those assessments.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You will still need a compatible kernel to run the Runtime Behavior Analysis rules package due to the nature of that assessment. Runtime Behavior Analysis actively monitors the OS and installed applications behavior over a defined period, which requires access to the operating system kernel in order to gather the required telemetry data. To see a list of compatible kernel versions, go <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_supported_os_regions.html#inspector_supported-linux-os" target="_blank">here</a>. If your assessment template includes Runtime Behavior Analysis, and any of your instances have an unsupported kernel version, Inspector will complete the assessment and issue an informational finding for those instances letting you know that the Runtime Behavioral Analysis rules package is not supported for that kernel version.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jan 11, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Starting today, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon RDS</a> Read Replicas for MySQL and MariaDB now support Multi-AZ deployments. Combining Read Replicas with Multi-AZ enables you to build a resilient disaster recovery strategy and simplify your database engine upgrade process.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/read-replicas/">Amazon RDS Read Replicas</a> enable you to create one or more read-only copies of your database instance within the same AWS Region or in a different AWS Region. Updates made to the source database are then asynchronously copied to your Read Replicas. In addition to providing scalability for read-heavy workloads, Read Replicas can be promoted to become a standalone database instance when needed.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/multi-az/">Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments</a> provide enhanced availability for database instances within a single AWS Region. With Multi-AZ, your data is synchronously replicated to a standby in a different Availability Zone (AZ). In the event of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, minimizing disruption to your applications.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can now use Read Replicas with Multi-AZ as part of a disaster recovery (DR) strategy for your production databases. A well-designed and tested DR plan is critical for maintaining business continuity after a disaster. A Read Replica in a different region than the source database can be used as a standby database and promoted to become the new production database in case of a regional disruption.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can also combine Read Replicas with Multi-AZ for your database engine upgrade process. You can create a Read Replica of your production database instance and upgrade it to a new database engine version. When the upgrade is complete, you can stop applications, promote the Read Replica to a standalone database instance, and switch over your applications. Since the database instance is already a Multi-AZ deployment, no additional steps are needed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can now use the DeepAR forecasting algorithm for model training in Amazon SageMaker.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>DeepAR is an algorithm that generates accurate forecasts by learning patterns from time-series over multiple large sets of training data with related time-series. The DeepAR algorithm learns similarities across the related&nbsp;items in the dataset to provide more accurate forecasts. This method improves upon common forecasting methods like Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models or exponential smoothing which treat each time-series independently. By using the shared information across related time-series, DeepAR can be applied to a number of time-series challenges, such as predicting future product sales to improve supply chain management, forecasting traffic to servers or web pages, or estimating future electricity consumption at the individual household level.</p> 
<p>The DeepAR algorithm is available today in the US East (N. Virginia &amp; Ohio), EU (Ireland) and U.S. West (Oregon) AWS regions.
