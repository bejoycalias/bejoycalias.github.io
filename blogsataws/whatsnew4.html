<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Sep 29, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>We’re excited to announce the availability of Lumberyard Beta 1.11. With over 412 improvements, fixes, and features, this release introduces two new tools to help game teams create high quality and complex gameplay with less engineering resources. Additionally, Lumberyard Beta 1.11 adds new AWS integrations so game developers can add text-to-speech and speech recognition to their game experiences. Some highlights include: &nbsp;</p> 
<li>EMotion FX Animation. Animators can create high quality character animations in 10 minutes with little to no engineering chops, and use advanced functionality like blendtrees, state machines, blendspaces, and motion extraction.</li> 
<li>Script Canvas. Script Canvas enables non-engineers to author behaviors using drag and drop visual scripting, while utilizing the same framework as Lua and C++. <br /> </li> 
<li>3 new Cloud Gems, giving developers the ability to easily capture in-game surveys from players, a text to speech gem that leverages Amazon Polly to generate lifelike speech, as well as a gem to build speech recognition and conversational gameplay experiences using Amazon Lex. <br /> </li> 
<li>Much more, including usability enhancements to the Entity Outliner and Asset Browser, a new toon shader for cartoon-like graphics, a new getting started guide, and more.</li> 
<p>For more information on this release, you can read the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/gamedev/1-11/">Lumberyard Blog</a> and the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lumberyard/latest/releasenotes/lumberyard-relnotes-intro.html">Lumberyard Beta 1.11 release notes</a>.

<p>Starting today, you can further improve security for your web applications on Amazon CloudFront by selecting a pre-defined security policy that enforces TLS version 1.1 or 1.2 as the minimum protocol version. Amazon CloudFront will automatically select the cipher suite for your selected security policy which it will use to encrypt your content before returning it to viewers over HTTPS. For instance, with this feature, you can select the security policy that enforces TLS version 1.1 and weak ciphers such as RC4 and 3DES will automatically be excluded. This feature is available when you use custom SSL certificates to serve HTTPS requests using SNI.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>All existing CloudFront distributions that are configured to use custom SSL certificates and to serve HTTPS requests using SNI will default to use TLS version 1.0 and all supported ciphers except RC4. You can choose to change the security policy for these distributions via the CloudFront console or API. Note that this feature applies to the SSL handshake for viewer connections to CloudFront. Customers already had the ability to specify minimum TLS version 1.1 or 1.2 for the handshake between CloudFront and their custom origins.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>There is no additional fee for this feature. For more information about the security policies, that enforce the minimum TLS versions and their associated cipher suite, please see the CloudFront <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValues-security-policy" target="_blank">documentation</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Sep 22, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) now allows you to add or drop Linux capabilities to containers through the use of Docker’s cap-add and cap-drop flags. Linux capabilities give fine grained access control to processes without granting them root access to a system.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Docker containers run as “unprivileged” by default and thus are unable to execute most system and network administration operations. Docker privileged mode gives containers root access, which may not be optimal or secure for many workloads. With cap-add and cap-drop, you can specify the capabilities to add or drop for each container in a task definition. This gives you fine-grained controls to run containerized applications that require additional permissions without adding unnecessary security risks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can now use additional built-in slot types for phone numbers, speed and weight with your <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lex/">Amazon Lex</a> chatbot.</p> 
<p>Slot types convert user utterances into data types, such as numbers and dates. With built-in slot types, you can quickly and easily define slots of a particular slot type in your chatbot to accurately resolve user responses to slot values. The <b>phone number</b> slot type will allow you to capture phone numbers specified in any of the commonly used formats in the US. The <b>speed</b> and <b>weight</b> enable resolution to the appropriate unit. Addition of these new slot types further expands the Amazon Lex built-in library bringing the total number of available built-in slot types to 96, and simplifying the process for your bot creation. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>These new built-in slot types are available in preview today in the U.S. East (N. Virginia) AWS Region. For more information please refer to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/howitworks-builtins-slots.html" target="_blank">the Amazon Lex documentation</a>.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Sep 21, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> introduced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/introducing-an-easier-way-to-delegate-permissions-to-aws-services-service-linked-roles/">service-linked roles</a>, which provide you an easy and secure way to delegate permissions to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html">many AWS services</a>. Today, AWS IAM added support for deletion of service-linked roles through the AWS IAM console and API/CLI. This will enable you to revoke permissions from an AWS service to create and manage AWS resources in your account.</p> 
<p> When you delete a service-linked role, AWS IAM validates that you do not have any resources in your account that are associated with that role. This prevents you from inadvertently revoking permissions required by an AWS service to manage your existing AWS resources, helping you maintain your resources in a stable state.</p> 
<p>AWS IAM is available in all regions. To learn more about how to delete service-linked roles, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/now-use-aws-iam-to-delete-a-service-linked-role-when-you-no-longer-require-an-aws-service-to-perform-actions-on-your-behalf/">Now Use AWS IAM to Delete a Service-Linked Role When You No Longer Require an AWS Service to Perform Actions on Your Behalf</a>.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Sep 21, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>AWS CloudTrail now allows you to automatically add your new and existing Amazon S3 buckets to S3 Data Events. <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-and-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html#logging-data-events" target="_blank">S3 Data Events</a> allow you to record API actions on Amazon S3 objects and receive detailed information such as the AWS account, IAM user role, and IP address of the caller, time of the API call, and other details. Previously, you had to manually add individual S3 buckets in your account to track S3 object-level operations, and repeat the process for each new S3 bucket. Now, you can automatically log S3 Data Events for all of your new and existing S3 buckets with a few clicks. This ensures that all S3 object-level API activity in your account is recorded to help with your data exfiltration and S3 objects usage analysis.</p> 
<p>The ability to automatically add S3 Data Events for all Amazon S3 buckets is available in US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (N.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Sep 21, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>We are pleased to announce that Network Load Balancers can now distribute traffic to AWS resources using their IP addresses as targets in addition to the instance IDs. You can now also load balance to resources in on-premises locations reachable over <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/">AWS Direct Connect</a> and resources in EC2-Classic. Load balancing across AWS and on-premises resources using the same load balancer makes it easy for you to migrate-to-cloud, burst-to-cloud, or failover-to-cloud.</p> 
<p>Prior to this launch, when using an instance ID as a target, an EC2 instance could only receive traffic from the load balancer on its primary IP address and primary network interface. This limits hosting multiple applications on the same instance where each application requires different IP address, network interface, or security group. Using IP addresses as targets removes this limitation as the load balancer can route to multiple IP addresses and network interfaces on the same instance. Load balancing using IP addresses also provides flexibility with microservice based architectures, where each application target can now use a known port instead of a random port simplifying inter-application communication. This feature also enables load balancing to your on-premises resources thereby supporting hybrid architectures.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Load balancing using IP addresses is available today for existing and new Network Load Balancers in all public AWS regions except the China (Beijing) region. You can get started using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or AWS SDK.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To learn more, please visit the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-target-groups.html#target-type" target="_blank">Target Groups</a> section and the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/target-group-register-targets.html" target="_blank">Register Targets</a> section from the Network Load Balancer User Guide.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Sep 18, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon EC2 Spot now allows Amazon EBS-backed instances to be stopped in the event of interruption, instead of being terminated when capacity is no longer available at your preferred price. Spot can then fulfill your request by restarting instances from a stopped state when capacity is available within your price and time requirements. To use this new feature, choose “stop” instead of “terminate” as the interruption behavior when submitting a persistent Spot request. When you choose “stop”, Spot will shut down your instance upon interruption. The EBS root device and attached EBS volumes are saved, and their data persists. When capacity is available again within your price and time requirements, Spot will restart your instance. Upon restart, the EBS root device is restored from its prior state, previously attached data volumes are reattached, and the instance retains its instance ID. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>This feature is available for persistent Spot requests and Spot Fleets with the “maintain” fleet option enabled. You will not be charged for instance usage while your instance is stopped. EBS volume storage is charged at standard rates. You can cancel your bid at any time to terminate stopped instances. This feature is only available for instances with an Amazon EBS volume as their root device.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Sep 18, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Delivering quality mobile applications is a key issue for mobile developers as mobile application users are becoming more demanding and their attention is increasingly divided.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In order to deliver higher quality applications, developers need additional flexibility to specify and access custom generated files on the devices/hosts.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With the introduction of Custom Artifacts, developers can now generate their own test artifacts, for example custom reports, log files, or images. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/">AWS Device Farm</a> will now gather these custom artifacts from a location specified by the developer. Developers can now seamlessly integrate their test artifacts with AWS Device Farm. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>AWS Device Farm is available from all regions and based out of the US West (Oregon) region.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Sep 18, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Run Command now supports additional access control with tag-based permissions and multi-tag targeting.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, you could only restrict Run Command access based on instance IDs, which required manual permission updates as your environment scaled up or down. Now, you can control Run Command access based on instance tags using your existing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies. For example, you can tag instances based on business units and only allow access to those instances to members of that business unit. When new instances are launched with tags, the corresponding IAM permissions are automatically applied.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In addition, you can now target instances using multiple tags. Previously, you could only target instances with Run Command using one tag and one value, but many instances are identified by multiple tags. For example, now you can send a command to instances tagged as production and webservers, to instances in a test or development environment and tagged as databases, or to any combination. Multi-tag targeting is available through AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), SDKs, and APIs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With this launch, you can increase your access control to instances based on tags. You can control the users who can access an instance and the actions that they can perform on that instance. Combined with the control you have through Systems Manager Document permissions, you can create more flexible instance access. In addition, you can still keep an audit of trail of who performed actions and when they were performed.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Systems Manager is available in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">all commercial regions and GovCloud</a>.<br /> <br /> For more information about Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Run Command, visit our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/systems-manager/run-command/" target="_blank">Product Page</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-rc-setting-up-cmdsec.html" target="_blank">Documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/">AWS Identity and Access Management</a> (IAM) policy summaries make it easier to view and understand the permissions in your policies when using the IAM console. Today, we updated policy summaries to help you identify and correct errors in your IAM policies. When you set permissions using policies, for each action you specify, you must match that action to supported resources or conditions. Now, you will see a warning if these policy elements (actions, resources, and conditions) defined in an IAM policy do not match. With this update, policy summaries make it easy to detect if a policy includes an action that does not support the resource or condition specified.</p>

<p>This new Quick Start automatically deploys a secure, performant, and fault-tolerant StorReduce cluster on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud, into a configuration of your choice.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>StorReduce is a specialized cloud deduplication solution for companies that use object storage like Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for large volumes of data. StorReduce sits between your applications and the object store, transparently performing inline data deduplication at ratios equaling those of industry-best purpose-built appliances while exposing the Amazon S3 API. Storage and bandwidth requirements are reduced by as much as 30 times, and data transfer times and backup windows can be reduced by the same amount.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The AWS Cloud provides a suite of infrastructure services that enable you to deploy StorReduce in a highly available, fault-tolerant, and affordable way. With StorReduce on AWS, you can use StorReduce features such as deduplication, copy-on-write (COW) cloning of data, inter-regional/inter-cloud deduplicated replication, and much more with ease. You can deploy StorReduce within a new or existing VPC across multiple Availability Zones, with traffic distributed evenly across StorReduce’s endpoints through a load balancer. The deployment takes about 20 minutes for a cluster of three StorReduce servers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The deployment and configuration tasks are automated by AWS CloudFormation templates that you can customize during launch. You can also use the templates as a starting point for your own implementation, by downloading them from the <a href="https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-storreduce" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. The Quick Start includes a guide with step-by-step deployment and configuration instructions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This Quick Start automates the deployment of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, a platform as a service (PaaS) solution, on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. OpenShift Container Platform uses Docker containers, Google Kubernetes orchestration, and the container-optimized Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system to help developers and IT create and deploy their apps.</p> 
<p>The Quick Start includes AWS CloudFormation templates that build the AWS infrastructure by following AWS best practices, and then pass that environment to Ansible playbooks to build out the OpenShift environment. The AWS CloudFormation templates use AWS Lambda to generate a dynamic SSH key pair that is loaded into an Auto Scaling group. The Ansible inventory file is auto-generated accordingly. The combination of AWS CloudFormation and Ansible enables you to deploy and tear down your OpenShift environment by using CloudFormation stacks. The deployment includes OpenShift master nodes, etcd nodes, and nodes that provide the runtime environment for containers.<br /> </p> 
<p> The Quick Start includes a deployment guide, which describes the reference architecture and provides step-by-step instructions for deploying Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on AWS.</p> 
<p>You can also use the AWS CloudFormation template as a starting point for your own implementation, by downloading it from the <a href="https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-redhat-openshift">Quick Start GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p> This new Quick Start automatically deploys a highly available IBM Spectrum Scale cluster with replication on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud, into a configuration of your choice. (A small cluster can be deployed in about 25 minutes.)</p> 
<p> IBM Spectrum Scale is a flexible, software-defined storage solution that can be deployed as highly available, high-performance file storage. It can scale in several dimensions, including performance (bandwidth and IOPS), capacity, and number of nodes that can mount the file system. The product’s high performance and scalability helps address the needs of applications whose performance (or performance-to-capacity ratio) demands cannot be met by traditional scale-up storage systems. The IBM Spectrum Scale software is being made available through a 90-day trial license evaluation program.</p> 
<p> This Quick Start automates the deployment of IBM Spectrum Scale on AWS for users who require highly available access to a shared name space across multiple instances with good performance, without requiring an in-depth knowledge of IBM Spectrum Scale. </p> 
<p> The Quick Start deploys IBM Network Shared Disk (NSD) storage server instances and IBM Spectrum Scale compute instances into a virtual private cloud (VPC) in your AWS account. Data and metadata elements are replicated across two Availability Zones for optimal data protection. You can build a new VPC for IBM Spectrum Scale, or deploy the software into your existing VPC. The automated deployment provisions the IBM Spectrum Scale instances in Auto Scaling groups for instance scaling and management. </p> 
<p> The deployment and configuration tasks are automated by AWS CloudFormation templates that you can customize during launch. You can also use the templates as a starting point for your own implementation, by downloading them from the <a href="https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-ibm-spectrum-scale">GitHub repository</a>. The Quick Start includes a guide with step-by-step deployment and configuration instructions. </p>

<p> You can now create and manage <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html">lifecycle hooks</a> for Auto Scaling Groups using the AWS management console. Previously, this functionality was only available through the AWS <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/APIReference/API_PutLifecycleHook.html">Application Programming Interface (API)</a>, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html#adding-lifecycle-hooks">Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>, and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-as-lifecyclehook.html">AWS CloudFormation</a>. In addition, creating lifecycle hooks is now more convenient as it can be done in the same step as creating your Auto Scaling Group using the ‘CreateAutoScalingGroup’ call through the AWS <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAutoScalingGroup.html">API</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/autoscaling/create-auto-scaling-group.html">CLI</a>.</p> 
<p> Lifecycle hooks allow you to control what happens when your Amazon EC2 instances are launched and terminated as you scale out and in. For example, you might download and install software when an instance is launching, and archive instance log files in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) when an instance is terminating.</p> 
<p> There is no charge for using Auto Scaling; you pay only for the underlying instances provisioned. To learn more about lifecycle hooks, visit the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html">Auto Scaling documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Amazon Pinpoint now supports two-way text messaging which enables Amazon Pinpoint customers to receive text messages from their users. When a user replies back to a text message, Amazon Pinpoint will pass that text message to the customer who can programmatically respond back to that text message. <br /> </p> 
<p>The two-way text messaging capabilities enables many new use cases for Amazon Pinpoint customers, particularly for multi-step transactional workflows that require than an action be taken in response to the receipt of a text message from a user to an initial outbound message. For example, a customer could use Amazon Pinpoint to alert a user to an event such as a subscription refill and ask the user if they would like to initiate the refill by responding to the initial message with a reply of yes or no. When the return text message is received, the Amazon Pinpoint customer can then programmatically process the responses and determine the next action to take, such as submitting an order to a pharmacy to refill the prescription.<br /> </p> 
<p>Two-way text messaging is available on Amazon Pinpoint from US East (N. Virginia). <br /> </p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glue/">AWS Glue</a> is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy for customers to prepare and load their data for analytics. AWS Glue is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to set up or manage. With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, customers can create and run an ETL job. You simply point AWS Glue to your data stored on AWS, and AWS Glue discovers your data and stores associated metadata (e.g. table definition and schema) in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. Once cataloged, your data is immediately searchable, queryable, and available for ETL. With AWS Glue, data can be available for analytics in minutes.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>AWS Glue is now available to customers in the US West (Oregon) and US East (Ohio) regions, as well as the US East (N. Virginia) region, and will expand to additional regions in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Sep 7, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) now supports the Network Load Balancer for load balancing TCP traffic to container tasks and services.<br /> </p> 
<p>The Network Load Balancer offers a high-performance load balancing option that operates at the network connection (TCP) layer and allows you to route connections to containers running on Amazon ECS based on IP protocol data. Network Load Balancer is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies. Network Load Balancer is optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns while using a single static or dynamic IP address per Availability Zone.<br /> </p> 
<p>Previously, traffic routed through the Classic Load Balancer or Application Load Balancer was intercepted and then forwarded onto target Amazon ECS tasks or services. This meant that you could not pass source IP data to your containerized applications without configuring Proxy Protocol, or establish high-throughput direct TCP connections to your containers while taking advantage of a load balancer.<br /> </p> 
<p>Now, you can use the Network Load Balancer to form direct TCP connections from clients to your Amazon ECS tasks and services. This allows for services that use TCP connections on static or dynamic ports to use the load balancer. Additionally, customers that do not want to terminate or offload their secure connections at the load balancer can route and pass-through traffic directly to containers, and see the original source IP information automatically in the logs of the Amazon ECS task or service.<br /> </p> 
<p>Read more about the integration between Amazon ECS and the Network Load Balancer in the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create-network-load-balancer.html" target="_blank">Amazon ECS Documentation</a>. Please visit our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">product page</a> for more information about Amazon EC2 Container Service.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon EC2 Container Service is available in US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), EU (Frankfurt), EU (Ireland), EU (London), China (Beijing).

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Sep 7, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>You can now use the new dynamic range compression (DRC) tag to enhance the volume of certain sounds in your audio file. The sounds in an audio file range from softer sounds to louder, depending on the text, the language, and the voice. For example, conflicting ambient sounds such as those of a moving vehicle can often mask the softer sounds, making the audio track difficult to hear clearly. To enhance the clarity of the Text-to-Speech output, simply use the SSML tag “DRC” to mark the text input. This is especially suitable for audio to be used in noisy environments. DRC is a boolean parameter (meaning that it's either on or off) that can be used with any Amazon Polly supported voice or language. It can be used for an entire section of text, or only for a few words, based on your needs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Visit the Amazon Polly <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/supported-ssml.html" target="_blank">documentation on SSML tags</a> for more information on the DRC tag, and try the new feature through the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/polly/home" target="_blank">Amazon Polly console</a>, today!&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Sep 7, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>If you are using Amazon Route 53 as your public, authoritative DNS, you will now have the capability to easily log DNS queries received by Amazon Route 53 through integration with CloudWatch Logs. This capability makes it easier to debug issues, conduct security audits, and run business analytics. With near real-time log delivery, customers can react quickly to events, and the power of CloudWatch Logs makes it easy to search, export, or archive your query logs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p> Public DNS query logs can be a useful tool to troubleshoot issues with your application. They can also be an essential part of security audits by enabling you to understand what domain names your end users are querying for, which can also be a useful business metric. Once you have enabled DNS Query logs for Route 53, the Cloudwatch Log records can be exported to S3 or streamed to Kinesis Firehose and Amazon Elasticsearch. </p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Sep 7, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>This new Quick Start automatically deploys HTTPS endpoints and AWS Lambda functions for implementing webhooks, to enable event-driven integration between Git services and Amazon Web Services (AWS) services on the AWS Cloud.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Quick Start implements the endpoints and required code to trigger a Lambda function that zips up the code in your Git repository and places it in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). It implements two endpoints: one uses the Git provider’s HTTP API to download a zipped copy of the current Git repository, and the other uses SSH to pull from the Git repository. You can choose either endpoint depending on your use case, repository size, and any other requirements. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>After you deploy the Quick Start, you can set up a webhook that uses the endpoints to create a bridge between your Git repository and AWS services like AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild that use Amazon S3 as a source. With this setup, builds and pipeline executions occur automatically when you commit your code to a Git repository, and your code can be continuously integrated, tested, built, and deployed on the AWS Cloud with each change.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The deployment includes API Gateway, to accept webhook requests from Git, Lambda functions to connect to the Git service, an AWS KMS key to encrypt the SSK private key for connections, and S3 buckets for the zipped contents of your Git repository and the AWS KMS-encrypted private keys. The Quick Start doesn’t create or configure webhooks, because the process varies depending on the Git software you are using. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>The deployment is automated by an AWS CloudFormation template that you can customize during launch. You can also use the template as a starting point for your own implementation, by downloading it from the <a href="https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-git2s3" target="_blank">Quick Start GitHub repository</a>. The Quick Start includes a guide with step-by-step deployment and configuration instructions. &nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Sep 5, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Since we made Amazon EC2 F1 instances generally available earlier this year, we have seen exciting adoption by customers, partners and the developer and research community. Customers are using F1 for accelerating a diverse set of applications such as genomic processing, data analytics, security, image and video processing and machine learning. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/f1/partners/">F1 Partners</a> and developers are taking advantage of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?x=0&amp;y=0&amp;searchTerms=FPGA" target="_blank">AWS Marketplace</a> to make their innovations available to the broader community of AWS customers.</p> 
<p>Today we are excited to announce the preview of a development workflow that allows customers to use OpenCL with Amazon EC2 F1 FPGA Instances to accelerate their C/C++ applications. Software developers with little to no FPGA experience, will find a familiar development experience and now can use the cloud-scale availability of FPGAs to supercharge their applications. To sign-up for the preview, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga/blob/master/sdk/SDAccel/README.md" target="_blank">preview page</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We are also making F1 instances available in our US West (Oregon) and EU (Ireland) regions. To get started using F1 instances in these new regions, you can use the&nbsp;AWS Management Console,&nbsp;AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or&nbsp;AWS SDKs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Based on customer feedback, we have also added new features and improvements into F1 HDK Release 1.3.1, AWS FPGA Shell, FPGA Developer AMI and the SDK.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Amazon FPGA Shell now provides dramatically better utilization of the Custom Logic (CL) area available to the developers. Simply put, this means that developers can now achieve higher FPGA area utilization, enabling larger or faster acceleration logic. We added FPGA-initiated read/write over PCI to the host CPU allowing FPGA logic to initiate data transfers to/from the host CPU applications. We also improved the UltraRAM utilization, enabling the CL to utilize all of the FPGA URAM blocks, useful for designs that need low latency memory access. We have expanded the DMA support, allowing DMA transactions of any size. We have also added support for multi-queue in each direction.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Sep 1, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>If you're using Route 53 traffic flow, you can now use geoproximity routing, which lets you route traffic based on the physical distance between your users and your resources. You can also route more or less traffic to each resource by specifying a positive or negative bias.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When you create a traffic flow policy, you can specify either an AWS region (if you're using AWS resources) or the latitude and longitude for each endpoint. For example, suppose you have EC2 instances in the AWS US East (Ohio) region and in the US West (Oregon) region. When a user in Los Angeles browses to your website, geoproximity routing will route the DNS query to the EC2 instances in the US West (Oregon) region because it's closer geographically. If you want a larger portion of users in the middle of the United States to be routed to one region, you can specify a positive bias for that region, a negative bias for the other region, or both.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To use geoproximity routing, create traffic flow rules that have a routing policy of Geoproximity. You can set up this feature using the&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy.html#routing-policy-geoproximity">traffic flow console</a> or the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/api-policies-traffic-policy-document-format.html#traffic-policy-document-format-rules-geoproximity" target="_blank">Route 53 API</a>.</p>
