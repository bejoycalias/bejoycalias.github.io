<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 31, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Nearly nine years ago, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced the launch of Amazon CloudFront, its global Content Delivery Network (CDN). What started as a novel, high-performing edge network with 14 Points of Presence has now grown to support millions of viewers around the world. Today, we are excited to announce our 100th Point of Presence (89 Edge Locations and 11 Regional Edge Caches) in one of Amazon CloudFront’s fastest growing geographies, Japan. Our 100th Point of Presence (POP) is also the fifth Edge Location in Tokyo, and our sixth in Japan.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon CloudFront’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/details/">100 Points of Presence</a>&nbsp;reach around the globe, with sites in 50 cities and 23 countries. In the past year, we have increased the size of our network by more than 50 percent, adding 37 locations. Included among these additions are nine new cities and four new countries*: Berlin, Germany; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Prague, Czech Republic*; Boston, Massachusetts; Munich, Germany; Vienna, Austria*; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia*; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Zurich, Switzerland*.</p> 
<p>During 2016’s re:Invent conference, we <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/11/announcing-regional-edge-caches-for-amazon-cloudfront/">announced</a> a new type of caching layer called Regional Edge Caches, which added 11 Points of Presence to our network. These locations have a larger cache-width than our classic Edge Locations and sit between our Edge Locations and the customer’s origin server. This allows us to cache the customer’s content longer and closer to their viewers thus reducing the load on the customer’s origin and making origin fetches faster.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We are honored to work with customers of all sizes around the world. From the individual blogger or small business owner, to the world’s largest corporations, we value each of you and thank you for being a part of our global network!&nbsp;</p>

<b id="AWS_Storage_Gateway_is_now_HIPAA_eligible"> <a name="AWS_Storage_Gateway_is_now_HIPAA_eligible"> AWS Storage Gateway is now HIPAA eligible</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 31, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>AWS Storage Gateway is now HIPAA eligible. If you have an executed <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/getting-started/#BAA_Agreements">Business Associate Agreement (BAA)</a> with AWS, you can now use Storage Gateway to store, backup and archive protected health information (PHI) on scalable, cost-effective, and secure AWS storage services, including Amazon S3, Amazon Glacier and Amazon EBS, which are also HIPAA eligible.</p> 
<p>Information on HIPAA eligible services on AWS can be found at our&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-compliance/">HIPAA Compliance page</a>, and you can enter into a BAA with AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/getting-started/#BAA_Agreements">here</a>. HIPAA eligibility for Storage Gateway applies to all gateway types (File, Volume and Tape), and all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS Regions</a> where Storage Gateway is available. For more information, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/GettingStarted.html" target="_blank">Getting Started documentation</a> for Storage Gateway, or <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/create/gateway" target="_blank">try it out now</a>!</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 30, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>We are excited to announce that CloudWatch added support for Extended metrics retention, Percentile statistics on metrics, and High-Resolution Custom Metrics and Alarms in the AWS GovCloud (US) region.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With this launch, CloudWatch Metrics now supports the following three retention schedules:</p> 
<li>1 minute datapoints are available for 15 days</li> 
<li>5 minute datapoints are available for 63 days<br /> </li> 
<li>1 hour datapoints are available for 455 days<br /> </li> 
<p>In addition, CloudWatch added support for percentile statistics on Metrics. You can now visualize metrics and alarm on p90, p95, p99, p99.9 or any other percentile statistics. Percentiles are particularly useful when applied to metrics that exhibit large variances. They also help you understand the distribution of a metric, and can be critical to understand outliers or unusual metric behaviors.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>CloudWatch also lets you to monitor your custom applications and infrastructure in near real-time, down to per-second resolution. Using the existing PutMetricData API, you can publish Custom Metrics down to 1-second resolution. This gives you more immediate visibility and greater granularity into the state and performance of your custom applications, such as observing short-lived spikes and functions. In addition, you can also alert sooner with High-Resolution Alarms, as frequently as 10-second periods. Additionally, if you use collectd to gather your metrics, you can publish these metrics to CloudWatch using our updated collectd plugin supporting high-resolution periods down to 1-second. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Start exploring these new features using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), and AWS SDKs. To learn more, please visit <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html" target="_blank">CloudWatch documentation</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/">CloudWatch pricing page</a>.</p> 
<p>Extended metrics retention, Percentile statistics, and High-Resolution Custom Metrics and Alarms are available in AWS GovCloud (US) region and all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS Public Regions</a>.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 27, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon WorkSpaces now supports multi-factor authentication when users access their WorkSpaces from PCoIP Zero Clients running the PCOIP firmware version 6.0.0 (or newer). This allows administrators to require an additional factor of authentication when users are accessing their WorkSpaces from a PCoIP Zero Client device. This update also removes the need to use the PCoIP Connection Manager to connect to WorkSpaces, making it easier for you to use PCoIP Zero Clients in your organization. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>For more information, please refer to the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/userguide/amazon-workspaces-pcoip-zero-client.html">Amazon WorkSpaces PCoIP Zero Client</a>&nbsp;documentation. This feature is available at no additional charge, in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">all AWS regions</a>&nbsp;where Amazon WorkSpaces is available. First time WorkSpaces customers can try the service by taking advantage of the Amazon WorkSpaces Free Tier offering for two calendar months at no cost.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 26, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>AWS Batch now supports user tags that will automatically propagate to Spot instances launched by your Managed Compute Environments. This makes it easier for AWS Batch customers to track ownership, drive their cost accounting processes, implement compliance protocols, and to control access to Spot instances via IAM policies.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, if you wanted to tag Spot instances launched by AWS Batch you had to write and manage custom code. Now you can provide user tags when you create a Managed Compute Environment and let AWS Batch automatically tag instances launched on your behalf. </p> 
<p>Tags enable you to categorize your AWS resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. This is useful when you have many resources of the same type — you can quickly identify a specific resource based on the tags you've assigned to it. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's Amazon EC2 instances that helps you track each instance's owner and stack level. </p> 
<p>Tagging is supported today in all regions where AWS Batch is available. For more information, click <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_ComputeResource.html#Batch-Type-ComputeResource-tags">here</a>.</p>

<p> Amazon EC2 Systems Manager now supports the ability to run any script or Systems Manager Document stored on GitHub or Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).</p> 
<p> Previously, in order to run scripts and Documents in Systems Manager, you needed to create and store JSON files directly in Systems Manager as Documents.&nbsp;Now you can reference and run external files from your own public or private GitHub repositories or Amazon S3 buckets. This can be done directly by using one of two pre-written Documents, or you can use the underlying plugins to download content and run scripts or Documents from GitHub or Amazon S3. You do not need to modify the script, you can keep it written in any language supported by the instance. For example, it can be written in Python, Ruby, or YAML. Additionally, you can use unmodified PowerShell scripts or Ansible playbooks.</p> 
<p> You can also reference a document within another Systems Manager Document. This enables you to maintain dedicated and smaller modular scripts, supporting reusability, instead of manually copying all scripts into one document. For example, you can maintain two Documents with dedicated scripts and call them in a third Document when needed.</p>

<b id="Introducing_Amazon_EC2_P3_Instances"> <a name="Introducing_Amazon_EC2_P3_Instances"> Introducing Amazon EC2 P3 Instances</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 25, 2017</span> </p> 
<p> We are excited to announce the availability of Amazon EC2 P3 instances, the next-generation of EC2 compute-optimized GPU instances. P3 instances are powered by up to 8 of the latest-generation NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs and are ideal for computationally advanced workloads such as machine learning (ML), high performance computing (HPC), data compression, and cryptography. They are also ideal for specific industry applications for scientific computing and simulations, financial analytics, and image and video processing.<br /> </p> 
<p>P3 instances provide a powerful platform for ML and HPC by also leveraging 64 vCPUs using the custom Intel Xeon E5 processors, 488 GB of RAM, and up to 25 Gbps of aggregate network bandwidth leveraging Elastic Network Adapter technology.<br /> </p> 
<p>Based on NVIDIA’s latest Volta architecture, each Tesla V100 GPUs provide 125 TFLOPS of mixed-precision performance, 15.7 TFLOPS of single precision (FP32) performance and 7.8 TFLOPS of double precision (FP64) performance. This is possible because each Tesla V100 GPUs contains 5,120 CUDA Cores and 640 Tensor Cores. A 300 GB/s NVLink hyper-mesh interconnect allows GPU-to-GPU communication at high speed and low latency.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For ML applications, P3 instances offer up to 14x performance improvement over P2 instances, allowing developers to train their machine learning models in hours instead of days, and bring their innovations to market faster. &nbsp;</p>

<b id="Amazon_ElastiCache_for_Redis_now_supports_In-Transit_and_At-Rest_Encryption_to_Help_Protect_Sensitive_Information"> <a name="Amazon_ElastiCache_for_Redis_now_supports_In-Transit_and_At-Rest_Encryption_to_Help_Protect_Sensitive_Information"> Amazon ElastiCache for Redis now supports In-Transit and At-Rest Encryption to Help Protect Sensitive Information</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 25, 2017</span> </p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis">Amazon ElastiCache for Redis</a> now supports encryption in-transit and at-rest for secure internode communications to help keep personally identifiable information (PII) safe. The new encryption in-transit feature enables you to encrypt all communications between clients and Redis server as well as between the Redis servers (primary and read replica nodes). The encryption at-rest feature allows you to encrypt your backups on disk and in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>. Additionally, you can use the Redis AUTH command for an added level of authentication.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Below are the key highlights of these new features and how each of these translates into real benefits for you:</p> 
<li>Ease of Setup: Open-source Redis does not support native encryption, and you have to build self-managed solutions using an SSL proxy which requires extra efforts. With these features, you now have a fully managed experience for all your data encryption needs. You can start using the new features by enabling it at the time of cluster creation via the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/">ElastiCache console</a> or through the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/APIReference/API_CreateReplicationGroup.html">API</a>. As long as the Redis clients support TLS protocol, you don’t have to modify your applications other than making a small configuration change to your Redis clients. The change to your Redis client is simple, for example, with a Jedis java client, while creating a Redis connection, you need to pass isTls=true flag.</li> 
<li>Complete Security Certificate Management: You don’t have to manage the lifecycle of your certificates because ElastiCache for Redis automatically manages the issuance, renewal, and expiration of your certificates. Key highlights include</li> 
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">I. Managed certificate issuance – ElastiCache for Redis takes care of certificate issuance process transparently to your application. You do not need to acquire a certificate from a certificate authority and deploy/upload the certificate once acquired. ElastiCache for Redis uses a trusted Certificate Authority behind the scenes, minimizing any client set up or costs associated with a third-party certificate authority.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">II. Managed certificate renewal – ElastiCache for Redis automatically manages the certificate renewal and deployment process for Amazon-issued TLS certificates eliminating manual errors. ElastiCache for Redis minimizes downtime due to misconfigured, revoked, or expired certificates.</p> 
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">III. Secure Key Management – ElastiCache for Redis is designed to protect and manage the private keys used with certificates. Strong encryption and key management best practices are used when protecting and storing private keys.</p> 
<li>Open-source S2N library for enhanced security – ElastiCache for Redis uses TLS 1.2 protocol and relies on <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/s2n" target="_blank">Amazon S2N</a> library to provide strong encryption. S2N is an open source implementation of the TLS protocol that is lightweight and fast while providing strong encryption. The S2N library uses advanced safety mechanisms like static analysis, penetration testing and built-in memory protection providing better security protections.</li> 
<p>There is no additional charge to use these features, and they are available in the US West (Oregon), US West (N. California), US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), Canada (Central), EU (Ireland), and South America (S&atilde;o Paulo) Regions. We will continue to make these features available in other AWS Regions.</p>

<b id="Amazon_Pinpoint_Adds_Several_Push_Notification_Enhancements"> <a name="Amazon_Pinpoint_Adds_Several_Push_Notification_Enhancements"> Amazon Pinpoint Adds Several Push Notification Enhancements</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 25, 2017</span> </p> 
<p> Amazon Pinpoint now supports the Apple PushKit framework, and includes expanded support for collapse keys, message priority, and Time to Live (TTL) for Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and Apple Push Notification Service (APNs). </p> 
<p> Integrating the PushKit framework into your application provides several advantages over traditional push notifications. For example, if your app is not running when a user receives a notification, the operating system can pre-load certain background processes. This capability results in shorter load times and higher performance when the user clicks the notification.</p> 
<p> Collapse keys help you avoid overwhelming your users with redundant notifications. For example, you can make less important messages collapsible. If you send a related message in the future, the older message will be replaced with the newer one.</p> 
<p> Message priority support lets you specify the importance of each notification you send. High priority notifications are delivered immediately. Depending on the recipient's operating system, high priority messages may cause the user's device to wake from sleep. Normal priority messages may not be delivered immediately, but have less impact on the battery life of recipients' devices.</p> 
<p> Time to live (TTL) support allows you to specify the length of time your messages will be retained by the push notification service. If the notification service cannot deliver the notification within the specified time limit (for example, if the recipient's device is powered off), the message will be dropped.</p> 
<p> Customers can access these features using the Amazon Pinpoint API and SDKs. These features are available in the US East (N. Virginia) region.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 24, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>AWS Batch now emits CloudWatch Events as your jobs transition from one state to another. In the past, in order to obtain updates on the state of a running AWS Batch job, customers have had to rely on periodically polling the state of each job using the AWS CLI or an SDK. With the new AWS Batch event stream feature, it is now possible to retrieve near real-time, event-driven updates on the state of your AWS Batch jobs. Events are delivered through Amazon CloudWatch Events, and can be routed to any valid CloudWatch Events target, such as an AWS Lambda function or an Amazon SNS topic.</p> 
<p>This change is effective today in all AWS Regions supported by AWS Batch. The CloudWatch Events web console will be updated soon, allowing you to create rules based on the AWS Batch event stream.</p> 
<p>AWS Batch is currently available in the following regions:</p> 
<li>US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1</li>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 20, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon QuickSight users can now add combo charts to their analyses and dashboards. Combo charts are useful for visualizing data of different scales, such as product revenue ($) and units sold (#), in a single visualization. Data can be visualized as bars or lines, with two axes to display separate scales for each. Combo charts are available in both Standard and Enterprise Editions of Amazon QuickSight.<br /> </p> 
<p>This release also adds support for Row-Level Security (RLS) in Amazon QuickSight Enterprise Edition. RLS enables QuickSight dataset owners to control access to data at row granularity based on permissions associated with the user interacting with the data. With RLS, Amazon QuickSight users only need to manage a single set of data and apply appropriate row-level dataset rules to it. All associated dashboards and analyses will enforce these rules, simplifying dataset management and removing the need to maintain multiple datasets for users with different data access privileges.<br /> </p> 
<p>Combo charts and RLS are now available in all Amazon QuickSight Regions—US East (N. Virginia and Ohio), US West (Oregon), EU (Ireland), Asia Pacific (Singapore and Sydney).<br /> </p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 18, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>AWS Marketplace customers can now subscribe to and purchase software solutions from popular software vendors, which contain multiple Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) from the same vendor. In addition, software vendors may now create listings that combine multiple server roles or product offerings into new predefined solutions that are specifically designed to improve security, availability or performance. Customers can then browse these new solution listings and subscribe to them with a single click.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Many software vendors build products that require multiple server roles deployed in a single configuration, or offer multiple individual products that work together as integrated solutions. Support for multi-AMI solutions will now enable those vendors to list more sophisticated offerings in AWS Marketplace. Vendors such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/server/pp/prodview-2qb6yl6xq2one">Couchbase</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/server/pp/prodview-abb2lieaqfqs4">AccessData</a> have already created new solution listings that take advantage of this capability.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can now browse or search AWS Marketplace for solutions that are designed to work together and that can be purchased with a single subscription. A new website workflow will guide you through the process of procuring, configuring and launching each new solution, using one or more different fulfillment options that have been defined by the software vendor as AWS CloudFormation templates.</p> 
<p>Software vendors wishing to list new multi-AMI solutions on AWS Marketplace should visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/tour/">AWS Marketplace Seller Management Portal</a> to learn more.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 16, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Delivering high-quality applications is a critical priority for mobile application developers. As part of their development and quality assurance process, developers can work with emulators that come with their IDE and/or connect to a real device to their machines. However, it is impractical for developers to maintain a large set of local devices. Amazon Device Farm allows developers to test and debug their applications against a large set of real devices in the cloud.<br /> </p> 
<p>Now, with direct device access, mobile applications developers can&nbsp;use individual devices in their private test set as if they were directly connected to their local machine via USB. Developers can now test against a wide array of devices just like they would as if the devices were sitting on their desk.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This new functionality gives mobile application developers additional flexibility in their testing regimes to identify and address problems quickly without the expense of acquiring and maintaining a large set of local hardware. Developers can preview their work, debug, or automate test similar to how they work with device plugged into the machine directly. In the case of automated testing for CI/CD, this direct access capability provides developers flexibility in using the test framework of their choice.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To learn more about direct device access, please see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/direct-device-access.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<b id="AWS_WAF_Now_Supports_Geographic_Match"> <a name="AWS_WAF_Now_Supports_Geographic_Match"> AWS WAF Now Supports Geographic Match</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 16, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Today, we are excited to announced new Geographic (Geo) Match Conditions in AWS WAF. This new condition type allows you to use AWS WAF to restrict application access based on the geographic location of your viewers. With geo match conditions you can choose the countries from which AWS WAF should allow access.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Geo match conditions are important for many customers. For example, legal and licensing requirements restrict some customers from delivering their applications outside certain countries. These customers can now configure a whitelist that allows only viewers in those countries. Other customers need to prevent the downloading of their encrypted software by users in certain countries. These customers can configure a blacklist, so that end-users from those countries are blocked from downloading their software.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Geo match conditions can be combined with other AWS WAF rules to build sophisticated filtering policies. Customers who want to block certain geographies while still allowing certain developer IP addresses from those locations can now combine geo and IP match conditions to allow only authorized users. Other customers who want to prioritize users in their primary geography to optimize resource consumption can combine geo match conditions with AWS WAF rate-based Rules. These customers can set a higher rate limit for end users in preferred countries while setting a lower rate limit for others.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Getting started with geo match conditions is easy. Simply create a geo match condition using the AWS WAF API or AWS Management Console and add it to an existing or new AWS WAF rule. If AWS WAF receives a request from the specified countries, it will perform the action specified by the rule, such as counting the request or blocking access and responding with a 403 Forbidden HTTP response. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Geo match is available to AWS WAF customers at no additional charge. As with other AWS WAF features, you pay only for what you use and there are no upfront fees or minimum monthly commitments. You can learn more about geo match conditions by visiting the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/waf/">AWS WAF detail page</a> or by reading the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-geo-conditions.html" target="_blank">AWS WAF Developer Guide</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 16, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Today, we are excited to announce Regular Expression (regex) support in AWS WAF. Regex complements the string match conditions previously available in AWS WAF, allowing you to match more sophisticated request patterns when inspecting and filtering web requests.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For instance, you can now use regex to block certain known bad bots by looking for patterns like <i>B[a@]dB[o0]t </i>in the User-Agent header. You can also apply multiple regex patterns to a single request, allowing you, for example, to block requests that match <i>B[a@]dB[o0]t</i> or <i>C[r@]al[e0]rs[1-2]</i>*. Once created, regex patterns can be reused across multiple AWS WAF rules, allowing you to look for the same expression across different parts of a web request such as the Header, QueryString, or Body. Regex conditions can be combined with other condition types to create more sophisticated filters. For instance, you can use AWS WAF’s built-in SQL injection condition in conjunction with a regex-based condition to look for SQL injection attempts only on URLs with *<i>.php</i> while ignoring URLs with *<i>.jpg</i>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>AWS WAF supports most of the <a href="http://www.pcre.org/" target="_blank">standard Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE).</a> To get started, simply create a new string match condition with a regex pattern using the AWS WAF API or AWS Management Console and add that condition to a rule.</p> 
<p>Regex conditions are available to AWS WAF customers at no additional charge. As with other AWS WAF features, you pay only for what you use and there are no upfront fees or minimum monthly commitments. You can learn more about Regex Match Conditions by visiting the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/waf/">AWS WAF detail page</a> or by reading the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-regex-conditions.html" target="_blank">AWS WAF Developer Guide</a>.<br /> </p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 12, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Today Amazon Web Services and Microsoft announced a new deep learning library, called Gluon, which allows developers of all skill levels to prototype, build, train and deploy sophisticated machine learning models for the cloud, devices at the edge and mobile apps.<br /> </p> 
<p>With Gluon, developers can build machine learning models using a simple Python API and a range of pre-built, optimized neural network components. This makes it easier for developers to build neural networks using simple, concise code, without sacrificing training performance.</p> 
<p>Most deep learning frameworks require developers to define models and algorithms up-front using lengthy, complex code that is difficult to change. Other deep learning tools make model-building easier, but this simplicity can come at the cost of slower training performance.</p> 
<p>The Gluon interface gives developers the best of both worlds, offering the following benefits:</p> 
<p>1. <b>Simple, easy-to-understand code</b> – You get a full set of plug-and-play building blocks to build and train neural networks. These include predefined layers, optimizers, and initializers.</p> 
<p>2. <b>Flexible Structure</b> – Gluon brings together the neural network model and the training algorithm providing greater flexibility in the development process. This flexible structure makes your code intuitive and easy-to-debug, and opens the door for more advanced models.</p> 
<p>3. <b>Dynamic Graphs</b> – With Gluon, you can build on the fly, with any structure you want, and using any of Python’s native control flow.</p> 
<p>4. <b>High Performance</b> – You get all of these benefits without needing to sacrifice training speed.</p> 
<p>The Gluon interface currently works with the deep learning framework Apache MXNet and will support Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) in an upcoming release. AWS and Microsoft published Gluon’s reference specification so other deep learning engines can be integrated with the interface. To get started with the Gluon interface, visit: <a href="https://github.com/gluon-api/gluon-api/" target="_blank">https://github.com/gluon-api/gluon-api/</a>.</p>

<p>Today we’re announcing enhancements to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/reserved-instances/">Amazon RDS Reserved Instances (RIs)</a> that make them more flexible and easier to use, helping you get the most out of your RI discount. RIs give you the option to reserve a database instance for a one or three year term, and in turn receive a significant discount compared to on-demand instance pricing.</p> 
<p>Beginning with the October billing period, the discounted rate of all new and existing RDS RIs automatically applies to usage of any size in the DB instance family using the same database engine. The RI discounted rate also applies to usage of both Single-AZ and Multi-AZ configurations for the same database engine and DB instance family.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The discounted rate is automatically applied to usage, so it reduces the management overhead of trying to match RI discounts to running DB instances. Since you’re no longer tied to a specific DB instance size or Multi-AZ configuration, you can enjoy the discount even if your database needs change.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon RDS Reserved Instance size flexibility is offered in all regions for the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/">MySQL</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mariadb/">MariaDB</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/">PostgreSQL</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/">Amazon Aurora</a> database engines, as well as the “bring your own license” (BYOL) edition of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/oracle/">Oracle</a> database engine.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 11, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon EC2 Container Registry (Amazon ECR) now allows you to create rules to automate image cleanup across your Amazon ECR repositories.</p> 
<p>Development teams that use Amazon ECR actively often find that their repositories fill up with many container image versions. This makes it difficult to find the code changes that matter and incurs unnecessary storage costs. Previously, cleaning up your repository meant spending time to manually delete old images, or writing and executing scripts.</p> 
<p>Now, Amazon ECR Lifecycle Policies allow you to define a set of rules to automatically remove container images. You can also preview rules to see exactly which container images will be affected when the rule runs. This allows repositories to be better organized, makes it easier to find the code revisions that matter, and lowers storage costs.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/">AWS CodePipeline</a> can now execute pipelines in response to push-based triggers from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/">AWS CodeCommit</a>. Previously, CodePipeline checked CodeCommit periodically to see if there was a change. Now, CodeCommit will send an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">Amazon CloudWatch</a> Event when a change is committed to trigger a pipeline execution in CodePipeline. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Any CodeCommit-based pipeline created from the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/?nc2=h_m1" target="_blank">AWS Management Console</a> will use a CloudWatch Event to trigger a pipeline by default, and any edits to existing CodeCommit-based pipelines in the Management Console will migrate your pipelines to use CloudWatch Events. You can also choose not to use push support by changing the detection option in CodePipeline. If you are creating or updating a CodeCommit-based pipeline using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS Command Line Interface</a>, CodePipeline API, or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation</a>, you will need to take action if you want to take advantage of these new capabilities.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 10, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>We are pleased to announce support for multiple SSL certificates on Application Load Balancers using Server Name Indication (SNI). You can now host multiple secure (HTTPS) applications, each with its own SSL certificate, behind one load balancer. This greatly simplifies application management as many secure applications or multi-tenant SaaS applications can run behind the same load balancer.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Prior to this launch, Application Load Balancers supported only one certificate for a standard HTTPS listener (port 443) and you had to use Wildcard or Multi-Domain (SAN) certificates to host multiple secure applications behind the same load balancer. The potential security risks with Wildcard certificates and the operational overhead of managing Multi-Domain certificates presented challenges. With SNI support you can associate multiple certificates with a listener and each secure application behind a load balancer can use its own certificate. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Application Load Balancers also support a smart certificate selection algorithm with SNI. If the hostname indicated by a client matches multiple certificates, the load balancer determines the best certificate to use based on multiple factors including the capabilities of the client. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>SNI is integrated with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/">AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html" target="_blank">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> for certificate management. You can associate up to 25 certificates with a load balancer in addition to a default certificate per listener.&nbsp;</p>

<p> AWS is pleased to release a major update to the Magento Quick Start reference deployment. This update adds support for Amazon Aurora as a relational database option, deployed using Amazon Relational Database System (Amazon RDS), in addition to Amazon RDS MySQL. The Quick Start also includes enhancements to the networking infrastructure through the deployment of Linux bastion hosts.</p> 
<p> Magento is an open-source content management system for e-commerce websites. The Quick Start automatically deploys and configures Magento Open Source (formerly Community Edition) 2.1.x in a highly available architecture on the AWS Cloud, using AWS services such as Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS), Amazon ElastiCache, and Amazon RDS. This automated deployment builds a cluster that runs Magento along with optional sample data.</p> 
<p>The AWS CloudFormation templates included in the Quick Start support two customizable deployment options: end-to-end deployment into a new virtual private cloud (VPC), and deployment into your existing AWS infrastructure. Deployment takes approximately 30-60 minutes, depending on whether you choose to include sample data. You can also use the templates as a starting point for your own implementation, by downloading them from the <a href="https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-magento">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>Amazon EC2 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/10/announcing-amazon-ec2-per-second-billing/">recently</a> transitioned from hourly to per-second billing. Previously, as your jobs completed, AWS Batch would retain idle compute resources for the majority of the billing hour in order to avoid the cost associated with additional instance launches within the hour. With per-second billing, AWS customers are able to focus on their applications instead of maximizing usage to the hour. As a result, AWS Batch will now evaluate compute resources more frequently and immediately scale down any idle instances when there are no more runnable jobs in your job queues.</p> 
<p>This change is effective today in the US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), EU (Ireland), EU (London), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), and Asia Pacific (Sydney) AWS Regions and will be effective in US East (N. Virginia) next week.</p> 
<p>AWS Batch is currently available in the following regions:</p> 
<li>US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1</li> 
<li>US East (Ohio) us-east-2</li> 
<li>US West (Oregon) us-west-2</li>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 4, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>This Quick Start provides the fundamentals for implementing identity and isolation in multi-tenant software as a service (SaaS) environments, using Amazon Cognito as the underlying identity provider.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Quick Start introduces core concepts and best practices that you can use in your own SaaS applications. It includes a lightweight SaaS order management system that illustrates different aspects of identity and isolation, spanning the system and tenant roles in a multi-tenant environment.</p> 
<p>The Quick Start uses claims to represent attributes that associate tenant information with each user. These claims are packaged and transported in an encoded JSON Web Token (JWT), and include a standard set of attributes that are supported by the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. In addition, the Quick Start supports custom attributes, which are conveyed as custom claims in the JWT returned by the authentication process. The custom attributes are provisioned and configured when each tenant is onboarded to the system.</p> 
<p>The Quick Start architecture includes AWS services such as the following:</p> 
<li>Amazon Cognito, for user and identity management</li> 
<li>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), to manage isolation policies and roles</li> 
<li>AWS Lambda, to implement a custom authorizer for validating system tokens</li> 
<li>Amazon API Gateway, to provide access to the microservices that support the reference application</li> 
<li>Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS), to host containers for running microservices</li> 
<li>Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), to serve content for the reference application</li> 
<li>Amazon DynamoDB, to provide storage for microservices</li> 
<p>The deployment and configuration tasks are automated by AWS CloudFormation templates that you can customize during launch. You can also use the templates as a starting point for your own implementation, by downloading them from the <a href="https://github.com/aws-quickstart/saas-identity-cognito">GitHub repository</a>. The Quick Start includes a guide that explains core SaaS identity and isolation concepts and implementation details, and includes step-by-step deployment and configuration instructions.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 2, 2017</span> </p> 
<p> We are excited to announce that Amazon EC2 usage of Linux based instances that are launched in On-Demand, Reserved and Spot form will be billed on one second increments, with a minimum of 60 seconds. </p> 
<p> Amazon EC2 Elastic GPUs and Amazon EBS volumes will also move from per hour billing to per second billing with a minimum of 60 seconds. As with EC2 instances, the list prices will continue to be displayed as it is today in GB-month for capacity, IOPS-month provisioned for io1 IOPS and per Million I/O requests for Magnetic IOPS.</p> 
<p> Today, customers may have use cases that require large number of instances running for irregular periods of time, such as dev/test, data processing, analytics, batch processing, image rendering and gaming applications. To improve flexibility and allow customers to focus on their application instead of maximizing usage to the hour, with EC2 per second billing, customers can start, stop, and terminate EC2 instances and take comfort in the fact that their EC2 resources will not be charged for the minutes and seconds remaining in the hours their instances were running.</p> 
<p> This change is effective in all AWS Regions and is effective immediately, for Linux instances that are newly launched or already running. Per-second billing is not currently applicable to instances running Microsoft Windows or Linux distributions that have a separate hourly charge. </p> 
<p> List prices and Spot Market prices are still listed on a per-hour basis, but bills are calculated down to the second. With Reserved Instances usage you can launch, use, and terminate multiple instances within an hour and get the Reserved Instance Benefit for all of the instances. Bills will now show times in decimal form instead of in minutes and seconds. </p> 
<p> Dedicated Instances, EBS Snapshots, and products in AWS Marketplace are still billed on an hourly basis. &nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 2, 2017</span> </p> 
<p> Today we are releasing enhancements to the AWS Lambda console that make it easier to create, configure, and test Lambda functions. You can now save up to ten test events for each Lambda function. You can access these saved test events from any machine or browser using the console. Previously, you were limited to only one saved test event per account, and you needed to use the same browser on the same machine in order to access the saved test event. </p> 
<p>The enhanced console also lets you create new functions more quickly. When creating a new function, you now only need to supply the function name and the execution role. The new console also groups relevant function settings together so that you can easily find the setting you want to configure. Read our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/improved-testing-on-the-aws-lambda-console/">blog</a> to learn more about the enhanced Lambda console.</p> 
<p>The enhanced Lambda console is now available in all regions where Lambda is available. This includes US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), South America (S&atilde;o Paulo), EU (Frankfurt), EU (Ireland), EU (London), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo).

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 2, 2017</span> </p> 
<p> Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) now allows customers to expand their VPCs by adding secondary IPv4 address ranges (CIDRs) to their VPCs. Customers can add the secondary CIDR blocks to the VPC directly from the console or by using the CLI after they have created the VPC with the primary CIDR block. Similar to the primary CIDR block, secondary CIDR blocks are also supported by all the AWS services including Elastic Load Balancing and NAT Gateway.</p> 
<p> This feature has two key benefits. First, customers, who are launching more and more resources in their VPCs, can now scale up their VPCs on-demand. Second, customers no longer have to over-allocate private IPv4 space to their VPCs - they can allocate only what is required at the time, and later expand it as needed. With these benefits, this feature can make it significantly easier for customers to manage their private IPv4 address space.</p> 
<p> There is no additional charge to use this feature. This feature is available in all AWS regions, including AWS China (Beijing) region operated by Sinnet and AWS GovCloud (US).</p>
