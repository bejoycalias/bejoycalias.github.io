<p><em>The recent addition of Xilinx FPGAs to AWS Cloud compute offerings is one way that AWS is enabling global growth in the areas of advanced analytics, deep learning and AI. The customized F1 servers use pooled accelerators, enabling interconnectivity of up to 8 FPGAs, each one including 64 GiB DDR4 ECC protected memory, with a dedicated PCIe x16 connection. That makes this a powerful engine with the capacity to process advanced analytical applications at scale, at a significantly faster rate. For example, AWS commercial partner <a href="http://www.edicogenome.com/dragen-on-amazon-web-services/">Edico Genome </a>is able to achieve an approximately 30X speedup in analyzing whole genome sequencing datasets using their DRAGEN platform powered with F1 instances.</em></p> 
<p><em>While the availability of FPGA F1 compute on-demand provides clear accessibility and cost advantages, many mainstream users are still finding that the “threshold to entry” in developing or running FPGA-accelerated simulations is too high. Researchers at the UC Berkeley RISE Lab have developed “FireSim”, powered by Amazon FPGA F1 instances as an open-source resource, FireSim lowers that entry bar and makes it easier for everyone to leverage the power of an FPGA-accelerated compute environment. Whether you are part of a small start-up development team or working at a large datacenter scale, hardware-software co-design enables faster time-to-deployment, lower costs, and more predictable performance. We are excited to feature FireSim in this post from Sagar Karandikar and his colleagues at UC-Berkeley.</em></p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">Mapping an 8-node FireSim cluster simulation to Amazon EC2 F1</p> 
<p style="text-align: left">As traditional hardware scaling nears its end, the data centers of tomorrow are trending towards heterogeneity, employing custom hardware accelerators and increasingly high-performance interconnects. Prototyping new hardware at scale has traditionally been either extremely expensive, or very slow. In this post, I introduce <a href="https://fires.im/">FireSim</a>, a new hardware simulation platform under development in the computer architecture research group at UC Berkeley that enables fast, scalable hardware simulation using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/f1/">Amazon EC2 F1 instances</a>.</p> 
<p>FireSim benefits both hardware and software developers working on new rack-scale systems: software developers can use the simulated nodes with new hardware features as they would use a real machine, while hardware developers have full control over the hardware being simulated and can run real software stacks while hardware is still under development. In conjunction with this post, we’re releasing the first public demo of FireSim, which lets you deploy your own 8-node simulated cluster on an F1 Instance and run benchmarks against it. This demo simulates a pre-built “vanilla” cluster, but demonstrates FireSim’s high performance and usability.</p> 
<h3>Why FireSim + F1?</h3> 
<p>FPGA-accelerated hardware simulation is by no means a new concept. However, previous attempts to use FPGAs for simulation have been fraught with usability, scalability, and cost issues. FireSim takes advantage of EC2 F1 and open-source hardware to address the traditional problems with FPGA-accelerated simulation:<br /> <em>Problem #1: FPGA-based simulations have traditionally been expensive, difficult to deploy, and difficult to reproduce.</em><br /> FireSim uses public-cloud infrastructure like F1, which means no upfront cost to purchase and deploy FPGAs. Developers and researchers can distribute pre-built AMIs and AFIs, as in this public demo (more details later in this post), to make experiments easy to reproduce. FireSim also automates most of the work involved in deploying an FPGA simulation, essentially enabling one-click conversion from new RTL to deploying on an FPGA cluster.</p> 
<p><em>Problem #2: FPGA-based simulations have traditionally been difficult (and expensive) to scale.</em><br /> Because FireSim uses F1, users can scale out experiments by spinning up additional EC2 instances, rather than spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on large FPGA clusters.</p> 
<p><em>Problem #3: Finding open hardware to simulate has traditionally been difficult.</em> <em>Finding open hardware that can run real software stacks is even harder.</em><br /> FireSim simulates <a href="https://github.com/freechipsproject/rocket-chip">RocketChip</a>, an open, silicon-proven, <a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a>-based processor platform, and adds peripherals like a NIC and disk device to build up a realistic system. Processors that implement RISC-V automatically support real operating systems (such as <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-linux">Linux</a>) and even support applications like Apache and Memcached. We provide a custom Buildroot-based FireSim Linux distribution that runs on our simulated nodes and includes many popular developer tools.</p> 
<p><em>Problem #4: Writing hardware in traditional HDLs is time-consuming.</em><br /> Both FireSim and RocketChip use the <a href="https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Chisel</a> HDL, which brings modern programming paradigms to hardware description languages. Chisel greatly simplifies the process of building large, highly parameterized hardware components.</p> 
<h3>How to use FireSim for hardware/software co-design</h3> 
<p>FireSim drastically improves the process of co-designing hardware and software by acting as a push-button interface for collaboration between hardware developers and systems software developers. The following diagram describes the workflows that hardware and software developers use when working with FireSim.</p> 
<a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/25/figure2-1.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-3122" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/25/figure2-1.jpeg" alt="" width="625" height="369" /></a> 
<p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2. The FireSim custom hardware development workflow.</p> 
<p>The hardware developer’s view:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Write custom RTL for your accelerator, peripheral, or processor modification in a productive language like Chisel.</li> 
<li>Run a software simulation of your hardware design in standard gate-level simulation tools for early-stage debugging.</li> 
<li>Run FireSim build scripts, which automatically build your simulation, run it through the Vivado toolchain/AWS shell scripts, and publish an AFI.</li> 
<li>Deploy your simulation on EC2 F1 using the generated simulation driver and AFI</li> 
<li>Run real software builds released by software developers to benchmark your hardware</li> 
</ol> 
<p>The software developer’s view:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Deploy the AMI/AFI generated by the hardware developer on an F1 instance to simulate a cluster of nodes (or scale out to many F1 nodes for larger simulated core-counts).</li> 
<li>Connect using SSH into the simulated nodes in the cluster and boot the Linux distribution included with FireSim. This distribution is easy to customize, and already supports many standard software packages.</li> 
<li>Directly prototype your software using the same exact interfaces that the software will see when deployed on the real future system you’re prototyping, with the same performance characteristics as observed from software, even at scale.</li>

<p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3. Cluster topology simulated by FireSim demo v1.0.</p> 
<p style="text-align: left">This first public demo of FireSim focuses on the aforementioned “software-developer’s view” of the custom hardware development cycle. The demo simulates a cluster of 1 to 8 RocketChip-based nodes, interconnected by a functional network simulation. The simulated nodes work just like “real” machines: &nbsp;they boot Linux, you can connect to them using SSH, and you can run real applications on top. The nodes can see each other (and the EC2 F1 instance on which they’re deployed) on the network and communicate with one another. While the demo currently simulates a pre-built “vanilla” cluster, the entire hardware configuration of these simulated nodes can be modified after FireSim is open-sourced.</p> 
<p>In this post, I walk through bringing up a single-node FireSim simulation for experienced EC2 F1 users. For more detailed instructions for new users and instructions for running a larger 8-node simulation, see <a href="https://fires.im/2017/08/29/firesim-demo-v1.0.html">FireSim Demo v1.0 on Amazon EC2 F1</a>. Both demos walk you through setting up an instance from a demo AMI/AFI and booting Linux on the simulated nodes. The full demo instructions also walk you through an example workload, running Memcached on the simulated nodes, with YCSB as a load generator to demonstrate network functionality.</p> 
<h3>Deploying the demo on F1</h3> 
<p>In this release, we provide pre-built binaries for driving simulation from the host and a pre-built AFI that contains the FPGA infrastructure necessary to simulate a RocketChip-based node.</p> 
<h3>Starting your F1 instances</h3> 
<p>First, launch an instance using the free <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B0758SR46G">FireSim Demo v1.0 product</a> available on the AWS Marketplace on an f1.2xlarge instance. After your instance has booted, log in using the user name centos. On the first login, you should see the message “FireSim network config completed.” This sets up the necessary tap interfaces and bridge on the EC2 instance to enable communicating with the simulated nodes.</p> 
<h3>AMI contents</h3> 
<p>The AMI contains a variety of tools to help you run simulations and build software for RISC-V systems, including the riscv64 toolchain, a Buildroot-based Linux distribution that runs on the simulated nodes, and the simulation driver program. For more details, see the <a href="https://fires.im/2017/08/29/firesim-demo-v1.0.html#ami-contents">AMI Contents</a> section on the FireSim website.</p> 
<h3>Single-node demo</h3> 
<p>First, you need to flash the FPGA with the FireSim AFI. To do so, run:</p> 
<p style="text-align: left"><em>[centos@ip-IP_ADDR ~]$ sudo fpga-load-local-image -S 0 -I agfi-00a74c2d615134b21</em></p> 
<p>To start a simulation, run the following at the command line:</p> 
<p style="text-align: left"><em>[centos@ip-IP_ADDR ~]$ boot-firesim-singlenode</em></p> 
<p>This automatically calls the simulation driver, telling it to load the Linux kernel image and root filesystem for the Linux distro. This produces output similar to the following:</p> 
<p style="text-align: left"><em>Simulations Started. You can use the UART console of each simulated node by attaching to the following screens:</em></p> 
<p style="text-align: left"><em>There is a screen on:</em></p> 
<p style="text-align: left"><em>2492.fsim0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Detached)</em></p> 
<p style="text-align: left"><em>1 Socket in /var/run/screen/S-centos.</em></p> 
<p>You could connect to the simulated UART console by connecting to this screen, but instead opt to use SSH to access the node instead.</p> 
<p>First, ping the node to make sure it has come online. This is currently required because nodes may get stuck at Linux boot if the NIC does not receive any network traffic. For more information, see <a href="https://fires.im/2017/08/29/firesim-demo-v1.0.html#troubleshooting-ping">Troubleshooting/Errata</a>. The node is always assigned the IP address 192.168.1.10:</p> 
<p style="text-align: left"><em>[centos@ip-IP_ADDR ~]$ ping 192.168.1.10</em></p> 
<p>This should eventually produce the following output:</p> 
<p><em>PING 192.168.1.10 (192.168.1.10) 56(84) bytes of data.</em></p> 
<p><em>From 192.168.1.1 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable</em></p> 
<p><em>…</em></p> 
<p><em>64 bytes from 192.168.1.10: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=2017 ms</em></p> 
<p><em>64 bytes from 192.168.1.10: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1018 ms</em></p> 
<p><em>64 bytes from 192.168.1.10: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=19.0 ms</em></p> 
<p><em>…</em></p> 
<p>At this point, you know that the simulated node is online. You can connect to it using SSH with the user name root and password firesim. It is also convenient to make sure that your TERM variable is set correctly. In this case, the simulation expects TERM=linux, so provide that:</p> 
<p><em>[centos@ip-IP_ADDR ~]$ TERM=linux ssh root@192.168.1.10</em></p> 
<p><em>The authenticity of host ‘192.168.1.10 (192.168.1.10)’ can’t be established.</em></p> 
<p><em>ECDSA key fingerprint is 63:e9:66:d0:5c:06:2c:1d:5c:95:33:c8:36:92:30:49.</em></p> 
<p><em>Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes</em></p> 
<p><em>Warning: Permanently added ‘192.168.1.10’ (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.</em></p> 
<p><em>root@192.168.1.10’s password:</em></p> 
<p><em>#</em></p> 
<p>At this point, you’re connected to the simulated node. Run uname -a as an example. You should see the following output, indicating that you’re connected to a RISC-V system:</p> 
<p><em># uname -a</em></p> 
<p><em>Linux buildroot 4.12.0-rc2 #1 Fri Aug 4 03:44:55 UTC 2017 riscv64 GNU/Linux</em></p> 
<p>Now you can run programs on the simulated node, as you would with a real machine. For an example workload (running YCSB against Memcached on the simulated node) or to run a larger 8-node simulation, see the full <a href="https://fires.im/2017/08/29/firesim-demo-v1.0.html">FireSim Demo v1.0 on Amazon EC2 F1 demo instructions</a>.</p> 
<p>Finally, when you are finished, you can shut down the simulated node by running the following command from within the simulated node:</p> 
<p style="text-align: left"><em># poweroff</em></p> 
<p>You can confirm that the simulation has ended by running screen -ls, which should now report that there are no detached screens.</p> 
<h3>Future plans</h3> 
<p>At Berkeley, we’re planning to keep improving the FireSim platform to enable our own research in future data center architectures, like <a href="https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference/protected-files/fast14_asanovic.pdf">FireBox</a>. The FireSim platform will eventually support more sophisticated processors, custom accelerators (such as <a href="http://hwacha.org/">Hwacha</a>), network models, and peripherals, in addition to scaling to larger numbers of FPGAs. In the future, we’ll open source the entire platform, including Midas, the tool used to transform RTL into FPGA simulators, allowing users to modify any part of the hardware/software stack. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/firesimproject">@firesimproject</a> on Twitter to stay tuned to future FireSim updates.</p>

<p>Customers often use public endpoints to perform cross-region replication or other application layer communication to remote regions. But a common problem is how do you protect these endpoints? It can be tempting to open up the security groups to the world due to the complexity of keeping security groups in sync across regions with a dynamically changing infrastructure.</p> 
<p>Consider a situation where you are running large clusters of instances in different regions that all require internode connectivity. One approach would be to use a VPN tunnel between regions to provide a secure tunnel over which to send your traffic. A good example of this is the <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/networking/transit-vpc/" target="null">Transit VPC Solution</a>, which is a published AWS solution to help customers quickly get up and running. However, this adds additional cost and complexity to your solution due to the newly required additional infrastructure.</p> 
<p>Another approach, which I’ll explore in this post, is to restrict access to the nodes by whitelisting the public IP addresses of your hosts in the opposite region. Today, I’ll outline a solution that allows for cross-region security group updates, can handle remote region failures, and supports external actions such as manually terminating instances or adding instances to an existing <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling" target="null">Auto Scaling</a> group.<span id="more-2861"></span></p> 
<b>Solution overview</b> 
<p>The overview of this solution is diagrammed below. Although this post covers limiting access to your instances, you should still implement encryption to protect your data in transit.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2873" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/15/1-topology.png" alt="" width="973" height="524" /></p> 
<p>If your entire infrastructure is running in a single region, you can reference a security group as the source, allowing your IP addresses to change without any updates required. However, if you’re going across the public internet between regions to perform things like application-level traffic or cross-region replication, this is no longer an option. Security groups are regional. When you go across regions it can be tempting to drop security to enable this communication.</p> 
<p>Although using an Elastic IP address can provide you with a static IP address that you can define as a source for your security groups, this may not always be feasible, especially when automatic scaling is desired.</p> 
<p>In this example scenario, you have a distributed database that requires full internode communication for replication. If you place a cluster in us-east-1 and us-west-2, you must provide a secure method of communication between the two. Because the database uses cloud best practices, you can add or remove nodes as the load varies.</p> 
<p>To start the process of updating your security groups, you must know when an instance has come online to trigger your workflow. Auto Scaling groups have the concept of <a title="undefined" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html" target="null">lifecycle hooks</a> that enable you to perform custom actions as the group launches or terminates instances.</p> 
<p>When Auto Scaling begins to launch or terminate an instance, it puts the instance into a wait state (<code>Pending:Wait</code> or <code>Terminating:Wait</code>). The instance remains in this state while you perform your various actions until either you tell Auto Scaling to <code>Continue</code>, <code>Abandon</code>, or the timeout period ends. A lifecycle hook can trigger a CloudWatch event, publish to an Amazon SNS topic, or send to an Amazon SQS queue. For this example, you use <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch" target="null">CloudWatch Events</a> to trigger an <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda" target="null">AWS Lambda</a> function that updates an <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb" target="null">Amazon DynamoDB</a> table.</p> 
<b>Component breakdown</b> 
<p>Here’s a quick breakdown of the components involved in this solution:</p> 
<p style="padding-left: 30px">• Lambda function<br /> • CloudWatch event<br /> • DynamoDB table</p> 
<h3>Lambda function</h3> 
<p>The Lambda function automatically updates your security groups, in the following way:</p> 
<p style="padding-left: 30px">1. Determines whether a change was triggered by your Auto Scaling group lifecycle hook or manually invoked for a “true up” functionality, which I discuss later in this post.<br /> 2. Describes the instances in the Auto Scaling group and obtain public IP addresses for each instance.<br /> 3. Updates both local and remote DynamoDB tables.<br /> 4. Compares the list of public IP addresses for both local and remote clusters with what’s already in the local region security group. Update the security group.<br /> 5. Compares the list of public IP addresses for both local and remote clusters with what’s already in the remote region security group. Update the security group<br /> 6. Signals <code>CONTINUE</code> back to the lifecycle hook.</p> 
<h3>CloudWatch event</h3> 
<p>The CloudWatch event triggers when an instance passes through either the <code>launching</code> or <code>terminating</code> states. When the Lambda function gets invoked, it receives an event that looks like the following:</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-json">{
&quot;account&quot;: &quot;123456789012&quot;,
&quot;region&quot;: &quot;us-east-1&quot;,
&quot;detail&quot;: {
&quot;LifecycleHookName&quot;: &quot;hook-launching&quot;,
&quot;AutoScalingGroupName&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
&quot;LifecycleActionToken&quot;: &quot;33965228-086a-4aeb-8c26-f82ed3bef495&quot;,
&quot;LifecycleTransition&quot;: &quot;autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_LAUNCHING&quot;,
&quot;EC2InstanceId&quot;: &quot;i-017425ec54f22f994&quot;
},
&quot;detail-type&quot;: &quot;EC2 Instance-launch Lifecycle Action&quot;,
&quot;source&quot;: &quot;aws.autoscaling&quot;,
&quot;version&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
&quot;time&quot;: &quot;2017-05-03T02:20:59Z&quot;,
&quot;id&quot;: &quot;cb930cf8-ce8b-4b6c-8011-af17966eb7e2&quot;,
&quot;resources&quot;: [
&quot;arn:aws:autoscaling:us-east-1:123456789012:autoScalingGroup:d3fe9d96-34d0-4c62-b9bb-293a41ba3765:autoScalingGroupName/&quot;
]
}</code></pre> 
<h3>DynamoDB table</h3> 
<p>You use DynamoDB to store lists of remote IP addresses in a local table that is updated by the opposite region as a failsafe source of truth. Although you can describe your Auto Scaling group for the local region, you must maintain a list of IP addresses for the remote region.</p> 
<p>To minimize the number of describe calls and prevent an issue in the remote region from blocking your local scaling actions, we keep a list of the remote IP addresses in a local DynamoDB table. Each Lambda function in each region is responsible for updating the public IP addresses of its Auto Scaling group for both the local and remote tables.</p> 
<p>As with all the infrastructure in this solution, there is a DynamoDB table in both regions that mirror each other. For example, the following screenshot shows a sample DynamoDB table. The Lambda function in <code>us-east-1</code> would update the DynamoDB entry for <code>us-east-1</code> in both tables in both regions.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2878" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/15/2-ddb.png" alt="" width="975" height="123" /></p> 
<p>By updating a DynamoDB table in both regions, it allows the local region to gracefully handle issues with the remote region, which would otherwise prevent your ability to scale locally. If the remote region becomes inaccessible, you have a copy of the latest configuration from the table that you can use to continue to sync with your security groups. When the remote region comes back online, it pushes its updated public IP addresses to the DynamoDB table. The security group is updated to reflect the current status by the remote Lambda function.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<b>Walkthrough</b> 
<p><strong>Note: All of the following steps are performed in both regions. The Launch Stack buttons will default to the us-east-1 region.</strong></p> 
<p>Here’s a quick overview of the steps involved in this process:</p> 
<p style="padding-left: 30px">1. An instance is launched or terminated, which triggers an Auto Scaling group lifecycle hook, triggering the Lambda function via CloudWatch Events.<br /> 2. The Lambda function retrieves the list of public IP addresses for all instances in the local region Auto Scaling group.<br /> 3. The Lambda function updates the local and remote region DynamoDB tables with the public IP addresses just received for the local Auto Scaling group.<br /> 4. The Lambda function updates the local region security group with the public IP addresses, removing and adding to ensure that it mirrors what is present for the local and remote Auto Scaling groups.<br /> 5. The Lambda function updates the remote region security group with the public IP addresses, removing and adding to ensure that it mirrors what is present for the local and remote Auto Scaling groups.</p> 
<h3>Prerequisites</h3> 
<p>To deploy this solution, you need to have Auto Scaling groups, launch configurations, and a base security group in both regions. To expedite this process, <a title="undefined" href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-automating-security-group-updates/blob/master/templates/prerequisites.yml" target="null">this CloudFormation template</a> can be launched in both regions.</p> 
<p><a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=Prerequisites&amp;templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/computeblog-us-east-1/automate-sg-lambda/prerequisites.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2719" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/08/17/2-launch.png" alt="" width="144" height="27" /></a></p> 
<h3>Step 1: Launch the AWS SAM template in the first region</h3> 
<p>To make the deployment process easy, I’ve created an <a title="undefined" href="https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model" target="null">AWS Serverless Application Model</a> (AWS SAM) template, which is a new specification that makes it easier to manage and deploy serverless applications on AWS. This template creates the following resources:</p> 
<p style="padding-left: 30px">• A Lambda function, to perform the various security group actions<br /> • A DynamoDB table, to track the state of the local and remote Auto Scaling groups<br /> • Auto Scaling group lifecycle hooks for instance launching and terminating<br /> • A CloudWatch event, to track the <code>EC2 Instance-Launch Lifecycle-Action</code> and <code>EC2 Instance-terminate Lifecycle-Action</code> events<br /> • A pointer from the CloudWatch event to the Lambda function, and the necessary permissions</p> 
<p>Download the template from <a title="undefined" href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-automating-security-group-updates/blob/master/templates/master.yml" target="null">here</a> or click to launch.</p> 
<p><a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=Master&amp;templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/computeblog-us-east-1/automate-sg-lambda/master.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2719" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/08/17/2-launch.png" alt="" /></a></p> 
<p>Upon launching the template, you’ll be presented with a list of parameters which includes the remote/local names for your Auto Scaling Groups, AWS region, Security Group IDs, DynamoDB table names, as well as where the code for the Lambda function is located. Because this is the first region you’re launching the stack in, fill out all the parameters except for the <em>RemoteTable</em> parameter as it hasn’t been created yet (you fill this in later).</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2880" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/15/3-cfn.png" alt="" width="1436" height="1322" /></p> 
<h3>Step 2: Test the local region</h3> 
<p>After the stack has finished launching, you can test the local region. Open the EC2 console and find the Auto Scaling group that was created when launching the prerequisite stack. Change the desired number of instances from 0 to 1.</p> 
<p>For both regions, check your security group to verify that the public IP address of the instance created is now in the security group.</p> 
<p>Local region:</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2883" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/15/4-local-sg.png" alt="" width="975" height="117" /></p> 
<p>Remote region:</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2884" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/15/5-remote-sg.png" alt="" width="975" height="129" /></p> 
<p>Now, change the desired number of instances for your group back to 0 and verify that the rules are properly removed.</p> 
<p>Local region:</p>

<p>Remote region:</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2886" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/15/7-remote-sg.png" alt="" width="975" height="87" /></p> 
<h3>Step 3: Launch in the remote region</h3> 
<p>When you deploy a Lambda function using CloudFormation, the Lambda zip file needs to reside in the same region you are launching the template. Once you choose your remote region, create an Amazon S3 bucket and upload the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/computeblog-us-east-1/automate-sg-lambda/auto-sg-updater.zip">Lambda zip file</a> there. Next, go to the remote region and launch the same SAM template as before, but make sure you update the <strong>CodeBucket</strong> and <strong>CodeKey</strong> parameters. Also, because this is the second launch, you now have all the values and can fill out all the parameters, specifically the <em>RemoteTable</em> value.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Step 4: Update the local region Lambda environment variable</h3> 
<p>When you originally launched the template in the local region, you didn’t have the name of the DynamoDB table for the remote region, because you hadn’t created it yet. Now that you have launched the remote template, you can perform a CloudFormation stack update on the initial SAM template. This populates the remote DynamoDB table name into the initial Lambda function’s environment variables.</p> 
<p>In the CloudFormation console in the initial region, select the stack. Under <strong>Actions</strong>, choose <strong>Update Stack</strong>, and select the SAM template used for both regions. Under <strong>Parameters</strong>, populate the remote DynamoDB table name, as shown below. Choose <strong>Next</strong> and let the stack update complete. This updates your Lambda function and completes the setup process.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2891" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/15/8-CFN.png" alt="" width="1454" height="1322" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Step 5: Final testing</h3> 
<p>You now have everything fully configured and in place to trigger security group changes based on instances being added or removed to your Auto Scaling groups in both regions. Test this by changing the desired capacity of your group in both regions.</p> 
<p>True up functionality<br /> If an instance is manually added or removed from the Auto Scaling group, the lifecycle hooks don’t get triggered. To account for this, the Lambda function supports a “true up” functionality in which the function can be manually invoked. If you paste in the following JSON text for your test event, it kicks off the entire workflow. For added peace of mind, you can also have this function fire via a CloudWatch event with a CRON expression for nearly continuous checking.</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-json">{
&quot;detail&quot;: {
&quot;AutoScalingGroupName&quot;: &quot;&lt;your ASG name&gt;&quot;
},
&quot;trueup&quot;:true
}</code></pre> 
<b>Extra credit</b> 
<p>Now that all the resources are created in both regions, go back and break down the policy to incorporate resource-level permissions for specific security groups, Auto Scaling groups, and the DynamoDB tables.</p> 
<p>Although this post is centered around using public IP addresses for your instances, you could instead use a VPN between regions. In this case, you would still be able to use this solution to scope down the security groups to the cluster instances. However, the code would need to be modified to support private IP addresses.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<b>Conclusion</b> 
<p>At this point, you now have a mechanism in place that captures when a new instance is added to or removed from your cluster and updates the security groups in both regions. This ensures that you are locking down your infrastructure securely by allowing access only to other cluster members.</p> 
<p>Keep in mind that this architecture (lifecycle hooks, CloudWatch event, Lambda function, and DynamoDB table) requires that the infrastructure to be deployed in both regions, to have synchronization going both ways.</p> 
<p>Because this Lambda function is modifying security group rules, it’s important to have an audit log of what has been modified and who is modifying them. The out-of-the-box function provides logs in CloudWatch for what IP addresses are being added and removed for which ports. As these are all API calls being made, they are logged in CloudTrail and can be traced back to the IAM role that you created for your lifecycle hooks. This can provide historical data that can be used for troubleshooting or auditing purposes.</p> 
<p>Security is paramount at AWS. We want to ensure that customers are protecting access to their resources. This solution helps you keep your security groups in both regions automatically in sync with your Auto Scaling group resources. Let us know if you have any questions or other solutions you’ve come up with!</p>

<p>With the recent launch of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/">Lambda@Edge</a>, it’s now possible for you to provide even more robust functionality to your static websites. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront">Amazon CloudFront</a> is a content distribution network service. In this post, I show how you can use Lambda@Edge along with the CloudFront origin access identity (OAI) for Amazon S3 and still provide simple URLs (such as www.example.com/about/ instead of www.example.com/about/index.html).<span id="more-2895"></span></p> 
<h3>Background</h3> 
<p>Amazon S3 is a great platform for <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html">hosting a static website</a>. You don’t need to worry about managing servers or underlying infrastructure—you just publish your static to content to an S3 bucket. S3 provides a DNS name such as &lt;<strong>bucket-name</strong>&gt;.s3-website-&lt;<strong>AWS-region</strong>&gt;.amazonaws.com. Use this name for your website by creating a CNAME record in your domain’s DNS environment (or Amazon Route 53) as follows:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>www.example.com -&gt; &lt;<strong>bucket-name</strong>&gt;.s3-website-&lt;<strong>AWS-region</strong>&gt;.amazonaws.com</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>You can also put CloudFront in front of S3 to further scale the performance of your site and cache the content closer to your users. CloudFront can enable HTTPS-hosted sites, by either using a custom Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate or a managed certificate from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-certificate-manager-deploy-ssltls-based-apps-on-aws/">AWS Certificate Manager</a>. In addition, CloudFront also offers integration with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/waf/">AWS WAF</a>, a web application firewall. As you can see, it’s possible to achieve some robust functionality by using S3, CloudFront, and other managed services and not have to worry about maintaining underlying infrastructure.</p> 
<p>One of the key concerns that you might have when implementing any type of WAF or CDN is that you want to force your users to go through the CDN. If you implement CloudFront in front of S3, you can achieve this by using an <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html">OAI</a>. However, in order to do this, you cannot use the HTTP endpoint that is exposed by S3’s static website hosting feature. Instead, CloudFront must use the S3 REST endpoint to fetch content from your origin so that the request can be authenticated using the OAI. This presents some challenges in that the REST endpoint does not support redirection to a default index page.</p> 
<p>CloudFront does allow you to specify a default root object (index.html), but it only works on the root of the website (such as http://www.example.com &gt; http://www.example.com/index.html). It does not work on any subdirectory (such as http://www.example.com/about/). If you were to attempt to request this URL through CloudFront, CloudFront would do a S3 GetObject API call against a key that does not exist.</p> 
<p>Of course, it is a bad user experience to expect users to always type index.html at the end of every URL (or even know that it should be there). Until now, there has not been an easy way to provide these simpler URLs (equivalent to the DirectoryIndex Directive in an Apache Web Server configuration) to users through CloudFront. Not if you still want to be able to restrict access to the S3 origin using an OAI. However, with the release of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/">Lambda@Edge</a>, you can use a JavaScript function running on the CloudFront edge nodes to look for these patterns and request the appropriate object key from the S3 origin.</p> 
<h3>Solution</h3> 
<p>In this example, you use the compute power at the CloudFront edge to inspect the request as it’s coming in from the client. Then re-write the request so that CloudFront requests a default index object (index.html in this case) for any request URI that ends in ‘/’.</p> 
<p>When a request is made against a web server, the client specifies the object to obtain in the request. You can use this URI and apply a regular expression to it so that these URIs get resolved to a default index object before CloudFront requests the object from the origin. Use the following code:</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-js">'use strict';
exports.handler = (event, context, callback) =&gt; {
// Extract the request from the CloudFront event that is sent to Lambda@Edge 
var request = event.Records[0].cf.request;
// Extract the URI from the request
var olduri = request.uri;
// Match any '/' that occurs at the end of a URI. Replace it with a default index
var newuri = olduri.replace(/\/$/, '\/index.html');
// Log the URI as received by CloudFront and the new URI to be used to fetch from origin
console.log(&quot;Old URI: &quot; + olduri);
console.log(&quot;New URI: &quot; + newuri);
// Replace the received URI with the URI that includes the index page
request.uri = newuri;
// Return to CloudFront
return callback(null, request);
};
</code></pre> 
<p>To get started, create an S3 bucket to be the origin for CloudFront:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/17/Picture1-1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2897 size-large" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/17/Picture1-1-921x1024.png" alt="Create bucket" width="640" height="712" /></a></p> 
<p>On the other screens, you can just accept the defaults for the purposes of this walkthrough. If this were a production implementation, I would recommend enabling bucket logging and specifying an existing S3 bucket as the destination for access logs. These logs can be useful if you need to troubleshoot issues with your S3 access.</p> 
<p>Now, put some content into your S3 bucket. For this walkthrough, create two simple webpages to demonstrate the functionality: &nbsp;A page that resides at the website root, and another that is in a subdirectory.</p> 
<p><strong>&lt;s3bucketname&gt;/index.html</strong></p> 
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Root home page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, this page resides in the root directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre> 
<p><strong>&lt;s3bucketname&gt;/subdirectory/index.html</strong></p> 
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Subdirectory home page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, this page resides in the /subdirectory/ directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre> 
<p>When uploading the files into S3, you can accept the defaults. You add a bucket policy as part of the CloudFront distribution creation that allows CloudFront to access the S3 origin. You should now have an S3 bucket that looks like the following:</p> 
<a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/20/S3root.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2904" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/20/S3root.png" alt="" width="974" height="437" /></a> 
<p class="wp-caption-text">Root of bucket</p> 
<a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/20/S3subdirectory.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-2905" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/20/S3subdirectory.png" alt="" width="975" height="387" /></a> 
<p class="wp-caption-text">Subdirectory in bucket</p> 
<p>Next, create a CloudFront distribution that your users will use to access the content. Open the CloudFront console, and choose <strong>Create Distribution</strong>. For <strong>Select a delivery method for your content</strong>, under <strong>Web</strong>, choose <strong>Get Started</strong>.</p> 
<p>On the next screen, you set up the distribution. Below are the options to configure:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Origin Domain Name</strong>: &nbsp;Select the S3 bucket that you created earlier.</li> 
<li><strong>Restrict Bucket Access:&nbsp;</strong>Choose&nbsp;<strong>Yes</strong>.</li> 
<li><strong>Origin Access Identity:&nbsp;</strong>Create a new identity.</li> 
<li><strong>Grant Read Permissions on Bucket</strong>: Choose&nbsp;<strong>Yes, Update Bucket Policy</strong>.</li> 
<li><strong>Object Caching</strong>: Choose&nbsp;<strong>Customize</strong> (I am changing the behavior to avoid having CloudFront cache objects, as this could affect your ability to troubleshoot while implementing the Lambda code). 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Minimum TTL</strong>: 0</li> 
<li><strong>Maximum TTL</strong>: 0</li> 
<li><strong>Default TTL</strong>: 0</li> 
</ul> </li> 
</ul> 
<p>You can accept all of the other defaults. Again, this is a proof-of-concept exercise. After you are comfortable that the CloudFront distribution is working properly with the origin and Lambda code, you can re-visit the preceding values and make changes before implementing it in production.</p> 
<p>CloudFront distributions can take several minutes to deploy (because the changes have to propagate out to all of the edge locations). After that’s done, test the functionality of the S3-backed static website. Looking at the distribution, you can see that CloudFront assigns a domain name:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/20/CfDistribution-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2908" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/20/CfDistribution-1.png" alt="CloudFront Distribution Settings" width="974" height="518" /></a></p> 
<p>Try to access the website using a combination of various URLs:</p>

<p>If you use a tool such like cURL to test this, you notice that CloudFront and S3 are returning a blank response. The reason for this is that the subdirectory does exist, but it does not resolve to an S3 object. Keep in mind that S3 is an object store, so there are no real directories. User interfaces such as the S3 console present a hierarchical view of a bucket with folders based on the presence of forward slashes, but behind the scenes the bucket is just a collection of keys that represent stored objects.</p>

<p>This request works as expected because you are referencing the object directly. Now, you implement the Lambda@Edge function to return the default index.html page for any subdirectory. Looking at the example JavaScript code, here’s where the magic happens:</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-js">var newuri = olduri.replace(/\/$/, '\/index.html');
</code></pre> 
<p>You are going to use a JavaScript regular expression to match any ‘/’ that occurs at the end of the URI and replace it with ‘/index.html’. This is the equivalent to what S3 does on its own with static website hosting. However, as I mentioned earlier, you can’t rely on this if you want to use a policy on the bucket to restrict it so that users must access the bucket through CloudFront. That way, all requests to the S3 bucket must be authenticated using the S3 REST API. Because of this, you implement a Lambda@Edge function that takes any client request ending in ‘/’ and append a default ‘index.html’ to the request before requesting the object from the origin.</p> 
<p>In the Lambda console, choose <strong>Create function</strong>. On the next screen, skip the blueprint selection and choose <strong>Author from scratch</strong>, as you’ll use the sample code provided.</p> 
<p>Next, configure the trigger. Choosing the empty box shows a list of available triggers. Choose <strong>CloudFront</strong> and select your CloudFront distribution ID (created earlier). For this example, leave <strong>Cache Behavior</strong> as <strong>*</strong> and <strong>CloudFront Event</strong> as <strong>Origin Request</strong>. Select the <strong>Enable trigger and replicate box</strong> and choose <strong>Next</strong>.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/20/LambdaTrigger.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2907" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/20/LambdaTrigger.png" alt="Lambda Trigger" width="974" height="981" /></a></p> 
<p>Next, give the function a name and a description. Then, copy and paste the following code:</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-js">'use strict';
exports.handler = (event, context, callback) =&gt; {
// Extract the request from the CloudFront event that is sent to Lambda@Edge 
var request = event.Records[0].cf.request;
// Extract the URI from the request
var olduri = request.uri;
// Match any '/' that occurs at the end of a URI. Replace it with a default index
var newuri = olduri.replace(/\/$/, '\/index.html');
// Log the URI as received by CloudFront and the new URI to be used to fetch from origin
console.log(&quot;Old URI: &quot; + olduri);
console.log(&quot;New URI: &quot; + newuri);
// Replace the received URI with the URI that includes the index page
request.uri = newuri;
// Return to CloudFront
return callback(null, request);
};
</code></pre> 
<p>Next, define a role that grants permissions to the Lambda function. For this example, choose <strong>Create new role from template</strong>, <strong>Basic Edge Lambda permissions</strong>. This creates a new IAM role for the Lambda function and grants the following permissions:</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-json">{
&quot;Version&quot;: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;,
&quot;Statement&quot;: [
{
&quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,
&quot;Action&quot;: [
&quot;logs:CreateLogGroup&quot;,
&quot;logs:CreateLogStream&quot;,
&quot;logs:PutLogEvents&quot;
],
&quot;Resource&quot;: [
&quot;arn:aws:logs:*:*:*&quot;
]
}
]
}
</code></pre> 
<p>In a nutshell, these are the permissions that the function needs to create the necessary CloudWatch log group and log stream, and to put the log events so that the function is able to write logs when it executes.</p> 
<p>After the function has been created, you can go back to the browser (or cURL) and re-run the test for the subdirectory request that failed previously:</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-xml">› curl -v http://d3gt20ea1hllb.cloudfront.net/subdirectory/

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/xray/"> AWS X-Ray </a> helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. With X-Ray, you can understand how your application and its underlying services are performing to identify and troubleshoot the root cause of performance issues and errors. It allows you to view, filter, and gain insights to identify issues and opportunities for optimization.</p> 
<p>X-Ray helps you to both understand the performance of your app and to annotate important parameters. In this post, I look at a sample <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/">Amazon Rekognition</a> app that stores images in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>. The app calls the&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/API_RecognizeCelebrities.html"><code class="lang-json">RecognizeCelebrities</code></a> action from an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/"> AWS Lambda </a> function. The function uses X-Ray features to analyze the app’s performance in recognizing any celebrity in a single image or in multiple images. These features include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Annotations and traces</li> 
<li>Histogram</li> 
<li>Metadata</li> 
<li>Exceptions</li> 
</ul> 
<p><span id="more-2975"></span></p> 
<b>Sample app overview</b> 
<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-xray-rekognition-lambda-sample">sample app</a>, you can upload images and store them in the <strong>imagestoragexray</strong> bucket. Then you can choose <strong>Recognize faces</strong> for an individual image. This calls a Lambda function, which then calls <code class="lang-json">RecognizeCelebrities</code> to recognize the celebrities in the image. The Lambda function returns to the client a comma-separated list of celebrities that it found in the image.</p> 
<a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/11/architecture-1024x576-1.png"><img class="wp-image-3045 size-full" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/11/architecture-1024x576-1.png" alt="" width="742" height="544" /></a> 
<p class="wp-caption-text">Overview of the sample app’s architecture</p> 
<a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/10/servicemap.png"><img class="wp-image-3001" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/10/servicemap-1024x472.png" alt="X-Ray service map from the sample app" width="803" height="375" /></a> 
<p class="wp-caption-text">X-Ray service map from the sample app</p> 
<p>To search for a celebrity in the collection of images, you can type the celebrity’s name in the text box and choose <strong>Search celeb</strong>. This calls another Lambda function that runs <code class="lang-json">RecognizeCelebrities</code> on all the images in the <strong>imagestoragexray</strong> bucket. The Lambda function then returns the number of times that the celebrity was found in all the images.</p> 
<a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/10/Picture3.png"><img class="wp-image-2978 size-full" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/10/Picture3.png" alt="Example of sample app" width="975" height="434" /></a> 
<p class="wp-caption-text">Example of a sample app webpage with stored images</p> 
<b>Annotations and traces</b> 
<p>Annotations are indexed for grouping traces in the X-Ray console, based on parameters stored in the annotations. Annotations help you determine the performance of particular images.</p> 
<p>Using annotations to record the celebrity image file name, you can filter to see traces for performance of your app on specific images. For example, all the celebrities recognized in the analyzed images are annotated with the average confidence with which Amazon Rekognition matched the celebrity. The number of faces found in an image is also annotated.</p> 
<p>Resourceful annotations such as these provide you with a comprehensive outlook about your app’s performance.</p> 
<a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/10/annotations.png"><img class="wp-image-3002 " src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/10/annotations-1024x388.png" alt="X-Ray annotation in the sample app" width="834" height="322" /></a>

<h3>Understanding Lambda function cold starts</h3> 
<p>When a Lambda function is invoked for the first time, or after it’s updated, Lambda launches a container based on the configuration settings that you provided. It takes time to set up a container and do the necessary bootstrapping, also known as a cold start.</p> 
<p>The latency of a Lambda function is the amount of time between when a request starts and when it completes. Due to the cold start behavior, Lambda function executions may take longer on the first invocation or after a function has been updated. For subsequent invocations, Lambda tries to reuse the container to reduce the latency.</p> 
<p>X-Ray helps you trace the cold start time as well as the overall latency for a Lambda function. In the following screenshot showing the 3.5-second duration of the Lambda function, you see that it took 473 milliseconds to initialize the function. For more information about execution time, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-introduction.html">AWS Lambda: How It Works</a>.</p> 
<a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/11/coldstart.png"><img class="wp-image-3048 " src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/11/coldstart-1024x441.png" alt="X-Ray trace showing initialization time for the Lambda function" width="821" height="354" /></a>

<p class="wp-caption-text">X-Ray trace on subsequent invocations of the Lambda function without the cold start</p> 
<h3>Determining the time for image analysis on celebrities</h3> 
<p>You can determine that the time Amazon Rekognition takes differs with the number of celebrity images in the photo. For example, a photo without a celebrity takes a shorter time to process, compared to a photo with a celebrity that Amazon Rekognition was able to recognize. In the following screenshots, you can see that the Lambda function that calls Amazon Rekognition to find images with Steve Jobs took 1.7 seconds to complete. This is compared to 858 milliseconds, using the same Lambda function for an image with a random landscape</p> 
<a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/11/stevejobslandscape.png"><img class="wp-image-3052 " src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/11/stevejobslandscape-1024x189.png" alt="X-Ray trace showing the time that a Lambda function takes to call Amazon Rekognition and return" width="933" height="172" /></a> 
<p class="wp-caption-text">X-Ray trace showing the time that a Lambda function takes to call Amazon Rekognition and return</p> 
<p>By choosing the particular traces that show up in the trace list for your annotation filter, you can investigate further. Specifically, you can look at the performance of your Amazon Rekognition call.</p> 
<p>Amazon Rekognition took 1.3 seconds to analyze and provide results for the image with Steve Jobs. However, it took only 829 milliseconds to analyze and provide results for the random landscape image.</p> 
<a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/11/stevejobstrace.png"><img class="wp-image-3053 " src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/11/stevejobstrace-1024x424.png" alt="X-Ray trace showing the time that Amazon Rekognition takes to analyze the Steve Jobs image" width="814" height="337" /></a>

<p class="wp-caption-text">X-Ray trace showing the time that Amazon Rekognition takes to analyze the random landscape image</p> 
<h3>Determining the time for image analysis on multiple faces</h3> 
<p>X-Ray can also help you to look at the performance of your app for images with multiple faces. Using the annotations feature, you can record the number of faces that Amazon Rekognition recognized in the image. Through this annotation, you can filter traces for images with a specific number of face counts that were recognized or not recognized in Amazon Rekognition, as shown in the following screenshot.</p> 
<a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/11/multiplefaces-facecount.png"><img class="wp-image-3056 " src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/11/multiplefaces-facecount-1024x221.png" alt="X-Ray annotations for face counts in images recognized by Amazon Rekognition" width="807" height="174" /></a> 
<p class="wp-caption-text">X-Ray annotations for face counts in images recognized by Amazon Rekognition</p> 
<p>In the images below, notice that Amazon Rekognition takes more time to analyze images that contain more faces. For example, Amazon Rekognition took 8.9 seconds to analyze an image with 15 faces compared to only 6.0 seconds for an image with 5 faces. You can use the filter expression <em>Annotation.Facecount &gt; “5”</em> to view requests for which Amazon Rekognition recognized more than 5 faces.</p> 
<a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/11/facecount15trace-1.png"><img class="wp-image-3061 " src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/11/facecount15trace-1-1024x405.png" alt="X-Ray traces for an image with 15 face counts" width="815" height="322" /></a>

<p class="wp-caption-text">X-Ray traces for an image with 5 face counts</p> 
<b>Histograms</b> 
<p>When you select a node or edge on an X-Ray service map, the console shows a latency distribution histogram. It shows duration on the x-axis, and the percentage of requests that match each duration on the y-axis. Using this histogram, you can look at calls that have a high latency and try to improve their performance.</p> 
<h3>Using the latency histogram</h3> 
<p>In your service map, you can choose individual nodes to look at the response latency for calls. When you choose the Amazon Rekognition node AWS::rekognition in the service map, you can see the corresponding response latency from Amazon Rekognition, as shown in the following screenshot.</p> 
<a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/10/xraylatency.png"><img class="wp-image-3017 " src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/10/xraylatency-1024x783.png" alt="X-Ray response distribution histogram for response latency" width="757" height="571" /></a> 
<p class="wp-caption-text">X-Ray response distribution histogram for response latency</p> 
<p>Notice that the response latency increases with the number of face counts in the image. As you noted previously, image analysis time also increases with the face count increase.</p> 
<p>For example, the random landscape image’s response latency is less than 1 second, whereas calls to Amazon Rekognition for images with one face count have a response latency between 1 second and 1.5 seconds. Images with multiple face counts have a much higher response latency, greater than 1.5 seconds.</p>

<b>Metadata</b> 
<p>The metadata feature in X-Ray enables you to store app information for later reference. However, you cannot filter out traces based on the metadata. The sample app stores the response from Amazon Rekognition in metadata for your reference.</p> 
<a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/10/metadata.png"><img class="wp-image-3011 " src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/10/metadata-1024x549.png" alt="X-Ray metadata in the sample app" width="807" height="439" /></a> 
<p class="wp-caption-text">X-Ray metadata in the sample app</p> 
<b>Exceptions</b> 
<p>X-Ray also provides information on exceptions from other AWS services in the trace. For the sample app, Amazon Rekognition responded back with an exception when the RecognizeCelebrities call was made on a non-image file. You can also filter requests that had an exception in Amazon Rekognition, using the following expression:<br /> <code>service(&quot;rekognition&quot;) { error = true }</code></p>

<b>Summary</b> 
<p>X-Ray helps you analyze your app and its performance. Through the annotations feature, you can index and filter specific traces. Annotating specific parameters in your app helps you get a comprehensive overview of your app’s performance specific to these parameters. The histogram helps you analyze calls with high response latency and gives you visibility into the time that individual services take. The metadata feature helps you store any relevant information that might be useful to improve your app’s performance. X-Ray also provides information on exceptions that happened on a particular trace to an AWS service.</p> 
<p>Overall, by using X-Ray you can both improve performance of your app and understand the underlying services that your app uses. Use this information to troubleshoot and improve specific portions of your app, and save both time and money.</p>

<p><em>This post comes from the desk of Brent Langston.</em></p> 
<p>—</p> 
<p>Starting today, customers can keep their container image repositories tidy by automatically removing old or unused images using <strong>lifecycle policies</strong>, now available as part of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr">Amazon EC2 Container Registry (Amazon ECR)</a>.</p> 
<p>Amazon ECR is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy to store manage and deploy Docker container images without worrying about the typical challenges of scaling a service to handle pulling hundreds of images at one time. This scale means that development teams using Amazon ECR actively often find that their repositories fill up with many container image versions. This makes it difficult to find the code changes that matter and incurs unnecessary storage costs. Previously, cleaning up your repository meant spending time to manually delete old images, or writing and executing scripts.</p> 
<p>Now, lifecycle policies allow you to define a set of rules to remove old container images automatically. You can also preview rules to see exactly which container images are affected when the rule runs. This allows repositories to be better organized, makes it easier to find the code revisions that matter, and lowers storage costs.</p> 
<p>Let’s take a look&nbsp;at how lifecycle policies work.</p> 
<p><span id="more-3025"></span></p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3065" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/10/11/ecr-lifecyclepolicies.png" alt="" width="907" height="605" /></p> 
<b>Ground&nbsp;Rules</b> 
<p>One of the biggest benefits of deploying code in containers is the ability to quickly and easily roll back to a previous version. You can deploy with less risk because, if something goes wrong, it is easy to revert back to the previous container version and know that your application will run like it did before the failed deployment. Most people probably never roll back past a few versions. If your situation is similar, then one simple lifecycle rule might be to just keep the last 30 images.</p> 
<h3>Last 30 Images</h3> 
<p>In your ECR registry, choose <strong>Dry-Run Lifecycle Rules, Add</strong>.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>For <strong>Image Status</strong>, select <strong>Untagged</strong>.</li> 
<li>Under <strong>Match criteria</strong>, for <strong>Count Type</strong>, enter <strong>Image Count More Than</strong>.</li> 
<li>For <strong>Count Number</strong>, enter <strong>30</strong>.</li> 
<li>For <strong>Rule action</strong>, choose <strong>expire</strong>.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Choose <strong>Save</strong>. To see which images would be cleaned up, <strong>Save and dry-run rules</strong>.</p> 
<p>Of course, there are teams who, for compliance reasons, might prefer to keep certain images for a period of time, rather than keeping by count. For that situation, you can choose to clean up images older than 90 days.</p> 
<h3>Last 90 Days</h3> 
<p>Select the rule that you just created and choose Edit. Change the parameters to keep only 90 days of untagged images:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Under <strong>Match criteria</strong>, for <strong>Count Type</strong>, enter <strong>Since Image Pushed</strong></li> 
<li>For <strong>Count Number</strong>, enter <strong>90</strong>.</li> 
<li>For <strong>Count Unit</strong>, enter <strong>days</strong>.</li> 
</ul> 
<b>Tags</b> 
<p>Certainly 90 days is an arbitrary timeframe, and your team might have policies in place that would require a longer timeframe for certain kinds of images. If that’s the case, but you still want to continue with the spring cleaning, you can consider getting rid of images that are tag prefixed.</p> 
<p>Here is the list of rules I came up with to groom untagged, development, staging, and production images:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Remove untagged images over 90 days old</li> 
<li>Remove development tagged images over 90 days old</li> 
<li>Remove staging tagged images over 180 days old</li> 
<li>Remove production tagged images over 1 year old</li> 
</ul> 
<p>As you can see, the new Amazon ECR lifecycle policies are powerful, and help you easily keep the images you need, while cleaning out images you may never use again. This feature is available starting today, in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">regions where Amazon ECR is available</a>, at no extra charge. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/LifecyclePolicies.html">Amazon ECR Lifecycle Policies</a> in the AWS&nbsp;technical documentation.</p>

<p>(This post has been written by Chris Tate, SDE on the Lambda Console team)</p> 
<p>Today, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> released three console enhancements:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A quicker creation flow that lets you quickly create a function with the minimum working configuration, so that you can start iterating faster.</li> 
<li>A streamlined configuration page with Lambda function settings logically grouped into cards, which makes locating and making changes much easier.</li> 
<li>Persisting multiple events to help test your function.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>This post focuses on persisting test events, and I discuss how I’ve been using this new feature. Now when you are testing on the Lambda console, you can save up to 10 test events per function, and each event can be up to 6 megabytes in size, the maximum payload size for synchronous invocations. The events are saved for the logged-in user, so that two different users in the same account have their own set of events.</p> 
<b>Testing Lambda functions</b> 
<p>As a Lambda console developer, when I work on side projects at home, I sometimes use our development server. I’ve been using this new feature to test a Lambda function in one of my projects. The function is probably more complicated than it should be, because it can be triggered by an Alexa skill, Amazon CloudWatch schedule, or an Amazon API Gateway API. If you have had a similarly complicated function, you may have run into the same problem I did: &nbsp;How do you test?</p> 
<p>For quick testing, I used the console but the console used to save only one test event at a time. To work around this, my solution was a text file with three different JSON events, one for each trigger. I would copy whatever event I needed into the Lambda console, tweak it, and choose Test. This would become particularly annoying when I wanted to quickly test all three.</p> 
<p>I also switch between my laptop and desktop depending on my mood. For that reason, I needed to make sure this text file with the events were shared in some way, as the console only locally saved one test event to the current browser. But now you don’t have to worry about any of that.</p> 
<b>Walkthrough</b> 
<p>In the Lambda console, go to the detail page of any function, and select <strong>Configure test events</strong> from the test events dropdown (the dropdown beside the orange test button). In the dialog box, you can manage 10 test events for your function. First, paste your Alexa trigger event in the dialog box and type an event name, such as AlexaTrigger.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/27/Picture2-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2930 size-full" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/27/Picture2-2.png" alt="" width="973" height="1066" /></a></p> 
<p>Choose <strong>Create</strong>. After it saves, you see AlexaTrigger in the Test list.</p> 
<p>When you open the dialog box again by choosing <strong>Configure test events</strong>, you are in edit mode.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/27/Picture1-3.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2931 size-full" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/27/Picture1-3.png" alt="" width="973" height="974" /></a></p> 
<p>To add another event, choose <strong>Create new test event</strong>. Now you can choose from a list of templates or any of your previously saved test events. This is very useful for a couple of reasons:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>First, when you want to slightly tweak one of your existing events and still keep the earlier version intact.</li> 
<li>Second, when you are not sure how to structure a particular event from an event source. You can use one of the sample event templates and tweak them to your needs. Skip it when you know what your event should be.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Paste in your CloudWatch schedule event, give it a name, and choose <strong>Create</strong>. Repeat for API Gateway.</p> 
<p>Now that you have three events saved, you can quickly switch between them and repeatedly test. Furthermore, if you’re on your desktop but you created the test events on your laptop, there’s no problem. You can still see all your events and you can switch back and forth seamlessly between different computers.</p> 
<b>Conclusion</b> 
<p>This feature should allow you to more easily test your Lambda functions through the console. If you have more suggestions, add a comment to this post or submit feedback through the console. We actually read the feedback, believe it!</p>

<p>When you use Amazon Relational Database Service (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon RDS</a>), depending on the logging levels on the RDS instances and the volume of transactions, you could generate a lot of log data. To ensure that everything is running smoothly, many customers search for log error patterns using different log aggregation and visualization systems, such as Amazon Elasticsearch Service, Splunk, or other tool of their choice. A module needs to periodically retrieve the RDS logs using the SDK, and then send them to Amazon S3. From there, you can stream them to your log aggregation tool.</p> 
<p>One option is writing an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda">AWS Lambda</a> function to retrieve the log files. However, because of the time that this function needs to execute, depending on the volume of log files retrieved and transferred, it is possible that Lambda could time out on many instances.&nbsp; Another approach is launching an Amazon EC2 instance that runs this job periodically. However, this would require you to run an EC2 instance continuously, not an optimal use of time or money.</p> 
<p>Using&nbsp;the new Amazon CloudWatch integration with Amazon EC2 Container Service (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs">Amazon ECS</a>), you&nbsp;can&nbsp;trigger this job to run in a container on an existing Amazon ECS cluster. Additionally, this would allow you to improve costs by running containers on a fleet of Spot Instances.</p> 
<p>In this post, I will show you how to use the new scheduled tasks (<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/scheduled_tasks.html">cron</a>) feature in Amazon ECS and launch tasks&nbsp;using CloudWatch events, while leveraging Spot Fleet to maximize availability and cost optimization for containerized workloads.</p> 
<p><span id="more-2947"></span></p> 
<b>Architecture</b> 
<p>The following diagram shows how the various components described schedule a task that retrieves log files from&nbsp;Amazon RDS database instances, and deposits the logs into an S3 bucket.</p> 
<p>Amazon ECS cluster container instances are using Spot Fleet, which is a perfect match for the workload that needs to run when it can. This improves cluster costs.</p> 
<p>The task definition defines which Docker image to retrieve from the Amazon&nbsp;EC2 Container Registry (Amazon ECR)&nbsp;repository and run on the Amazon ECS cluster.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2949" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/27/917_scheduledtasks-arch-1024x790.png" alt="" width="640" height="494" /></p> 
<p>The container image has Python code functions to make AWS API calls using boto3. It iterates over the RDS database instances, retrieves the logs, and deposits them in the S3 bucket. Many customers choose these logs to be delivered to their centralized log-store. CloudWatch Events defines the schedule for when the container task has to be launched.</p> 
<b>Walkthrough</b> 
<p>To provide the basic framework, we have built an AWS CloudFormation <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-ecs-scheduled-tasks/blob/master/cloudformation/ecs-spot-fleet.yaml">template</a> that creates the following resources:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Amazon ECR repository for storing the Docker image to be used in the task definition</li> 
<li>S3 bucket that holds the transferred logs</li> 
<li>Task definition, with image name and S3 bucket as environment variables provided via input parameter</li> 
<li>CloudWatch Events rule</li> 
<li>Amazon ECS cluster</li> 
<li>Amazon ECS container instances using Spot Fleet</li> 
<li>IAM roles required for the container instance profiles</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Before you begin</h3> 
<p>Ensure that <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">Git</a>, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/">Docker</a>, and the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html">AWS CLI</a> are installed on your computer.</p> 
<p>In your AWS account, instantiate one Amazon Aurora instance using the console. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Aurora.CreateInstance.html">Creating an Amazon Aurora DB Cluster</a>.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;FailedEntryCount&quot;: 0
}</code></pre> </li> 
</ol> 
<p>That’s it. The logs now run based on the defined schedule.</p> 
<p>To test this, open the Amazon ECS console, select the Amazon ECS cluster that you created, and then choose <b>Tasks, Run New Task</b>. Select the task definition created by the CloudFormation template, and the cluster should be selected automatically. As this runs, the S3 bucket should be populated with the RDS logs for the instance.</p> 
<b>Conclusion</b> 
<p>In this post, you’ve seen that the choices for workloads that need to run at a scheduled time include Lambda with CloudWatch events or EC2 with cron. However, sometimes the job could run outside of Lambda execution time limits or be not cost-effective for an EC2 instance.</p> 
<p>In such cases, you can schedule the tasks on an ECS cluster using CloudWatch rules. In addition, you can use a Spot Fleet cluster with Amazon ECS for cost-conscious workloads that do not have hard requirements on execution time or instance availability in the Spot Fleet. For more information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/powering-your-amazon-ecs-cluster-with-amazon-ec2-spot-instances/">Powering your Amazon ECS Cluster with Amazon EC2 Spot Instances and Scheduled Events</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, AWS introduced a new type of authorizer in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon API Gateway</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/09/amazon-api-gateway-now-supports-enhanced-request-authorizers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enhanced request authorizers</a>. Previously, custom authorizers received only the bearer token included in the request and the ARN of the API Gateway method being called. Enhanced request authorizers receive all of the headers, query string, and path parameters as well as the request context. This enables you to make more sophisticated authorization decisions based on parameters such as the client IP address, user agent, or a query string parameter alongside the client bearer token.</p> 
<h3>Enhanced request authorizer configuration</h3> 
<p>From the API Gateway console, you can declare a new enhanced request authorizer by selecting the <strong>Request</strong> option as the AWS Lambda event payload:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/27/Screen-Shot-2017-09-13-at-10.13.18-AM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2924 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/27/Screen-Shot-2017-09-13-at-10.13.18-AM-215x300.png" alt="Create enhanced request authorizer" width="215" height="300" /></a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Just like normal custom authorizers, API Gateway can cache the policy returned by your Lambda function. With enhanced request authorizers, however, you can also specify the values that form the unique key of a policy in the cache. For example, if your authorization decision is based on both the bearer token and the IP address of the client, both values should be part of the unique key in the policy cache. The identity source parameter lets you specify these values as <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/request-response-data-mappings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mapping expressions</a>:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The bearer token appears in the Authorization header</li> 
<li>The client IP address is stored in the sourceIp parameter of the request context.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/27/Screen-Shot-2017-09-13-at-1.54.04-PM.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2925 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/27/Screen-Shot-2017-09-13-at-1.54.04-PM-300x163.png" alt="Configure identity sources" width="300" height="163" /></a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Using enhanced request authorizers with Swagger</h3> 
<p>You can also define enhanced request authorizers in your Swagger (<a href="https://www.openapis.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open API</a>) definitions. In the following example, you can see that all of the options configured in the API Gateway console are available as custom extensions in the API definition. For example, the <i>identitySource</i> field is a comma-separated list of mapping expressions.</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-yaml">securityDefinitions:
IpAuthorizer:
type: &quot;apiKey&quot;
name: &quot;IpAuthorizer&quot;
in: &quot;header&quot;
x-amazon-apigateway-authtype: &quot;custom&quot;
x-amazon-apigateway-authorizer:
authorizerResultTtlInSeconds: 300
identitySource: &quot;method.request.header.Authorization, context.identity.sourceIp&quot;
authorizerUri: &quot;arn:aws:apigateway:us-east-1:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:XXXXXXXXXX:function:py-ip-authorizer/invocations&quot;
type: &quot;request&quot;
</code></pre> 
<p>After you have declared your authorizer in the security definitions section, you can use it in your API methods:</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-yaml">---
swagger: &quot;2.0&quot;
info:
title: &quot;request-authorizer-demo&quot;
basePath: &quot;/dev&quot;
paths:
/hello:
get:
security:
- IpAuthorizer: []
...
</code></pre> 
<h3>Enhanced request authorizer Lambda functions</h3> 
<p>Enhanced request authorizer <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lambda</a> functions receive an event object that is similar to proxy integrations. It contains all of the information about a request, excluding the body.</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-json">{
&quot;methodArn&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:execute-api:us-east-1:XXXXXXXXXX:xxxxxx/dev/GET/hello&quot;,
&quot;resource&quot;: &quot;/hello&quot;,
&quot;requestContext&quot;: {
&quot;resourceId&quot;: &quot;xxxx&quot;,
&quot;apiId&quot;: &quot;xxxxxxxxx&quot;,
&quot;resourcePath&quot;: &quot;/hello&quot;,
&quot;httpMethod&quot;: &quot;GET&quot;,
&quot;requestId&quot;: &quot;9e04ff18-98a6-11e7-9311-ef19ba18fc8a&quot;,
&quot;path&quot;: &quot;/dev/hello&quot;,
&quot;accountId&quot;: &quot;XXXXXXXXXXX&quot;,
&quot;identity&quot;: {
&quot;apiKey&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
&quot;sourceIp&quot;: &quot;58.240.196.186&quot;
},
&quot;stage&quot;: &quot;dev&quot;
},
&quot;queryStringParameters&quot;: {},
&quot;httpMethod&quot;: &quot;GET&quot;,
&quot;pathParameters&quot;: {},
&quot;headers&quot;: {
&quot;cache-control&quot;: &quot;no-cache&quot;,
&quot;x-amzn-ssl-client-hello&quot;: &quot;AQACJAMDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA…&quot;,
&quot;Accept-Encoding&quot;: &quot;gzip, deflate&quot;,
&quot;X-Forwarded-For&quot;: &quot;54.240.196.186, 54.182.214.90&quot;,
&quot;Accept&quot;: &quot;*/*&quot;,
&quot;User-Agent&quot;: &quot;PostmanRuntime/6.2.5&quot;,
&quot;Authorization&quot;: &quot;hello&quot;
},
&quot;stageVariables&quot;: {},
&quot;path&quot;: &quot;/hello&quot;,
&quot;type&quot;: &quot;REQUEST&quot;
}
</code></pre> 
<p>The following enhanced request authorizer snippet is written in Python and compares the source IP address against a list of valid IP addresses. The comments in the code explain what happens in each step.</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-python">...
VALID_IPS = [&quot;58.240.195.186&quot;, &quot;201.246.162.38&quot;]
def lambda_handler(event, context):
# Read the client’s bearer token.
jwtToken = event[&quot;headers&quot;][&quot;Authorization&quot;]
# Read the source IP address for the request form 
# for the API Gateway context object.
clientIp = event[&quot;requestContext&quot;][&quot;identity&quot;][&quot;sourceIp&quot;]
# Verify that the client IP address is allowed.
# If it’s not valid, raise an exception to make sure
# that API Gateway returns a 401 status code.
if clientIp not in VALID_IPS:
raise Exception('Unauthorized')
# Only allow hello users in!
if not validate_jwt(userId):
raise Exception('Unauthorized')
# Use the values from the event object to populate the 
# required parameters in the policy object.
policy = AuthPolicy(userId, event[&quot;requestContext&quot;][&quot;accountId&quot;])
policy.restApiId = event[&quot;requestContext&quot;][&quot;apiId&quot;]
policy.region = event[&quot;methodArn&quot;].split(&quot;:&quot;)[3]
policy.stage = event[&quot;requestContext&quot;][&quot;stage&quot;]
# Use the scopes from the bearer token to make a 
# decision on which methods to allow in the API.
policy.allowMethod(HttpVerb.GET, '/hello')
# Finally, build the policy.
authResponse = policy.build()
return authResponse
...
</code></pre> 
<h3>Conclusion</h3> 
<p>API Gateway customers build complex APIs, and authorization decisions often go beyond the simple properties in a JWT token. For example, users may be allowed to call the “list cars” endpoint but only with a specific subset of filter parameters. With enhanced request authorizers, you have access to all request parameters. You can centralize all of your application’s access control decisions in a Lambda function, making it easier to manage your application security.</p>

<p>Business continuity is important for building mission-critical workloads on AWS. As an AWS customer, you might define recovery point objectives (RPO) and recovery time objectives (RTO) for different tier applications in your business. After the RPO and RTO requirements are defined, it is up to your architects to determine how to meet those requirements.</p> 
<p>You probably store persistent data in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/">Amazon EBS</a> volumes, which live within a single Availability Zone. And, following best practices, you take snapshots of your EBS volumes to back up the data on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a>, which provides 11 9's of durability. If you are following these best practices, then you've probably recognized the need to manage the number of snapshots you keep for a particular EBS volume and delete older, unneeded snapshots. Doing this cleanup helps save on storage costs.</p> 
<p>Some customers also have policies stating that backups need to be stored a certain number of miles away as part of a disaster recovery (DR) plan. To meet these requirements, customers copy their EBS snapshots to the DR region. Then, the same snapshot management and cleanup has to also be done in the DR region.</p> 
<p>All of this snapshot management logic consists of different components. You would first tag your snapshots so you could manage them. Then, determine how many snapshots you currently have for a particular EBS volume and assess that value against a retention rule. If the number of snapshots was greater than your retention value, then you would clean up old snapshots. And finally, you might copy the latest snapshot to your DR region. All these steps are just an example of a simple snapshot management workflow. But how do you automate something like this in AWS? How do you do it without servers?</p> 
<p>One of the most powerful AWS services released in 2016 was <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch">Amazon CloudWatch Events</a>. It enables you to build event-driven IT automation, based on events happening within your AWS infrastructure. CloudWatch Events integrates with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda">AWS Lambda</a> to let you execute your custom code when one of those events occurs. However, the actions to take based on those events aren't always composed of a single Lambda function. Instead, your business logic may consist of multiple steps (like in the case of the example snapshot management flow described earlier). And you may want to run those steps in sequence or in parallel. You may also want to have retry logic or exception handling for each step.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/">AWS Step Functions</a> serves just this purpose―to help you coordinate your functions and microservices. Step Functions enables you to simplify your effort and pull the error handling, retry logic, and workflow logic out of your Lambda code. Step Functions integrates with Lambda to provide a mechanism for building complex serverless applications. Now, you can kick off a Step Functions state machine based on a CloudWatch event.</p> 
<p>In this post, I discuss how you can target Step Functions in a CloudWatch Events rule. This allows you to have event-driven snapshot management based on snapshot completion events firing in CloudWatch Event rules.</p> 
<p>As an example of what you could do with Step Functions and CloudWatch Events, we've developed a <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-step-functions-ebs-snapshot-mgmt">reference architecture</a> that performs management of your EBS snapshots.</p> 
<b id="toc_1">Automating EBS Snapshot Management with Step Functions</b> 
<p>This architecture assumes that you have already <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/TakeScheduledSnapshot.html">set up CloudWatch Events to create the snapshots on a schedule</a> or that you are using some other means of creating snapshots according to your needs.</p> 
<p>This architecture covers the pieces of the workflow that need to happen after a snapshot has been created.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>It <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-cloudwatch-events-for-ebs-snapshots/">creates a CloudWatch Events rule</a> to invoke a Step Functions state machine execution when an EBS snapshot is created.</li> 
<li>The state machine then tags the snapshot, cleans up the oldest snapshots if the number of snapshots is greater than the defined number to retain, and copies the snapshot to a DR region.</li> 
<li>When the DR region snapshot copy is completed, another state machine kicks off in the DR region. The new state machine has a similar flow and uses some of the same Lambda code to clean up the oldest snapshots that are greater than the defined number to retain.</li> 
<li>Also, both state machines demonstrate how you can use Step Functions to handle errors within your workflow. Any errors that are caught during execution result in the execution of a Lambda function that writes a message to an SNS topic. Therefore, if any errors occur, you can subscribe to the SNS topic and get notified.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The following is an architecture diagram of the reference architecture:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/05/Picture1_Arch.png"><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/05/Picture1_Arch.png" alt="" width="975" height="753" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2763" /></a></p> 
<b id="toc_2">Creating the Lambda functions and Step Functions state machines</b> 
<p>First, pull the code from GitHub and use the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli">AWS CLI</a> to create S3 buckets for the Lambda code in the primary and DR regions. For this example, assume that the primary region is us-west-2 and the DR region is us-east-2. Run the following commands, replacing the italicized text in &lt;&gt; with your own unique bucket names.</p> 
<pre><code class="language-none">git clone https://github.com/awslabs/aws-step-functions-ebs-snapshot-mgmt.git
cd aws-step-functions-ebs-snapshot-mgmt/
aws s3 mb s3://<i>&lt;primary region bucket name&gt;</i> --region us-west-2
aws s3 mb s3://<i>&lt;DR region bucket name&gt;</i> --region us-east-2</code></pre> 
<p>Next, use the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model">Serverless Application Model</a> (SAM), which uses AWS CloudFormation to deploy the Lambda functions and Step Functions state machines in the primary and DR regions. Replace the italicized text in &lt;&gt; with the S3 bucket names that you created earlier.</p> 
<pre><code class="language-none">aws cloudformation package --template-file PrimaryRegionTemplate.yaml --s3-bucket <i>&lt;primary region bucket name&gt;</i>  --output-template-file tempPrimary.yaml --region us-west-2
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file tempPrimary.yaml --stack-name ebsSnapshotMgmtPrimary --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --region us-west-2
aws cloudformation package --template-file DR_RegionTemplate.yaml --s3-bucket <i>&lt;DR region bucket name&gt;</i> --output-template-file tempDR.yaml  --region us-east-2
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file tempDR.yaml --stack-name ebsSnapshotMgmtDR --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --region us-east-2</code></pre> 
<b id="toc_3">CloudWatch event rule verification</b> 
<p>The CloudFormation templates deploy the following resources:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The Lambda functions that are coordinated by Step Functions</li> 
<li>The Step Functions state machine</li> 
<li>The SNS topic</li> 
<li>The CloudWatch Events rules that trigger the state machine execution</li> 
</ul> 
<p>So, all of the CloudWatch event rules have been created for you by performing the preceding commands. The next section demonstrates how you could create the CloudWatch event rule manually. To jump straight to testing the workflow, see the “Testing in your Account” section. Otherwise, you begin by setting up the CloudWatch event rule in the primary region for the createSnapshot event and also the CloudWatch event rule in the DR region for the copySnapshot command.</p> 
<p>First, open the CloudWatch console in the primary region.</p> 
<p>Choose <strong>Create Rule</strong> and create a rule for the createSnapshot command, with your newly created Step Function state machine as the target.</p> 
<p>For <strong>Event Source</strong>, choose <strong>Event Pattern</strong> and specify the following values:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Service Name</strong>: EC2</li> 
<li><strong>Event Type</strong>: EBS Snapshot Notification</li> 
<li><strong>Specific Event</strong>: createSnapshot</li> 
</ul> 
<p>For <strong>Target</strong>, choose <strong>Step Functions state machine</strong>, then choose the state machine created by the CloudFormation commands. Choose <strong>Create a new role for this specific resource</strong>. Your completed rule should look like the following:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/05/Picture2_CWE_Rule.png"><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/05/Picture2_CWE_Rule.png" alt="" width="975" height="772" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2764" /></a></p> 
<p>Choose <strong>Configure Details</strong> and give the rule a name and description.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/05/Picture3_CWE_Rule_config.png"><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/05/Picture3_CWE_Rule_config.png" alt="" width="975" height="310" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2765" /></a></p> 
<p>Choose <strong>Create Rule</strong>. You now have a CloudWatch Events rule that triggers a Step Functions state machine execution when the EBS snapshot creation is complete.</p> 
<p>Now, set up the CloudWatch Events rule in the DR region as well. This looks almost same, but is based off the copySnapshot event instead of createSnapshot.</p> 
<p>In the upper right corner in the console, switch to your DR region. Choose <strong>CloudWatch</strong>, <strong>Create Rule</strong>.</p> 
<p>For <strong>Event Source</strong>, choose <strong>Event Pattern</strong> and specify the following values:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Service Name</strong>: EC2</li> 
<li><strong>Event Type</strong>: EBS Snapshot Notification</li> 
<li><strong>Specific Event</strong>: copySnapshot</li> 
</ul> 
<p>For <strong>Target</strong>, choose <strong>Step Functions state machine</strong>, then select the state machine created by the CloudFormation commands. Choose <strong>Create a new role for this specific resource</strong>. Your completed rule should look like in the following:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/05/Picture4_CWE_Target.png"><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/05/Picture4_CWE_Target.png" alt="" width="975" height="649" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2766" /></a></p> 
<p>As in the primary region, choose <strong>Configure Details</strong> and then give this rule a name and description. Complete the creation of the rule.</p> 
<b id="toc_4">Testing in your account</b> 
<p>To test this setup, open the EC2 console and choose <strong>Volumes</strong>. Select a volume to snapshot. Choose <strong>Actions</strong>, <strong>Create Snapshot</strong>, and then create a snapshot.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/05/Picture5_EBS_Snapshot.png"><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/05/Picture5_EBS_Snapshot.png" alt="" width="589" height="264" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2767" /></a></p> 
<p>This results in a new execution of your state machine in the primary and DR regions. You can view these executions by going to the Step Functions console and selecting your state machine.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/05/Picture6_Steps.png"><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/05/Picture6_Steps.png" alt="" width="975" height="191" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2768" /></a></p> 
<p>From there, you can see the execution of the state machine.</p> 
<p>Primary region state machine:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/05/Picture7_Steps_Execute.png"><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/05/Picture7_Steps_Execute.png" alt="" width="975" height="420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2769" /></a></p> 
<p>DR region state machine:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/05/Picture8_Steps_Execute_DR.png"><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/05/Picture8_Steps_Execute_DR.png" alt="" width="975" height="499" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2770" /></a></p> 
<p>I've also provided CloudFormation templates that perform all the earlier setup without using git clone and running the CloudFormation commands. Choose the <strong>Launch Stack</strong> buttons below to launch the primary and DR region stacks in Dublin and Ohio, respectively. From there, you can pick up at the Testing in Your Account section above to finish the example. All of the code for this example architecture is located in the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-step-functions-ebs-snapshot-mgmt">aws-step-functions-ebs-snapshot-mgmt</a> AWSLabs repo.</p>

<b id="toc_5">Summary</b> 
<p>This reference architecture is just an example of how you can use Step Functions and CloudWatch Events to build event-driven IT automation. The possibilities are endless:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Use this pattern to perform other common cleanup type jobs such as managing Amazon RDS snapshots, old versions of Lambda functions, or old Amazon ECR images—all triggered by scheduled events.</li> 
<li>Use Trusted Advisor events to identify unused EC2 instances or EBS volumes, then coordinate actions on them, such as alerting owners, stopping, or snapshotting.</li>

<p>Are you interested in reducing the operational overhead of your AWS Cloud infrastructure? One way to achieve this is to automate the response to operational events for resources in your AWS account.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-cloudwatch-events-track-and-respond-to-changes-to-your-aws-resources/">Amazon CloudWatch Events</a> provides a near real-time stream of system events that describe the changes and notifications for your AWS resources. From this stream, you can create rules to route specific events to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/">AWS Step Functions</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>, and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/WhatIsCloudWatchEvents.html">other AWS services</a> for further processing and automated actions.</p> 
<p>In this post, learn how you can use Step Functions to orchestrate <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/">serverless</a> IT automation workflows in response to CloudWatch events sourced from <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/what-is-aws-health.html">AWS Health</a>, a service that monitors and generates events for your AWS resources. As a real-world example, I show automating the response to a scenario where an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/">IAM</a> user <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys">access key</a> has been exposed.</p> 
<b id="toc_0">Serverless workflows with Step Functions and Lambda</b> 
<p>Step Functions makes it easy to develop and orchestrate components of operational response automation using visual workflows. Building automation workflows from individual Lambda functions that perform discrete tasks lets you develop, test, and modify the components of your workflow quickly and seamlessly. As serverless services, Step Functions and Lambda also provide the benefits of more productive development, reduced operational overhead, and no costs incurred outside of when the workflows are actively executing.</p> 
<b id="toc_1">Example workflow</b> 
<p>As an example, this post focuses on automating the response to an event generated by AWS Health when an IAM access key has been publicly exposed on GitHub. This is a diagram of the automation workflow:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/12/CWEArch.png"><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/12/CWEArch.png" alt="" width="975" height="515" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2837" /></a></p> 
<p>AWS proactively monitors popular code repository sites for IAM access keys that have been publicly exposed. Upon detection of an exposed IAM access key, AWS Health generates an AWS_RISK_CREDENTIALS_EXPOSED event in the AWS account related to the exposed key. A configured CloudWatch Events rule detects this event and invokes a Step Functions state machine. The state machine then orchestrates the automated workflow that deletes the exposed IAM access key, summarizes the recent API activity for the exposed key, and sends the summary message to an Amazon SNS topic to notify the subscribers―in that order.</p> 
<p>The corresponding Step Functions state machine diagram of this automation workflow can be seen below:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/12/CWEStateMachine.png"><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/09/12/CWEStateMachine.png" alt="" width="513" height="509" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2838" /></a></p> 
<p>While this particular example focuses on IT automation workflows in response to the AWS_RISK_CREDENTIALS_EXPOSEDevent sourced from AWS Health, it can be generalized to integrate with other events from these services, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/EventTypes.html">other event-generating AWS services</a>, and even <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/ScheduledEvents.html">run on a time-based schedule</a>.</p> 
<b id="toc_2">Walkthrough</b> 
<p>To follow along, use the code and resources found in the <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-health-tools/tree/master/automated-actions/AWS_RISK_CREDENTIALS_EXPOSED">aws-health-tools</a> GitHub repo. The code and resources include an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation</a> template, in addition to instructions on how to use it.</p>

<p>The Step Functions state machine execution starts with the exposed keys event details in JSON, a sanitized example of which is provided below:</p> 
<pre><code class="language-json">{
&quot;version&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,
&quot;id&quot;: &quot;121345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012&quot;,

}
]
}
}</code></pre> 
<p>After it's invoked, the state machine execution proceeds as follows.</p> 
<b id="toc_3">Step 1: Delete the exposed IAM access key pair</b> 
<p>The first thing you want to do when you determine that an IAM access key has been exposed is to delete the key pair so that it can no longer be used to make API calls. This Step Functions <em>task</em> state deletes the exposed access key pair detailed in the incoming event, and retrieves the IAM user associated with the key to look up API activity for the user in the next step. The user name, access key, and other details about the event are passed to the next step as JSON.</p> 
<p>This state contains a powerful error-handling feature offered by Step Functions <em>task</em> states called a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-errors.html#amazon-states-language-fallback-states"><em>catch</em> configuration</a>. Catch configurations allow you to reroute and continue state machine invocation at new states depending on potential errors that occur in your <em>task</em> function. In this case, the <em>catch</em> configuration skips to Step 3. It immediately notifies your security team that errors were raised in the <em>task</em> function of this step (Step 1), when attempting to look up the corresponding IAM user for a key or delete the user's access key.</p> 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Step Functions also offers a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-errors.html#amazon-states-language-retrying-after-error"><em>retry</em> configuration</a> for when you would rather retry a <em>task</em> function that failed due to error, with the option to specify an increasing time interval between attempts and a maximum number of attempts.</p> 
<b id="toc_4">Step 2: Summarize recent API activity for key</b> 
<p>After you have deleted the access key pair, you'll want to have some immediate insight into whether it was used for malicious activity in your account. Another <em>task</em> state, this step uses <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/">AWS CloudTrail</a> to look up and summarize the most recent API activity for the IAM user associated with the exposed key. The summary is in the form of counts for each API call made and resource type and name affected. This summary information is then passed to the next step as JSON. This step requires information that you obtained in Step 1. Step Functions ensures the successful completion of Step 1 before moving to Step 2.</p> 
<b id="toc_5">Step 3: Notify security</b> 
<p>The summary information gathered in the last step can provide immediate insight into any malicious activity on your account made by the exposed key. To determine this and further secure your account if necessary, you must notify your security team with the gathered summary information.</p> 
<p>This final <em>task</em> state generates an email message providing in-depth detail about the event using the API activity summary, and publishes the message to an SNS topic subscribed to by the members of your security team.</p> 
<p>If the <em>catch</em> configuration of the <em>task</em> state in Step 1 was triggered, then the security notification email instead directs your security team to log in to the console and navigate to the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/getting-started-phd.html">Personal Health Dashboard</a> to view more details on the incident.</p> 
<b id="toc_6">Lessons learned</b> 
<p>When implementing this use case with Step Functions and Lambda, consider the following:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>One of the most important parts of implementing automation in response to operational events is to ensure visibility into the response and resolution actions is retained. Step Functions and Lambda enable you to orchestrate your granular response and resolution actions that provides direct visibility into the state of the automation workflow.</li> 
<li>This basic workflow currently executes these steps serially with a <em>catch</em> configuration for error handling. More sophisticated workflows can leverage the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-parallel-state.html">parallel execution</a>, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-choice-state.html">branching logic</a>, and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-wait-state.html">time delay</a> functionality provided by Step Functions.</li> 
<li>Catch and retry configurations for task states allow for orchestrating reliable workflows while maintaining the granularity of each Lambda function. Without leveraging a catch configuration in Step 1, you would have had to duplicate code from the function in Step 3 to ensure that your security team was notified on failure to delete the access key.</li> 
<li>Step Functions and Lambda are serverless services, so there is no cost for these services when they are not running. Because this IT automation workflow only runs when an IAM access key is exposed for this account (which is hopefully rare!), the total monthly cost for this workflow is essentially $0.</li> 
</ul> 
<b id="toc_7">Conclusion</b> 
<p>Automating the response to operational events for resources in your AWS account can free up the valuable time of your engineers. Step Functions and Lambda enable granular IT automation workflows to achieve this result while gaining direct visibility into the orchestration and state of the automation.</p>
