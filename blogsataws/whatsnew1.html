<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 8, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon CloudWatch today announces KMS support for CloudWatch Logs. You can now encrypt your logs using keys managed through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">AWS Key Management Service</a> (KMS) and customer master key (CMK).<br /> </p> 
<p>Encryption is enabled at the log group level, by associating a CMK with a log group, either when you create the log group or after it exists. After you associate a CMK with a log group, all newly ingested data for the log group is encrypted using the CMK. This data is stored in encrypted format throughout its retention period. CloudWatch Logs decrypts this data upon request. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>KMS support for CloudWatch Logs is available in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS Public Regions</a>. For more information, see documentation.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 8, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and AWS Fargate are now included in the Amazon Compute Service Level Agreement (SLA) for 99.99% uptime and availability.</p> 
<p>Previously, the Amazon Compute SLA only covered availability and uptime for the Amazon EC2 instances used to run containers.</p> 
<p>Now, tasks run by Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate&nbsp;are covered by the Amazon Compute SLA with a 99.99% commitment for uptime and availability of the service. In the event this commitment is not met, you will be eligible to receive a service credit.</p> 
<p>To learn more, visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/sla/">Amazon Compute SLA</a>. Visit our product pages to learn more about <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">Amazon ECS</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">AWS Fargate</a>.</p> 
<p>Amazon ECS is available in US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), EU (Frankfurt), EU (Ireland), EU (London), and China (Beijing) regions.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 8, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>We are excited to announce that Amazon CloudWatch Alarms now supports alarming when any M out of N datapoints cross the alarm threshold. A datapoint is the value of a metric for a given metric aggregation period i.e. if you use one minute as an aggregation period for a metric, then there will be one datapoint every minute. With this launch, you can now create a CloudWatch alarm that alerts you when M out of N datapoints of a metric are above your predefined threshold, such as three out of five times in any given five minutes interval or two out of six times in a thirty minutes interval. When any M out of N datapoints are below your threshold in an interval, the alarm will be in OK state. Please note that the M datapoints out of N datapoints in an interval can be of any order and does not need to be consecutive. Consequently, you can now get alerted even when the spikes in your metrics are intermittent over an interval.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This feature gives you the flexibility to configure CloudWatch alarms in ways that fit your use cases. You can create alarms that alerts you even if one datapoint is above your threshold or only when all the datapoints in an interval have breached the threshold or any configuration between those use cases. To create alarms with this feature, please visit Amazon CloudWatch console. The PutMetricAlarm API has also been updated with a new a parameter, DatapointsToAlarm, that defines the number of datapoints that must be breaching to trigger the alarm. There is no additional cost to use this feature.</p> 
<p>This feature is available in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS Public Regions</a> and AWS GovCloud (US) region. To know more about CloudWatch Alarms, please visit <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<b id="Announcing_AWS_Single_Sign-On_(SSO)"> <a name="Announcing_AWS_Single_Sign-On_(SSO)"> Announcing AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 7, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) is a cloud SSO service that makes it easy to centrally manage SSO access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications. It enables users to sign in to a user portal with their existing corporate credentials and access all of their assigned accounts and applications from one place.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With AWS SSO, you can easily manage SSO access and user permissions to all of your accounts in AWS Organizations centrally. Further, by using the AWS SSO application configuration wizard, you can create Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 integrations and extend SSO access to any of your SAML-enabled applications. AWS SSO also includes built-in SAML integrations to many business applications, such as Salesforce, Box, and Office 365. With just a few clicks, you can enable a highly available SSO service without the upfront investment and on-going maintenance costs of operating your own SSO infrastructure.</p> 
<p>There is no additional cost to enable AWS SSO. It is now available in the US East (N. Virginia) Region.</p> 
<p>To learn more about AWS SSO, visit <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/">AWS Single Sign-On</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 7, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>We are pleased to announce Amazon Elasticsearch Service now allows you to encrypt your data using keys that you manage through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">AWS Key Management Service</a> (KMS). <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/what-is-elasticsearch/">Elasticsearch</a> is a popular open source search and analytics engine for log analytics, full text search, application monitoring, and more. Amazon Elasticsearch Service delivers Elasticsearch’s easy-to-use APIs and real-time capabilities along with the availability, scalability, and security required by production workloads.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On an Amazon Elasticsearch Service domain with encryption enabled, all data stored on the underlying file systems are encrypted, including primary and replica indices, log files, memory swap files, and automated Amazon S3 snapshots. Amazon Elasticsearch Service handles encryption and decryption seamlessly, so you don’t have to modify your application to access your data. You can choose to enable encryption when you create new domains via the AWS Management Console or API. Amazon Elasticsearch Service can create a KMS master key for you, or you can choose one of your own. Encryption at rest supports both Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) and instance storage. </p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 7, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>The AppStream 2.0 agent is software that runs on your streaming instances and enables application streaming. Before this, agent updates were included with new base image releases provided by AWS. To use the latest agent software with your streaming instances, you had to rebuild your images using new base images. Now, you can enable your images to always use the latest version of the AppStream 2.0 agent. Enabling automatic updates for the AppStream 2.0 agent helps ensure that your streaming instances always include the latest features, performance improvements, and security updates available from AWS.<br /> </p> 
<p>To enable automatic updates, create a new image from the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/base-image-version-history.html" target="_blank">December 7th 2017 base image</a>, or any base image created after this date. When you create a new image, the <b>Always use latest agent version</b>&nbsp;option is selected by default. When this option is selected, any new image builder or fleet instance that is launched from your image will always use the latest AppStream 2.0 agent version. You can only enable automatic updates for the AppStream 2.0 agent when you first create an image from the image builder. If you deselect this option, your image will use the agent version you selected when you launched the image builder. To learn more, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/agent-software-versions.html" target="_blank">Amazon AppStream 2.0 Agent Version History</a>.</p>

<b id="Elasticsearch_6.0_now_available_on_Amazon_Elasticsearch_Service"> <a name="Elasticsearch_6.0_now_available_on_Amazon_Elasticsearch_Service"> Elasticsearch 6.0 now available on Amazon Elasticsearch Service</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 6, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Elasticsearch 6.0 and Kibana 6.0 on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/">Amazon Elasticsearch Service</a>. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/what-is-elasticsearch/">Elasticsearch</a> is a popular open source analytics and search engine for log analytics, full text search, application monitoring, and more. Amazon Elasticsearch Service delivers Elasticsearch’s easy-to-use APIs and real-time capabilities along with the availability, scalability, and security required by production workloads.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When creating an Amazon Elasticsearch Service domain, you can now select Elasticsearch version 6.0. All Amazon Elasticsearch Service domains using Elasticsearch 6.0 are bundled with Kibana 6.0, the corresponding version of the open-source visualization tool. </p> 
<p>Elasticsearch 6.0 on Amazon Elasticsearch Service is powered by Apache Lucene 7.0.1 and offers several enhancements over the Elasticsearch 5.5 stack including:</p> 
<li><u>Improved efficiency of sparse fields:</u> Doc-values provide powerful columnar data store capabilities, but previously, Elasticsearch reserved a storage slot for every field in every column. With this release, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/minimize-index-storage-size-elasticsearch-6-0">sparsely populated fields</a> consume far less disk space and make more efficient use of file system caching.</li> 
<li><u>Reduced disk consumption:</u> The “_all” field made it easy to get started with Elasticsearch by concatenating all values together, but it created a huge amount of duplicate data. The “_all” field is <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-all-field.html">deprecated in Elasticsearch 6.0</a>, which can significantly reduce disk usage.</li> 
<li><u>Index sorting and faster query times:</u> You can now optimize Elasticsearch indexes to store documents on disk in a <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/index-sorting-elasticsearch-6-0">specific order</a>, which can allow queries to be returned more efficiently.&nbsp;</li> 
<li><u>Better query resource management:</u> A new control has been added to limit the maximum number of concurrent shard requests that can be served from a single search. This change intentionally slows down very broad searches and reduces their impact on other users.&nbsp;</li> 
<li><u>Kibana 6.0 accessibility improvements: </u>Colors throughout Kibana have been redesigned to have appropriate contrast settings for users with <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/making-kibana-accessible">color blindness</a>.&nbsp;</li> 
<li><u>New experimental Kibana query language (Kuery): </u>The default search feature in Kibana is a simple query string, which limits the application’s utility. Kuery is a new query language designed to <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/building-a-better-search-experience-in-kibana">simplify Kibana’s search experience</a> and provide a foundation for powerful new features like named functions and scripted fields.</li> 
<p>Elasticsearch 6.0 on Amazon Elasticsearch Service is now available in 14 regions globally: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), US West (N. California), Canada (Central), South America (Sao Paulo), EU (Ireland), EU (London), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), and Asia Pacific (Mumbai) regions.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 5, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>AWS is announcing three new enhancements that make it easier to get started with Amazon Inspector and to run security assessments. You can now automatically configure Inspector assessments through AWS CloudFormation as your Amazon EC2 instances are deployed. Next, you can now select an Amazon Linux Amazon Machine Image (AMI) pre-installed with the Inspector Agent and run security assessments without having to manually install the agent. Finally, Inspector now uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked roles, which means you can leave the registration and management of IAM roles for Inspector to us.</p> 
<p><b>AWS CloudFormation support:</b> Starting today, you can create Inspector resource groups, assessment targets, and assessment templates using CloudFormation templates. This allows you to automatically set up security assessments for your EC2 instances as they are deployed. In your CloudFormation template, you can also bootstrap installation of the Inspector Agent on EC2 instances by using <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_installing-uninstalling-agents.html">agent installation commands</a> in either <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-init.html">AWS::CloudFormation::Init</a> or <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html">EC2 user data</a>. Alternatively, you can create EC2 instances in your CloudFormation template using an AMI with the Inspector Agent pre-installed. For more information on CloudFormation, see AWS CloudFormation <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">website</a>.</p> 
<p><b>Amazon Linux AMI pre-installed with the Amazon Inspector Agent:</b> You can now choose to launch your EC2 instances using an Amazon Linux 2017.09 AMI that is pre-installed with the Inspector Agent. This AMI, now available from the EC2 Console and the AWS Marketplace, enables you to quickly deploy a fleet of EC2 instances that are ready to run Inspector assessments. The AMI comes pre-installed with the Inspector Agent and is provided and supported by Amazon Web Services at no additional charge. You can learn more about the AMI on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B077W1VR7G">AWS Marketplace</a>.</p> 
<p><b>Service-linked roles: </b>Amazon Inspector now uses IAM service-linked roles to describe EC2 instances and tags for an assessment target, so you no longer need to create and register IAM roles for Inspector. Starting today, a new service-linked role will be created for new customers when they start using Inspector, and for existing customers when they create a new assessment target or assessment template. The Inspector service-linked role is managed by us, so you don’t have to worry about inadvertently revoking permissions required by Inspector. In the future, when Inspector launches new features that require additional IAM permissions, we will update the Inspector service-linked role and notify you of the change. If and when you no longer want to use Inspector, you can delete the Inspector service-linked role via the IAM console. For more information on service-linked roles, see IAM <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 5, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>You can now harden your IoT applications by configuring a back-up action to perform in the event your primary rule action(s) fail. Amazon IoT Rules Engine also attaches the error information to the message payload affected. You can use this feature to ensure that message data is handled in context of the error or routed to a back-up resource. Error Actions may be used to handle a range of user and service error conditions such as insufficiently provisioned downstream services, or unavailability of services.</p> 
<p>Amazon IoT Rules Engine is a component of AWS IoT Core, a managed cloud service that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices. IoT Rules Engine evaluates inbound messages published into IoT Core and transforms and delivers them to another device or a cloud service, based on business rules you define. A rule can apply to data from one or many devices, can take one or many actions in parallel, and route messages to AWS endpoints including AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon S3, Amazon Machine Learning, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Cloud Watch, and Amazon Elastic Search Service with built-in Kibana integration. External endpoints can be reached using AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS).&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 5, 2017</span> </p> 
<p> Beginning today, you can use the Amazon Route 53 Auto Naming API to automate the registration of microservices in DNS. The new API simplifies the management of DNS names and health checks for microservices that run on top of AWS when microservices scale up and down.</p> 
<p> Previously, to keep track of the names and locations of microservice fleets that scale up and down in real time, you had two choices. Either you had to maintain custom scripts to directly control DNS records and health checks, or you had to deploy and manage third-party software. Amazon Route 53 Auto Naming abstracts away the complexity of managing DNS and health checks by providing a set of APIs for service naming configuration and service instance management.</p> 
<p> Now, when a new service instance is registered, you can access it by making a simple DNS query for the service name. Amazon Route 53 Auto Naming uses the multivalue answer routing type, which returns up to eight records in each response to a DNS query. If you defined a health check for the service, Amazon Route 53 returns only the records associated with healthy endpoints. You can also verify the health status of service instances via API.</p> 
<p>To learn more about Amazon Route 53 Auto Naming, please see our <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/overview-service-discovery.html">documentation</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/">product page</a>.</p>
