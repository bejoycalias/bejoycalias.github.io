<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 21, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Starting today, AWS Mobile adds first class support for Web and React Native, allowing JavaScript (JS) developers to easily develop cloud enabled apps. Previously, web and react native developers needed to manually configure services in the AWS console, download base SDKs, and read documentation just to start interacting with the platform. With today’s launch, JS developers can very easily configure core app features like user sign-in, storage and serverless APIs using the redesigned console and the new AWS Mobile CLI. <br /> </p> 
<p>With the redesigned console, a project now allows users to define four different app platforms for their backend. This means developers can configure backend features like User Sign-in once, and integrate it with an iOS, Android, Web, and React Native app, all through the console. Developers want to spend more time building quality apps, and less time wiring up their backends. To make this easier, we have introduced step-by-step wizards in our console, that walk the user through successfully integrating their app with an AWS backend. Additionally, we have also added higher order components (HOCs) in the Amplify library that lets users get started by writing 2-3 lines of code. For example, web app developers can add user sign-in UI to their app with 2 lines of code.<br /> </p> 
<p>For developers looking at starting new projects from scratch, starter kits provide fully functional apps that are already cloud enabled. With one click, you can create a starter project which will automatically configure backend resources for you and provide sample client code to have you up and running with a cloud app without writing a single line of code.<br /> </p> 
<p>We are also allowing developers to run performance tests on real devices for web apps hosted on Mobile Hub. Often, web-app developers only get the opportunity to run their apps on mobile emulators before releasing to the app stores. Now, with a single CLI command, developers can publish this web app to our fleet of iOS and Android devices in the AWS Device Farm for free. The web-app is run on a number of devices such as the iPhone 8 and Pixel 2 to gain real insights on app performance, with metrics such as time to first meaningful paint and time to first byte. Additionally, we provide screenshots of what the app looks like on different screen sizes and OS versions so developers can identify layout issues pre-release.<br /> </p> 
<p>To learn more about the enhancements, please log in to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/mobilehub" target="_blank">redesigned console</a>.</p> 
<p>AWS Mobile Hub enables you to select the region in which your project's resources will be created. For more information about AWS regions, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html" target="_blank">Regions and Endpoints</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 21, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Today we are releasing AWS Amplify, an Open Source library under Apache 2.0 for developers looking to build cloud connected applications with JavaScript on web or mobile platforms. AWS Amplify is designed to give a declarative interface to client developers looking to perform common actions using cloud services in a scalable and secure manner. These new capabilities allow developers writing JavaScript applications to programmatically apply best practices with common abstractions, ultimately resulting in faster development cycles. Along with the release of AWS Amplify, we are also releasing a comprehensive CLI experience which is fully integrated with AWS Mobile Hub. This CLI experience is designed for developers who are either building applications from scratch or enhancing existing projects with features for the AWS cloud.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The AWS Amplify library modules are broken down into categories (Auth, Analytics, Storage, APIs, Caching) to quickly add features such as User SignUp/SignIn, MFA, tracking or metric analytics, content management or Serverless API integration. The library also has internationalization and localization for multi-language support, as well as caching capabilities. Finally, there are components and extensions for React and React Native, allowing developers writing applications on those platforms to add these capabilities with framework specific standards. JavaScript developers can also use the library to build their own custom UI components, such as custom authentication flows. AWS Amplify is designed to be extended with different implementations among community and partner contributors.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation</a> now allows you to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stackinstances-override.html" target="_blank">override parameter</a> values by account and region in stack instances. Previously, you could only make changes to StackSets from your original CloudFormation templates. Now, you can override template parameter values when you first create the stack instances, and you can override parameter values for existing stack instances allowing you to specify and customize stack instances based on your requirements. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can use the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html" target="_blank">Parameters</a> section in your CloudFormation templates to input custom values into your templates each time you create or update your stack. CloudFormation has added a new type of parameter called <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types" target="_blank">SSM Parameter</a> that is provided by Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameters and stored in Parameters Store. You can specify a Systems Manager parameter key as the value of your template parameter. CloudFormation will get the value of the Systems Manager Parameter from Parameters Store and uses it to provision your stack. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>To learn more about CloudFormation support for Systems Manager Parameter Store or StackSets Parameter Overrides please visit AWS CloudFormation <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/cloudformation/">documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>AWS CloudFormation StackSets is available in the following regions: US East (Ohio), US EAST (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), EU (Frankfurt), EU (Ireland), EU (London), and South America (S&atilde;o Paulo).&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 21, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>You can now generate access logs in Amazon API Gateway. This is in addition to the detailed execution logs already provided by Amazon CloudWatch for API requests made to your APIs. The access logging feature lets you generate access logs in different formats such as CLF (Common Log Format), JSON, XML, and CSV. The access logs can be fed into your existing analytics or log processing tools so you can perform more in-depth analysis or take action in response to the log data.

<b id="Announcing_a_new_pricing_plan_for_AWS_IoT"> <a name="Announcing_a_new_pricing_plan_for_AWS_IoT"> Announcing a new pricing plan for AWS IoT</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 21, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>We are excited to announce a significant change to AWS IoT pricing that will go into effect January 1, 2018. Previously, AWS IoT charged for the use of connectivity, messaging, Device Shadow, Registry, and Rules Engine under a bundled pricing plan. The new plan unbundles pricing by charging for these components independently. This allows you to tailor costs around your specific workload, and ensures you only pay for what you use.</p> 
<p>The new pricing plan also delivers great value. You can connect a device to AWS IoT 24/7 for an entire year for as little as $0.042 (US East – N. Virginia region). In order to maintain connectivity, devices may send keep-alive (“Ping”) messages at frequencies ranging from 20 minutes to every 30s, and you do not incur any additional cost for these messages. Messaging prices, which previously were $5 per million messages, start at just $1 per million messages and go as low as $0.70 (US East – N. Virginia region). Messages are now metered in 5 kilobyte increments (up from 512 bytes), which means workloads that exchange large messages will be metered for fewer messages.

<b id="Lambda@Edge_Now_Supports_Content-Based_Dynamic_Origin_Selection,_Network_Calls_from_Viewer_Events,_and_Advanced_Response_Generation"> <a name="Lambda@Edge_Now_Supports_Content-Based_Dynamic_Origin_Selection,_Network_Calls_from_Viewer_Events,_and_Advanced_Response_Generation"> Lambda@Edge Now Supports Content-Based Dynamic Origin Selection, Network Calls from Viewer Events, and Advanced Response Generation</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 21, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Starting today, you can use three new capabilities with Lambda@Edge that can further help you build personalized content for your viewers while improving latency and simplifying your origin infrastructure. First, with content-based dynamic origin selection, you can route requests to different backend origin servers based on request attributes such as viewer location, viewer device type, HTTP headers, URL path, query string or cookies. Second, you can make remote network calls from Amazon CloudFront viewer-facing events. Third, you can generate binary data from your Lambda@Edge functions which lets you deliver richer, more customized content using Amazon CloudFront. We have also increased the limits for Lambda@Edge functions. You can choose up to 1536MB of memory, deploy larger packages up to 50MB, and implement Lambda@Edge functions with longer timeouts – up to 30 seconds. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Content-based dynamic origin selection:</b> Previously with Lambda@Edge, you could only forward requests to a pre-defined origin that you configured for your CloudFront distribution. Now you can front multiple backend origin application services with Amazon CloudFront and use Lambda@Edge to route requests to the appropriate origin dynamically, based on the attributes of the request. For example, you could have multiple microservices based backend origins that your Lambda@Edge functions can dynamically route to by inspecting request attributes like query strings, headers or cookies. Or you can route your viewers to the most optimal origin for latency or data locality if you happen to run geographically distributed applications in different AWS regions. Content-based dynamic origin selection also lets you simplify your origin infrastructure by moving request routing logic from a fleet of reverse proxy servers that you would have had to manage to serverless Lambda@Edge functions.<br /> <br /> <b>Network calls on viewer-facing events:</b> In addition to the remote network calls from origin-facing CloudFront events, Lambda@Edge now supports remote network calls from viewer-facing CloudFront events. For instance, you can now make remote calls to your authentication servers to verify user-privilege levels and serve premium vs. non-premium content based on what each user is authorized for.<br /> <br /> <b>Advanced response generation:</b> Now with support for binary responses (such as images) and higher Lambda function limits, you can move more complex logic to the edge than was possible previously. For example, with remote calls and binary response generation, you can now call services like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/">Amazon Rekognition</a> to find interesting portions of images and resize, crop or compress them, add image watermarking or manipulate the images for optimal viewing experience on various viewer devices. As a content publisher, you can dynamically assemble content for each viewer from multiple external sources, run compute-intensive logic, and generate customized responses. Lambda@Edge makes all of this possible at low latencies for your viewers, and without the need to provision or manage your own servers.</p> 
<p>There are no additional charges for using these new features. To learn more about Lambda@Edge, visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/">product page</a>. For more information on how to use these capabilities, please see the resources below: &nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/">Amazon Redshift</a> improves performance for repeat queries by caching the result and returning the cached result when queries are re-run.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Dashboard, visualization, and business intelligence (BI) tools that execute repeat queries will see a significant boost in performance due to result caching. In addition, result caching frees up resources to improve performance of all other queries.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When a query executes, Amazon Redshift searches the cache to see if there is a cached result from a prior run. If a cached result is found and the data has not changed, the cached result is returned immediately instead of re-running the query. If no cached result is available or if data has changed, the query is re-run and the new result is cached for future runs. When the cached result is returned, processing resources are conserved and made available for other queries.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With this release, we added a new ‘source_query’ column to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_SVL_QLOG.html" target="_blank">SVL_QLOG</a> view that shows if a query uses result caching. Result caching is enabled by default on all Amazon Redshift clusters. To learn more, visit our <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_enable_result_cache_for_session.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<b id="Amazon_Rekognition_announces_real-time_face_recognition,_Text_in_Image_recognition,_and_improved_face_detection"> <a name="Amazon_Rekognition_announces_real-time_face_recognition,_Text_in_Image_recognition,_and_improved_face_detection"> Amazon Rekognition announces real-time face recognition, Text in Image recognition, and improved face detection</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 21, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon Rekognition added three new features today: detection and recognition of text in images; real-time face recognition across tens of millions of faces; and detection of up to 100 faces in challenging crowded photos. Customers who are already using Amazon Rekognition for face verification and identification will experience up to a 10% accuracy improvement in most cases.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Text in Image: </b>Customers using Amazon Rekognition to detect objects and faces in images have been asking us to recognize text embedded in images, such as street signs and license plates captured by traffic cameras, news, and captions on TV screens, or stylized quotes overlaid on phone-captured family pictures. Starting today, you can use Rekognition Text in Image to recognize and extract textual content from images. Text in Image is specifically built to work with real-world images rather than document images. It supports text in most Latin scripts and numbers embedded in a large variety of layouts, fonts, and styles, and overlaid on background objects at various orientation as banners and posters.</p> 
<p>For example, in image sharing and social media applications, you can now enable visual search based on an index of images that contain the same keywords. In media and entertainment applications, you can catalogue videos based on relevant text on screen, such as ads, news, sport scores, and captions. Additionally, in security and safety applications, you can identify vehicles based on license plate numbers from images taken by street cameras. </p> 
<p>“As a visually-driven platform, Pinterest relies heavily on the speed and quality of images, but the text behind those images is just as important, as it provides context and makes Pins actionable for our 200M+ active Pinners. In working with Amazon Rekognition Text in Image, we can better extract the rich text captured in images at scale and with low latency for the millions of Pins stored in Amazon S3. We look forward to continuing to develop the partnership with AWS for high quality and fast experiences for Pinners and businesses on Pinterest.” - Vanja Josifovski, CTO, Pinterest</p> 
<p>“Professional photographers often use SmugMug to share and sell photos containing text, for example, the numbers on marathon race bibs. Amazon Rekognition Text in Image allows us to programmatically extract bib numbers at scale and provide event photographers with even more functionality to quickly and easily share and monetize photos from these events. &quot; - Don MacAskill, Co-founder, CEO &amp; Chief Geek at SmugMug<br /> &nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Face Search and Detection:</b> With Amazon Rekognition, you can now perform real-time face searches against collections with tens of millions of faces. This represents a 5-10X reduction in search latency, while simultaneously allowing for collections that can store 10-20X more faces than before.</p> 
<p>In security and safety applications, you can now identify people of interest against a collection of millions of faces in near real-time, enabling use cases such as timely and accurate crime prevention. The Washington County Sheriff’s Office is the primary first responder for 911 calls from the citizens in Oregon. The office also provides support for crime prevention to other city police departments countywide. The Sheriff’s Office had previously used Amazon Rekognition to reduce the identification time of suspects from 2-3 days down to minutes.</p> 
<p>“These improvements allow deputies in the field to receive the response to searches in near real time. This allows them to get the information they need and take action quickly. Seconds saved in the field can make the difference in saving a life.” Chris Adzima, Senior Information Systems Analyst for the Washington County Sheriff’s Office.</p> 
<p>Starting today, customers can also detect, analyze and index up to 100 faces (up from 15) in a single image. With this improvement, you can accurately capture demographics and analyze sentiments for all faces in group photos, crowded events and public locations such as airports and department stores. <br /> &nbsp;</p> 
<p>To get started with Text in Image, Face Search and Face Detection, download the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/developers/">latest SDK</a> or simply log in to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/" target="_blank">Amazon Rekognition Console</a> to try out this feature with the supplied sample images, or your own images.

<p>Starting today, you can now use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/shield/ddos-attack-protection/">AWS Shield Advanced</a> to get higher levels of protection for your applications running on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</a> or <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html">Network Load Balancer (NLB)</a> against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Simply enable AWS Shield Advanced on an <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html" target="_blank">AWS Elastic IP address</a> attached to an internet-facing EC2 instance or NLB. AWS Shield Advanced will automatically detect the type of AWS resource behind the Elastic IP address and apply the relevant DDoS protections.</p> 
<p>AWS Shield Advanced previously protected HTTP/TCP applications running on Amazon CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancing, and Amazon Route 53. For non-TCP based applications (for instance, UDP or SIP) that had to run on EC2 or NLB, AWS Shield Standard provided the protection against most common infrastructure layer DDoS attacks. Now, with AWS Shield Advanced on Elastic IP, you get the benefits of AWS Shield Advanced for internet-facing application running directly on EC2, including additional detection and mitigation against large and sophisticated DDoS attacks, near-real-time attack visibility, access to Amazon’s 24x7 DDoS Response Team (DRT), and economic protections against DDoS-related spikes in your EC2 or NLB charges. Working with DRT, you can define custom DDoS mitigation profiles for your applications to ensure optimal response to current or future attacks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With this release, AWS Shield Advanced customers also gain access to new, near-real time reports and CloudWatch metrics that provide deeper insight into DDoS attack vectors. For infrastructure layer attacks, you see which IPs, ASNs, or countries are the top sources of attack traffic. For application layer attacks, you can get visibility into top referrers, destination URLs and user-agents that sourced the attack. This allows you to craft effective mitigations in AWS WAF or seek DRT help in deploying custom mitigations. We have also updated the recently announced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/global-threat-environment-dashboard-view-ddos-attack-trends-across-aws/">global threat environment dashboard</a> to give you better awareness of the global DDoS environment, including attacks by region and the overall size and frequency of attacks across AWS.</p> 
<p>Prices for AWS Shield Advanced for EC2 and NLB are the same as those for Elastic Load Balancing. You pay a monthly fee of $3,000 per account, plus data transfer fees starting at $0.050 per GB. For details, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/shield/pricing/">https://aws.amazon.com/shield/pricing/</a>. AWS Shield Standard continues to provide automatic DDoS protections against common infrastructure layer attacks to all AWS customers, at no additional charge.&nbsp;AWS Shield Advanced can now protect your EC2 and NLB in the following AWS Regions - Northern Virginia, Oregon, Ireland, Tokyo, and Northern California.</p>

A typical application build process includes various phases, such as preparing environment, updating configuration, downloading dependencies, running unit tests, and packaging the built artifact. In most cases dependent files do not change frequently between builds allowing you to reduce your build time by caching dependencies with CodeBuild. To learn more, visit our blog <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/how-to-enable-caching-for-aws-codebuild/" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. CodeBuild is available in the US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), US West (San Francisco), Canada (Central), EU (London), EU (Ireland), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Singapore), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo).&nbsp;</p>

<b id="Now_enable_Kerberos_authentication_and_EMRFS_authorization_in_Amazon_EMR"> <a name="Now_enable_Kerberos_authentication_and_EMRFS_authorization_in_Amazon_EMR"> Now enable Kerberos authentication and EMRFS authorization in Amazon EMR</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 21, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>You can now enable authentication with <a href="https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/" target="_blank">Kerberos</a> and fine-grained EMRFS authorization for Amazon S3 access on your Amazon EMR clusters. You can use Kerberos to authenticate requests between services running on your cluster, user actions on your cluster, and external client requests from remote services. Amazon EMR will create a MIT KDC on the master node of your cluster, and utilize the open-source Kerberos authentication settings for certain application components on your cluster. Additionally, you can easily enable a cross-realm trust with a Microsoft Active Directory to seamlessly allow users in the directory to authenticate using Kerberos to access and run workloads on a cluster.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Additionally, you can now use EMRFS authorization to specify the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html" target="_blank">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role</a> to use when certain user accesses Amazon S3. Applications like Apache Spark and Apache Hive use <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-fs.html" target="_blank">EMRFS</a>, Amazon EMR’s connector for Amazon S3, for data access. By default, the policy attached to the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-iam-roles.html" target="_blank">EC2 role (instance profile)</a> on your cluster determines the data that can be accessed in Amazon S3. With EMRFS authorization, you can now specify the IAM role to assume when a user or group uses EMRFS to access Amazon S3. Choosing the IAM role for each user or group enables fine-grained access control for Amazon S3 on multi-user Amazon EMR clusters. Furthermore, you can specify the IAM role to use for different Amazon S3 buckets, which makes it easier to enable cross-account Amazon S3 access.</p> 
<p>To enable authentication with Kerberos and EMRFS authorization on your Amazon EMR cluster, specify these options in your security configuration and corresponding cluster configuration. You can <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-security-configurations.html" target="_blank">create a security configuration</a> on the security configuration page in Amazon EMR console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or the AWS SDK with the Amazon EMR API. If you are creating a cross-realm domain join with a Microsoft Active Directory, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-kerberos-cross-realm.html" target="_blank">please follow these additional steps</a>. Authentication with Kerberos and EMRFS authorization is available on Amazon EMR release 5.10.0 and later. Please visit the Amazon EMR documentation for more information about <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-kerberos.html" target="_blank">authentication with Kerberos</a>, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-emrfs-authz.html" target="_blank">EMRFS authorization</a>, and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-create-security-configuration.html" target="_blank">security configurations</a>.</p>

<b id="Introducing_the_AWS_Cost_Explorer_API"> <a name="Introducing_the_AWS_Cost_Explorer_API"> Introducing the AWS Cost Explorer API</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 20, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>AWS Cost Explorer helps you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. This is done via an intuitive interface that enables you to quickly create custom reports (including charts and tabular data) and analyses of your cost and usage data, both at a high level and for highly-specific requests. Starting today, you can directly access the Cost Explorer API, the low-latency ad-hoc query service that powers the Cost Explorer web application.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Cost Explorer API gives you programmatic access to the full Cost Explorer dataset, including advanced metrics (e.g., Reserved Instance utilization) and your cost allocation tags. To start, you can leverage the Cost Explorer API to break down your costs by grouping your data up to two levels. For example, you can return all of your Amazon EC2 Running Hours cost and usage data segmented by Instance Type and your “project” tag. Further, you can query for highly-specific data, such as all costs associated with Amazon EC2 Running Hours in the m4 instance family that are not tagged as “project: secretProject.” With the Cost Explorer API, you can now build interactive, performant cost management applications that suit your organization’s needs without having to set up or maintain any analytics infrastructure.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To get started using the Cost Explorer API, please access the&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-explorer-api.html" target="_blank">Using the Cost Explorer API</a> or refer to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/">Cost Explorer webpage</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 20, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>You can now call a lambda function in the SQL statement of your rule by calling it in the SELECT statement to enrich IoT message data with external services like weather, geo-location, and maps. You can also call a lambda function from the WHERE clause to evaluate a condition with context from external services. For example, you can evaluate if the reported device position lies inside or outside a geographic area by calling an external geo-fencing endpoint like HERE maps (<a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-iot-examples/tree/master/hereGeofencingRule" target="_blank">sample</a>) and then triggering an SNS Action if it lies outside the area.<br /> </p> 
<p>AWS IoT is a managed cloud service that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices. IoT Rules Engine, a component of AWS IoT, evaluates inbound messages published into AWS IoT and transforms and delivers them to another device or a cloud service, based on business rules you define. A rule can apply to data from one or many devices, can take one or many actions in parallel, and route messages to AWS endpoints including AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon S3, Amazon Machine Learning, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon CloudWatch, and Amazon Elasticsearch Service with built-in Kibana integration. External endpoints can be reached using AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS).<br /> </p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/">Amazon Redshift</a> introduces Short Query Acceleration to speed up execution of short running queries. Short Query Acceleration provides higher performance, faster results, and better predictability of query execution times.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Short running queries such as reports, dashboards, and interactive analysis can be delayed when entering a queue behind a long running query like an extract, transform, and load (ETL) operation. Short Query Acceleration uses machine learning to predict the execution time of a query and move short running queries to an express ‘short query’ queue for faster processing. The acceleration varies based on your workload, though we have observed 3x improvements in short query performance for internal workloads.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can enable SQA in three easy steps. Step one, edit your cluster parameter group, by going to your Workload Management (WLM) settings in your console and click on 'Edit'. Step two, choose Enable short query acceleration checkbox. Step three, 'Save' to enable SQA on your cluster. Alternatively, you can enable SQA using the AWS command line interface (CLI). To learn more, please refer to our <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/wlm-short-query-acceleration.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With the latest release, Amazon Redshift customers can now use Short Query Acceleration in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS Public Regions</a>.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 20, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>You can now generate SDKs for APIs in Ruby with Amazon API Gateway. This is in addition to API Gateway’s support for SDKs in Java, JavaScript, Android and iOS (Swift and Objective-C). The generated Ruby SDK reduces coding complexity for your API’s consumers and it helps them use coding best practices. Using the generated SDKs, your API consumers can automatically utilize already provided support for API keys management, custom or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication, automatic and configurable retries with exponential backoff and exception handling. The generated Ruby SDKs are compatible with Ruby 1.9 or later.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This feature is now available in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), US West (N. California), Canada (Central), South America (S&atilde;o Paulo), EU (Ireland), EU (Frankfurt), EU (London), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Seoul), and Asia Pacific (Mumbai) AWS regions.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 21, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>You can now receive Amazon CloudWatch Events when files that are written to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/details/">AWS Storage Gateway</a>’s file interface (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/file/">File Gateway</a>) are uploaded to Amazon S3. You can use these notifications to trigger in-cloud or on-premises automated workflows. For instance, a file upload notification could initiate an API call to start a data processing job using AWS analytics services, such as Amazon Athena, or invoke an AWS Lambda function for transcoding. Alternatively, you can use a file upload notification to make a RefreshCache API call to File Gateways in remote offices, so that on-premises applications can then read the uploaded data, such as reports, files for print presses, code updates or database backup files.</p> 
<p>Additionally, you can now have the File Gateway infer the MIME type of an uploaded document by filename. With this capability, web browsers accessing a file from Amazon S3, directly or via Amazon CloudFront, can display it in its native file format, for instance, as a PDF or an image, instead of downloading it.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Other new features include support for SUSE Linux Enterprise clients, forced deletion of file shares, and end-to-end performance improvements.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>All of the features noted above are supported in every region AWS Storage Gateway is available today for newly created File Gateways. A software update for existing gateways will be made generally available on December 4, 2017. To request an earlier update, please <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">contact AWS support</a>.</p> 
<p>AWS Storage Gateway's file interface, the File Gateway, offers you a seamless way to connect local applications to Amazon S3 cloud storage in order to store files as durable objects. File Gateway provides an NFS mount for Amazon S3, with caching for low-latency local access.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starting today, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/">Amazon Redshift</a> improves query performance by automatically moving read and write queries to the next matching queue without restarting the moved queries. This enhancement to Workload Management enables more efficient use of resources to improve query performance.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With this update, customers can now hop <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_CREATE_TABLE_AS.html">Create Table as</a> style write queries to manage extract, transform, and load (ETL) batch processes. This new feature can route long-running read and write queries to a separate queue to increase performance of queries running in the original queue. In addition, timed-out queries can automatically hop to another queue and continue processing without requiring a query restart. Intermediate results are preserved, so there is minimal effect on total execution time for hopped queries. </p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 17, 2017</span> </p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dms/">AWS Database Migration Service</a> (DMS) offers two new ways to validate your database migration: pre-migration validation and post-migration data validation.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Pre-migration validation checks your migration task setting prior to launch, and alerts you to potential issues. For example, it may find that you’re trying to migrate an unsupported data type. Read more about this feature <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/migration-validation-part-1-introducing-migration-assessment-in-aws-database-migration-service/">here</a>.</p> 
<p>Post-migration data validation verifies that all data selected for migration was successfully migrated. This form of validation may prevent operational or compliance failures. Post-migration data validation is available for both full load and on-going replication phases in a migration. Read more about this feature <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/migration-validation-part-2-introducing-data-validation-in-aws-data-migration-service/">here</a>.</p> 
<p>Both types of validation are available through the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/dms/home">AWS DMS console</a> and the API. Please visit the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/dms/">DMS product page</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/dms/">documentation</a> for more information, and see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dms/pricing/">AWS DMS Pricing</a> for regional availability.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 17, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Starting today you can easily restore a new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/">Amazon RDS for MySQL</a> database instance from a backup of your existing MySQL database, including MySQL databases running on Amazon EC2 or outside of AWS. This is done by creating a backup using the <a href="https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-xtrabackup" target="_blank">Percona XtraBackup tool</a> and uploading the resulting files to an Amazon S3 bucket. You then create a new Amazon RDS DB Instance from the backup files in Amazon S3, directly through the RDS Console or AWS Command Line Interface.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This feature makes it considerably easier and faster to migrate large MySQL databases with complex schemas to Amazon RDS. It has no performance impact on your source database and you can keep writing to your database during the backup process, minimizing downtime during migration. You can make use of Amazon S3 file transfer optimizations including Multipart Upload and Transfer Acceleration for quickly uploading large backup files. Once created, you can use MySQL replication to catch your Amazon RDS database up to changes in the source database.</p> 
<p>This feature is available in all AWS Commercial regions for databases using MySQL version 5.6. Please refer to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.Migrate.Backup.html">Amazon RDS documentation</a> to learn more about this feature.&nbsp;</p>

You can easily get started by pointing Amazon Athena to the S3 Inventory report in ORC or CSV format with a few clicks, run ad hoc queries, and get results in seconds. This is available in all AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">Regions</a> where Athena is available. Learn more by visiting our <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-inventory.html#storage-inventory-athena-query">developer guide</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Customers can now get S3 Inventory in Apache <a href="https://orc.apache.org/">Optimized Row Columnar</a> (ORC) file format. ORC is a self-describing, type-aware columnar file format designed for Hadoop ecosystem workloads. The columnar format lets the reader read, decompress, and process only the columns that are required for the current query. For querying S3 Inventory with Athena, we recommend configuring your inventory for ORC instead of CSV for faster query performance and lower query cost. ORC format for S3 Inventory is available in all AWS Regions. Get started by visiting the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3">S3 Console</a>. &nbsp;</p> 
<b id="Amazon_Aurora_now_supports_Auto_Scaling_for_Aurora_Replicas"> <a name="Amazon_Aurora_now_supports_Auto_Scaling_for_Aurora_Replicas"> Amazon Aurora now supports Auto Scaling for Aurora Replicas</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 17, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Starting today, you can use Aurora Auto Scaling to automatically add or remove Aurora Replicas in response to changes in performance metrics specified by you. Aurora Replicas share the same underlying volume as the primary instance and are well suited for read scaling. With Aurora Auto Scaling, you can specify a desired value for predefined metrics of your Aurora Replicas such as average CPU utilization or average active connections. You can also create a custom metric for Aurora Replicas to use it with Aurora Auto Scaling. Aurora Auto Scaling adjusts the number of Aurora Replicas to keep the selected metric closest to the value specified by you. For example, an increase in traffic could cause the average CPU utilization of your Aurora Replicas to go up and beyond your specified value. New Aurora Replicas are automatically added by Aurora Auto Scaling to support this increased traffic. Similarly, when CPU utilization goes below your set value, Aurora Replicas are terminated so that you don't pay for unused DB instances.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Aurora Auto Scaling works with Amazon CloudWatch to continuously monitor performance metrics of your Aurora Replicas. You can create an Aurora Auto Scaling policy for any of your existing or new MySQL-compatible Aurora DB clusters. To get started, visit the <a href="https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?skin=new#dbclusters:">AWS Management Console</a> and create an Aurora Auto Scaling policy with just a few clicks. Alternatively, download the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/">latest CLI or SDKs</a> to create Aurora Auto Scaling policies programmatically. Refer our <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Aurora.Integrating.AutoScaling.html">documentation</a> for more information.</p> 
<p>There is no additional cost to use Aurora Auto Scaling beyond what you already pay for Aurora and CloudWatch alarms. &nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet.html" target="_blank">Spot Fleet</a> now supports a new type of scaling policy called target tracking scaling policies that you can use to set up dynamic scaling for your application in just a few simple steps. Adding Auto Scaling to your Spot Fleet is one way to maximize the benefits of AWS. Auto Scaling helps you build systems that respond to changes in demand by automatically launching or terminating Amazon EC2 instances based on conditions that you define. This dynamic scaling helps to improve application availability and reduce costs. For example, you can use Auto Scaling to automatically launch EC2 instances for your Spot Fleet when demand increases to help maintain performance, and terminate instances when demand drops to save money.</p> 
<p>With target tracking, you select a load metric for your application, such as “Average CPU Utilization” or the new “Request Count Per Target” metric from Application Load Balancer, set the target value, and Auto Scaling adjusts the target capacity in your Spot Fleet as needed to maintain that target. It acts like a home thermostat, automatically adjusting the system to keep the environment at your desired temperature. For example, you can configure target tracking to keep CPU utilization for your fleet of web servers at 50%. From there, Auto Scaling launches or terminates Spot capacity as required to keep the average CPU utilization at 50%. Auto Scaling is available at no additional charge. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Also starting today, you can now use the new&nbsp;<a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/AwsSpotFleetBambooPlugin.AwsSpotFleetBambooPlugin/server/overview">Amazon EC2 Spot Atlassian Bamboo plug-in</a>&nbsp;to help you save up to 90% off your Atlassian Bamboo infrastructure costs, compared to when running them using On-Demand EC2 instances. This plug-in makes it easier to save money with&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">EC2 Spot instances</a>, by allowing you to configure Bamboo to automatically scale a fleet of Spot instances up or down depending on the number jobs to be completed.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 16, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) introduces two new features that can help to protect your sender reputation: email pausing and configuration set reputation metrics.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This release includes API operations that allow you to temporarily pause email sending for a specific configuration set, or across your entire Amazon SES account. You can use this feature to automatically pause email sending when your reputation metrics cross certain thresholds that you define. </p> 
<p>For example, if the complaint rate for emails sent using a configuration set exceeds 0.25%, you can prevent other emails that use that configuration set from being sent. For more information, see Automatically Pausing Email Sending to CloudWatch in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.</p> 
<p>This release also includes the ability to view reputation metrics for individual configuration sets. Amazon SES already publishes metrics related to the bounce and complaint rates for your entire Amazon SES account to Amazon CloudWatch. You can use these metrics to track historical trends, and to create alarms. </p> 
<p>With today's update, you can also send metrics that are specific to emails sent using individual configuration sets. This additional layer of information will help you better understand and respond to changes. For more information, see Exporting Reputation Metrics for a Configuration Set to CloudWatch in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/releasenotes/release-amazon-simple-email-service-on-2017-11-15/">Amazon SES Developer Guide</a> and read the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ses/protect-your-reputation-with-email-pausing-and-configuration-set-metrics/">blog post</a>.</p> 
<p>These features are now available in the following AWS Regions: US West (Oregon), US East (N. Virginia), and EU (Ireland).&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 16, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Beginning today, you can use the Amazon Route 53 API to view your current limits on Route 53 resources such as hosted zones and health checks. The same APIs also return how many of each resource you're currently using. This lets you see how close you are to reaching a service limit at any time. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, you had to manually keep track of your usage and remember your limits—either the default limit or a custom limit if you previously requested a limit increase. Otherwise, you might reach the limit and be unable to create more resources.</p> 
<p>With today’s release, you can watch your usage and compare it against your current limits, so you can request increases well in advance of reaching a limit.</p> 
<p>You can view your limits and current usage for the following Route 53 resources:</p> 
<li>Hosted zones</li> 
<li>Health checks</li> 
<li>Reusable delegation sets</li> 
<li>Traffic policies</li> 
<li>Traffic policy instances</li> 
<p>Additionally, some types of Route 53 resources enforce limits on a per-resource basis. You can view the limits and current usage for the following Route 53 resources:</p> 
<li> Resource record sets per hosted zone</li> 
<li>Associated Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (Amazon VPCs) per private hosted zone</li> 
<li>Hosted zones per reusable delegation set</li> 
<p>To learn more about Amazon Route 53 and its associated service limits, please read the ‘Limits’ section in the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DNSLimitations.html">Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 16, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>You can now locally test and debug your deployment through the updated AWS CodeDeploy agent. The updated agent is a software package that, when installed on an instance, enables the instance to be used in CodeDeploy deployments and provides a command line interface for troubleshooting.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, if you wanted to test and debug your deployment, you had to fully configure AWS CodeDeploy. This includes installing the agent on the target host, creating a CodeDeploy Application, and creating a CodeDeploy Deployment Group. Now, you can execute a deployment directly on a local machine or instance where the CodeDeploy agent is installed. If your deployment has errors, you can easily find and view the error logs by accessing the agent with your terminal. This makes it faster and easier to find and fix bugs before configuring CodeDeploy for production.</p> 
<p>To learn how to deploy locally with AWS CodeDeploy, go <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployments-local.html">here</a>. If you already use CodeDeploy, you can enable local deployment testing by updating your agent to version 1.0.1.1352 or later. To learn more about using AWS CodeDeploy, visit the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/welcome.html">documentation</a>.</p> 
<p>The AWS CodeDeploy agent is available globally in the (Ohio), US East (N. Virgina), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), EU (Frankfurt), EU (Ireland), EU (London), and South America (S&atilde;o Paulo) Regions. The CodeDeploy agent is also available in the AWS China (Beijing) Region, operated by Sinnet.

<b id="AWS_Config_Adds_Support_for_AWS_WAF_and_Amazon_CloudFront"> <a name="AWS_Config_Adds_Support_for_AWS_WAF_and_Amazon_CloudFront"> AWS Config Adds Support for AWS WAF and Amazon CloudFront</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 15, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>AWS Config adds support for the following resource types:&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>AWS WAF</b><br /> You can now record configuration changes to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/waf/" target="_blank">AWS WAF</a> with AWS Config. AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. With Config, you can now track changes to WAF web access control lists (web ACLs). For example, you can record creation and deletion of rules and rule actions, as well as updates to WAF rule configurations. You can also track changes to Application Load Balancer associations and default actions.</p> 
<p>AWS Config supports the AWS WAF regional resources in the following AWS regions: US East (N.Virginia), US West (Oregon), US West (N.California), EU (Ireland) and Asia Pacific (Tokyo). The WAF global resources are supported only in the US East (N. Virginia) AWS public region.</p> 
<p><b>Amazon CloudFront</b><br /> You can now also record configuration changes to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" target="_blank">Amazon CloudFront</a>. CloudFront is a global content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to your viewers with low latency and high transfer speeds. With Config, you can now record changes to the CloudFront distribution settings. For example, you can capture distribution state changes, changes to price classes, origins, geo restriction settings, and Lambda@Edge associations with your CloudFront distribution.</p> 
<p>AWS Config supports Amazon CloudFront in the AWS US East (N. Virginia) public region.</p>

<b id="AWS_Step_Functions_adds_Support_for_Updating_State_Machines"> <a name="AWS_Step_Functions_adds_Support_for_Updating_State_Machines"> AWS Step Functions adds Support for Updating State Machines</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 15, 2017</span> </p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/">AWS Step Functions</a> now supports updating state machines, allowing you to easily change your state machine definitions and configurations. AWS Step Functions makes it easy to coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows. Building applications from individual components that each perform a discrete function lets you scale and change applications quickly. Step Functions is a reliable way to coordinate components and step through the functions of your application.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, if you wanted to make changes to your state machine, you had to change the name, which also changed the corresponding Amazon Resource Name (ARN), or delete the state machine and create a new one in order to use the same name. You can now use the new Step Functions API call, UpdateStateMachine, to make changes to your state machine configuration and keep the same name–without deleting it first. This makes it easier to modify and iterate your applications. You retain the history of all state machine executions for the full 90-day retention period, including executions that started before your update. You can also view state machine definitions and the configured roles of all available executions.</p> 
<p>The UpdateStateMachine API call is supported in the Step Functions console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), and AWS CloudFormation–including defining state machines and activities as named resources.</p> 
<p>Updating state machines is supported today in all regions where Step Functions is available, including US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), EU (Frankfurt), EU (Ireland), EU (London), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo) regions.</p>

<b id="Amazon_ECS_Introduces_Task_Networking_for_Containers"> <a name="Amazon_ECS_Introduces_Task_Networking_for_Containers"> Amazon ECS Introduces Task Networking for Containers</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 14, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Tasks running on Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) can now take advantage of <i>awsvpc</i> mode for container networking. This new mode allocates an <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html">elastic networking interface</a> to each running task, providing a dynamic private IP address and internal DNS name. This simplifies container networking operations, allowing tasks to run with full networking features on AWS, just like EC2 instances.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, tasks running on Amazon ECS shared the elastic network interface of their host EC2 instance. This meant that networking containers to communicate with other containers or external traffic sources required you to map the port on each container. This required knowing which ports were available for use and dynamically assigning ports to avoid conflicts. Additionally, using EC2 security groups and network monitoring tools was only possible for a host EC2 instance.</p> 
<p>Now, users can define an Amazon ECS task definition to use task networking. This allows elastic network interfaces to be assigned directly to running Amazon ECS tasks from the VPC subnets designated by the user. This task-level elastic network interface makes it possible to assign EC2 security groups and use standard network monitoring tools at the container level. This simplifies network configuration management, allowing you to treat each container just like an EC2 instance with full networking features in the VPC.</p> 
<p>To learn more about using task networking for your containers, see our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-cloud-native-networking-for-ecs-containers/">hands-on blog</a> or <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html">documentation</a>. You can learn about how task networking&nbsp;works in our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/under-the-hood-task-networking-for-amazon-ecs/">deep-dive blog</a>.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 9, 2017</span> </p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis/">Amazon ElastiCache for Redis</a> introduces Online Cluster Resizing to add and remove shards from a running cluster. You can now dynamically scale-out or scale-in your Redis cluster workloads to adapt to changes in demand. ElastiCache will resize the cluster and redistribute hash slots uniformly across the new shard configuration, all while the cluster continues to stay online and serve requests. Additionally, for optimized processing, you can also rebalance a cluster and uniformly distribute the slot space, without changing the number of shards.<br /> </p> 
<p>Below are the key highlights of the announcement:</p> 
<li><b>Right size and improve efficiency</b> – By dynamically scaling-out and scaling-in a cluster, ElastiCache eliminates the need to overprovision clusters based on peak demand, allowing you to right size clusters, improve efficiency, and reduce costs.<br /> </li> 
<li><b>Online experience</b> – Cluster resizing in ElastiCache is designed to be a fully online experience which ensures availability, performance, durability and data consistency, throughout slot migration.&nbsp; 
<li><b>Availability</b> – Unlike open source Redis, ElastiCache cluster resizing is designed to run multi-threaded operations at the source shard, allowing slot migration to run on a separate thread from the main I/O thread. This allows ElastiCache to deliver a fully online experience and enables the cluster to serve incoming I/O requests while resizing is in progress.&nbsp;</li> 
<li><b>Redis command support</b> – ElastiCache uses atomic slot migration instead of the atomic key migration used by open source Redis. When a key is migrated to the target shard, the source shard maintains a copy and retains ownership of the key, until the entire slot and all its keys are migrated. While this improves performance, it also allows you to benefit from full Redis API coverage, including operations such as multi-key commands, transactions, and LUA scripts.</li> 
<li><b>No Client side changes needed </b>– The enhanced slot distribution used in cluster resizing workflow is compliant with Redis cluster client behavior and does not require any application changes. ElastiCache retains cluster 
<g class="gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" data-gr-id="20">
end points 
</g>, enabling you to continue using existing clients without any changes.</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li><b>Fully managed</b> – ElastiCache provides a full-managed experience where you can initiate cluster resizing as a one-click workflow. Online Cluster Resizing is hardened for better performance, fault tolerance and robustness, eliminating any need for manual intervention to maintain data consistency and data durability.&nbsp;</li> 
<li><b>Integrated experience</b> – Online Cluster Resizing comes with support for API,

CLI 
</g> and AWS Management Console, along with end-to-end monitoring and reporting, and familiar tagging capability.</li> 
<p>These capabilities are available with the latest version, Amazon ElastiCache for Redis 3.2.10, at no additional charge, and maintain open source Redis compatibility.<br /> </p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 9, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Control the tonal quality of Amazon Polly’s voice output with the new vocal-tract-length Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) tag. Adjusting the “vocal tract length” will modify the tone quality, called timbre, to make a voice sound characteristically different without adjusting rate and pitch. This tag can be used with any of the voices in the Amazon Polly Text-to-Speech portfolio to produce many variations for a single voice.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com//d1.awsstatic.com/Polly/Timbre_Sample1.1e7fd4dbc93c78a1f738f2cc41bf097e5a15f19f.wav">&lt;Listen to sample&gt;</a>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You now have more options to customize the Amazon Polly voices – editing and adjusting timbre, rate and pitch to create new personas to fit your needs. Try the new timbre modification control effect through the Amazon Polly console, or visit the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/supported-ssml.html#vocaltractlength-tag" target="_blank">Amazon Polly documentation</a> for more information around SSML tags.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 9, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon Inspector is pleased to announce the addition of native severity data for the Common Vulnerabilities &amp; Exposures (CVE), and CIS Benchmarks rule packages, along with support for security assessments on CentOS Enterprise Linux 7.4 within Amazon EC2. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Prior to this release, Amazon Inspector provided a normalized severity rating for security findings identified by Amazon Inspector. Due to the differences between the severity ratings for rule packages like CVE and CIS Benchmarks, Amazon Inspector transforms these native severities into a standardized 4 tier severity scale of High, Medium, Low, and Informational that is used for all findings regardless of rules package. We will now also expose the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) severity and CVSS vector information associated with all CVE findings. For CIS Benchmarks, we have added the information for the CIS Benchmark Weight, which details whether the benchmark is considered as part of the scoring criteria for the hardening guideline used.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In addition to these findings data enhancements, you can now run assessments for Common Vulnerabilities &amp; Exposures (CVE), Amazon Security Best Practices, and Runtime Behavior Analysis on the most recent version of CentOS Enterprise Linux. To run security assessments, simply install the Amazon Inspector AWS Agent on the desired CentOS-based EC2 instance, configure your assessment in the Amazon Inspector console, and run your assessment.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 9, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Today AWS Direct Connect has landed sites in five cities – Denver, Phoenix, Madrid, Helsinki and Chennai. In the US, CoreSite DE1, Denver and phoenixNAP, Phoenix bring the total AWS Direct Connect sites in the country to 28. With global access enabled for AWS Direct Connect, these sites can reach AWS resources in any global AWS Region. In the AWS Management Console, Denver will be found under its home region of US West (Oregon) and Phoenix will be found in US West (N.California). In Europe, ITConic Madrid 2, now an Equinix datacenter, marks the second AWS Direct Connect site in Madrid and Equinix HE6, Helsinki is the first AWS Direct Connect presence in Finland. Both these sites, Madrid and Helsinki, will be found under the EU Central (Frankfurt) AWS Region in the console. In Asia, India gets its first site outside Mumbai with STT GDC Chennai VSB in Chennai, which will be found in its home region of Asia Pacific (Mumbai). &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Customers in these cities can now establish a dedicated network connection from their premise to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections. Connections are always made to a particular Direct Connect location, and can run at either 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps, or work with a partner to connect at speeds less than 1G.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Please see our AWS website for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/details/">details</a> on our locations and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/pricing/">pricing</a>.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 8, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>We are pleased to announce that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/#application">Application Auto Scaling</a> now supports scheduled scaling, which makes it possible to scale resources at specific preset times or intervals. Application Auto Scaling allows you to automatically scale resources for AWS services beyond Amazon EC2, including Amazon ECS, Amazon EC2 Spot Fleets, Amazon EMR Clusters, AppStream 2.0 fleets, and Amazon DynamoDB.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Scheduled scaling allows you to pre-provision adequate capacity for anticipated demand and then reduce your provisioned capacity as demand lulls. For example, if the traffic to your web application consistently increases each morning, remains high through the day, and decreases each evening, you can use scheduled scaling to add capacity to your resources in the morning, such as increasing your DynamoDB provisioned capacity, while allowing capacity to scale-in later in the day.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Scheduled scaling for Application Auto Scaling is available in all commercial regions. You can start using it today using the AWS <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ApplicationAutoScaling/latest/APIReference/API_ScheduledAction.html" target="_blank">Application Programming Interface (API)</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/application-autoscaling/put-scheduled-action.html" target="_blank">Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>. There is no charge for using Application Auto Scaling; you pay only for the underlying resources provisioned.

<p>Customers can now privately access AWS services from their Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), without using public IPs, and without requiring the traffic to traverse across the Internet. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>AWS PrivateLink is a purpose-built technology designed for customers to access AWS services in a highly available and scalable manner, while keeping all the network traffic within the AWS network. When you create endpoints for AWS services powered by PrivateLink, these service endpoints will appear as Elastic Network Interface (ENI) with private IPs in your VPCs. PrivateLink removes the need of whitelisting public IPs, or managing the Internet connectivity using an Internet Gateway, Network Address Translation (NAT) devices, or firewall proxies to connect to AWS services. AWS services available on PrivateLink also support private connectivity over AWS Direct Connect, so that applications in your own data centers will be able to connect to AWS services via the Amazon private network using the service endpoints. <br /> </p> 
<p>AWS services currently available on AWS PrivateLink include Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Kinesis Streams, Service Catalog and EC2 Systems Manager, and support for additional AWS services will be added in the coming months. AWS PrivateLink is available in all the commercial regions except China (Beijing).

<p>The Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) command line interface (CLI) is now available as version 1.0.0.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Amazon ECS CLI is a developer tool that is built to make it easy to run applications with Amazon ECS. This CLI allows you to create and manage Amazon ECS clusters and tasks with fewer commands when using a terminal interface.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, the Amazon ECS CLI only allowed you to configure one set of clusters and credentials for testing containers and was only available for Linux or Mac environments.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now, the Amazon ECS CLI v1.0.0 allows you to store multiple cluster and credential configurations and allows you to easily switch between different cluster and credential configuration. You can specify additional ECS task definition parameters and the CLI is available for Linux, Mac, and Windows environments.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 6, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>You now have a number of new Amazon S3 features to augment data protection and simplify compliance.</p> 
<p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/crr.html" target="_blank">Cross-Region Replication</a> (CRR) can now replicate storage encrypted by the AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) across AWS regions for low-latency data access, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>CRR can also help you protect against malicious or accidental deletion by maintaining a pristine copy of your data in a separate account with a different ownership stack. CRR now supports ownership overwrite, which allows you to grant access to a different destination bucket owner and revoke access permission on the replicated objects from the source bucket owner. This provides separate ownership of your data between source and destination account when you set up CRR across accounts.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It is now easier to ensure encryption of all new objects and monitor and report on their encryption status. Default Encryption is a bucket-level setting that automatically encrypt objects when they are stored in an S3 bucket using server-side encryption with S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS KMS managed keys (SSE-KMS). <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-inventory.html" target="_blank">S3 Inventory</a> reports now include encryption status in its list of objects and their metadata. This is a scheduled report provided on a daily or weekly basis for a bucket or prefix. The addition of encryption status in S3 inventory allows you to see how objects are encrypted for compliance auditing or other purposes. You can also encrypt S3 Inventory with SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The AWS console now highlights all publicly-accessible S3 buckets. Bucket Permissions Check will display the source for the public access (bucket policy, bucket ACLs, or both). In addition, when you change bucket policy or bucket ACLs, S3 console will analyze them and alert you if those changes will enable public read and write access on the bucket.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These new features are available in all commercial regions except AWS China (Beijing). Visit the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3" target="_blank">AWS Management Console</a> to get started.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 6, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>The AWS Price List API lets you access detailed pricing information for AWS services in JSON form. You can also opt in to receive updates when prices change by subscribing to Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, the AWS Price List API only returned product pricing information at the region and AWS service levels, but has been enhanced to return pricing information filtered across a wide array of product dimensions. You can now build highly-specific requests that return targeted pricing information; for example, prices for all EC2 instances in the AWS Asia Pacific (Mumbai) region with 64 vCPUs and 256 GB of memory, where SQL Server Enterprise comes pre-installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amazon EC2 Systems Manager now supports inventory collection from Windows Registry,&nbsp;Windows services, roles and features enabled in Windows Server, and Windows and Linux file metadata such as when a file is created, modified, or accessed.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, you had to write your own scripts to collect metadata from Windows Registry, Windows services, roles and features enabled in Windows Server, and file metadata. Now, Systems Manager will automatically collect metadata from these types, giving you more options for enabling IT governance and compliance scenarios such as application asset management, license tracking, and file integrity monitoring. For example, you can determine if and when unauthorized files were installed on your instance and when they were last accessed, or you can find applications even if they were installed without an installer.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon EC2 Systems Manager is available in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">all commercial AWS regions and AWS GovCloud</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 6, 2017</span> </p> 
<p> In September 2016, we introduced Convertible RIs which provide customers with the flexibility to change an RI’s instance type, OS, tenancy or payment option during its term. Today, we are announcing a few enhancements to Convertible RIs.</p> 
<p> First, you can now purchase Convertible RIs for a 1 year term. Until today, Convertible RIs were only available with a 3 year term. While customers have told us they like the flexibility of Convertible RIs, some have said that they want to make a shorter commitment. Now customers can get the flexibility of Convertible RIs with a shorter term length.</p> 
<p>Additionally, we have improved the Convertible RI exchange process by adding the ability for customers to exchange a portion of an RI as well as merge the value from multiple RIs for use in a single exchange. These enhancements provide more flexibility when exchanging your Convertible RIs.<br /> </p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 6, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>AWS launches new billing preferences that give you control over how AWS credits and RI discounts are shared among the accounts in your organization.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Historically, AWS has maximized customer savings by applying credits and RI discounts first to the account that owned the credit or RI lease and then distributing the remainder, if any, to&nbsp;qualifying usage incurred by accounts in the same organization. While this approach had the potential of lowering the overall bill, customers were unable to control if, and how, discounts were applied across&nbsp;organizational lines.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To provide greater flexibility, customers can now disable AWS credit sharing across all accounts in their organization. This ensures that only the account that owns a credit, or has previously redeemed a credit, receives the associated benefit.&nbsp;Similarly, you can now disable RI discount sharing across your organization to ensure that only the RI owner receives any associated discounts. You can also designate a set of accounts for which RI discount sharing is disabled, while continuing to share RI discounts among the rest of the accounts in your organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Device and init flags can now be specified in task definitions for Docker containers managed by Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#add-host-device-to-container-device" target="_blank">device flag</a> enables containers to attach to external devices without using privileged mode. Previously, to mount a device to a Docker container required starting the container in privileged mode. Now, you can specify devices in the Amazon ECS task definition, allowing containers to mount devices such as EBS volumes.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#exit-status" target="_blank">init flag</a> runs an init process as PID 1 in the container. Previously, if certain containerized processes did not exit nicely, they could continue to run – incurring unneeded utilization and cost. Now, you can specify the Docker init parameter in the Amazon ECS task definition. This ensures the init process is the parent for all processes inside a container, and can terminate processes that have finished execution, but are still running.</p>

<p>Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) now allows applications running in containers to directly access metadata about their environment.<br /> </p> 
<p>Previously, if an application running in a container managed by Amazon ECS required access to information about its environment, you needed to manually call this metadata using the Docker or Amazon ECS introspection API, and inject it into the container.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now, applications running in containers managed by Amazon ECS can directly query environmental metadata such as the Docker container and Docker image name and id, the container’s networking configuration and port mapping, as well as the ECS Task’s and Container Instance Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This makes applications running on Amazon ECS environment-aware, and enables them to self-register in Service Discovery and Configuration Management solutions. &nbsp;</p>

This announcement means you can use ElastiCache for Redis to store, process, and access protected health information (PHI) and power secure healthcare applications. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/what-is-redis/">Redis</a>, an open source, in-memory data store, is a popular choice among developers to power low latency, high throughput internet scale applications. ElastiCache for Redis is a Redis-compatible, fully-managed, in-memory data store and cache in the cloud that delivers sub-millisecond response times with millions of requests per second. Now you can use the speed, simplicity, security, and scalability of ElastiCache for Redis for use cases such as database and application caching, session management, queues, chat/messaging, streaming analytics, and geospatial analytics to build secure, fast, and scalable healthcare apps.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>HIPAA Eligible ElastiCache for Redis is available for all current-generation instance node types and requires <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/SelectEngine.RedisVersions.html#SelectEngine.RedisVersions.RedisVersions.3-2-6" target="_blank">Redis engine version 3.2.6</a>.

<p>ElastiCache for Redis uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="_blank">Advanced Encryption Standard</a> (AES)-512 symmetric keys to encrypt data on disk. The Redis backups stored in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> are encrypted with Server Side Encryption (SSE) using AES-256 symmetric keys. ElastiCache for Redis uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" target="_blank">Transport Layer Security</a> (TLS) to encrypt data in transit. It uses the Redis AUTH token that you provide at the time of Redis cluster creation to authenticate the Redis commands coming from clients.

Today, we launched two new features that provide explanations of the anomalies, making it easy for you to perform root cause analysis. You can learn which fields in your data lead to high anomaly scores and identify trends associated with the anomaly.</p> 
<p>Kinesis Analytics uses <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/analytics/whitepaper-real-time-anomaly-detection/">Random Cut Forest algorithm</a> to analyze one or more numeric fields and generate scores to identify anomalies in data streams. When records in your data stream have a large number of fields, it can be difficult to manually determine which fields lead to high anomaly scores, especially when the data is large, moves fast, and changes frequently. Kinesis Analytics now provides real-time explanations of the anomaly scores using attribution and directionality. Attribution explains the contribution of input fields to the overall score, and directionality provides information about the trends such as dips and spikes in each field.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 2, 2017</span> </p> 
<p> You can now choose from two types of API endpoints when creating REST APIs and custom domains with Amazon API Gateway. A regional API endpoint is a new type of endpoint that is accessed from the same AWS region in which your REST API is deployed. This helps you reduce request latency when API requests originate from the same region as your REST API. Additionally, you can now choose to associate your own Amazon CloudFront distribution with the regional API endpoint. The second type of API endpoint is the edge-optimized API. Edge-optimized APIs are endpoints that are accessed through a CloudFront distribution that is created and managed by API Gateway. Previously, edge-optimized APIs were the default option for creating APIs with API Gateway.</p> 
<p> To get started, create a new REST API using the Amazon API Gateway console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs and APIs. You can also migrate existing REST APIs and custom domains to a regional API endpoint. Visit our <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/create-regional-api.html">documentation</a> to learn more about this feature.</p> 
<p> This feature is now available in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), US West (N. California), Canada (Central), South America (S&atilde;o Paulo), EU (Ireland), EU (Frankfurt), EU (London), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Seoul), and Asia Pacific (Mumbai) AWS regions.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 1, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Apache MXNet version 0.12 is now available with two new important features—support for NVIDIA Volta GPUs, and support for Sparse Tensors.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Support for NVIDIA Volta GPU Architecture</b></p> 
<p>The MXNet v0.12 release adds support for NVIDIA Volta V100 GPUs, enabling customers to train convolutional neural networks up to 3.5 times faster than on the Pascal GPUs. The Volta GPU architecture introduces Tensor Cores, which allow mixed-precision training. With mixed precision of Tensor Cores, users can achieve optimal training performance without sacrificing accuracy by using FP16 for most of the layers of a network, and higher precision data types only when necessary. You can take advantage of Volta Tensor Cores to enable FP16 training in MXNet by passing a simple command.</p> 
<p>Recently we announced a new set of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ai/announcing-new-aws-deep-learning-ami-for-amazon-ec2-p3-instances/#more-2093" target="_blank">AWS Deep Learning AMIs</a>, which come pre-installed with various deep learning frameworks including MXNet v0.12, optimized for the NVIDIA Volta V100 GPUs in the Amazon EC2 P3 instance family. You can start with just one click from the AWS Marketplace or follow this <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ai/get-started-with-deep-learning-using-the-aws-deep-learning-ami/" target="_blank">step-by-step guide</a> to get started with your first <a href="http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/tutorials/index.html" target="_blank">notebook</a>.</p> 
<p><b>Sparse Tensor Support<br /> <br /> </b>MXNet v0.12 adds support for sparse tensors to efficiently store and compute tensors allowing developers to perform sparse matrix operations in a storage and compute-efficient manner and train deep learning models faster. This release supports two major sparse data formats–Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) and Row Sparse (RSP). The CSR format is optimized to represent matrices with large number of columns where each row has only a few non-zero elements. The RSP format is optimized to represent matrices with huge number of rows where most of the row slices are completely zeros. This release enables sparse support on CPU for most commonly used operators such as matrix dot product and element-wise operators. Sparse support for more operators will be added in future releases.</p>

<b id="AWS_Direct_Connect_Enables_Global_Access"> <a name="AWS_Direct_Connect_Enables_Global_Access"> AWS Direct Connect Enables Global Access</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 1, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>AWS Direct Connect provides private, high bandwidth connectivity between customer networks and AWS Cloud. The traffic sent over AWS Direct Connect connection stays within the AWS private network instead of traversing the public internet.<br /> </p> 
<p>Today, we are pleased to announce multiple new features for AWS Direct Connect. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Global Access for Virtual Private Cloud</b>:&nbsp;To enable global access to customers’ Amazon VPCs, AWS Direct Connect is announcing Direct Connect Gateway, a new feature to allow customers using any AWS Direct Connect Location to use their Direct Connect connections to access any Virtual Private Cloud deployed in any AWS Regions (except AWS China Region). In addition, each Direct Connect Gateway will enable association with one or more Amazon VPCs. Using Direct Connect Gateway, you do not need to have connections in multiple AWS Regions to access your Amazon VPCs in those AWS Regions, and use one (or more) private virtual interface to communicate with multiple Amazon VPCs across any AWS Regions (except AWS China Region).</p> 
<p><b>Global Access for AWS Public Services</b>:&nbsp;To provide global access to Amazon’s publicly routable services, AWS Direct Connect is expanding public inter-region access service at global scale. AWS Direct Connect customers in any AWS Direct Connect location can create public virtual interface to receive Amazon’s global IP routes, and access Amazon’s publicly routable services in any AWS Regions (except AWS China Region). With Global Public Access, you can now access all of Amazon’s public services using newly created AWS Direct Connect public virtual interfaces amplifying the value of your AWS Direct Connect connection.</p> 
<p><b>New Data Transfer Out pricing structure</b>:&nbsp;Effective immediately, customers will be able to determine the Data Transfer Out pricing based on the location of the workload (AWS Region) and the location of the Direct Connect location. With updated data transfer out pricing structure, you can select any AWS Direct Connect location out of our constantly growing locations across the world that best meets your needs.&nbsp;Please visit <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/pricing/">AWS Direct Connect Pricing</a>.</p> 
<p>All new features are generally available in all public AWS Regions (Except AWS China Region), including AWS GovCloud (US).
