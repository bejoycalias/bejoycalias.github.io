<b id="Amazon_Aurora_with_PostgreSQL_Compatibility_Supports_Fast_Database_Cloning"> <a name="Amazon_Aurora_with_PostgreSQL_Compatibility_Supports_Fast_Database_Cloning"> Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL Compatibility Supports Fast Database Cloning</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Apr 10, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Users of the PostgreSQL-compatible edition of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/">Amazon Aurora</a> users can now create quick, efficient database clones. Cloning is useful for a number of purposes including application development, testing, database updates, and running analytical queries.</p> 
<p>Fast Database Cloning was <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/08/amazon-aurora-supports-fast-database-cloning/">announced</a> for the MySQL-compatible edition in August 2017. Entire multi-terabyte database clusters can be cloned in minutes, which can significantly accelerate your software development and upgrade projects, and make analytics more accurate.</p> 
<p>You can clone an Amazon Aurora database with just a few clicks in the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds">RDS Management Console</a>, without impacting the production environment. The clone is distributed and replicated across 3 availability zones. You can create multiple clones of the same database, and even clones of clones.</p> 
<p>A cloning operation does not incur any storage charges, so you can create as many database copies as you need and only pay for the instance-hours used. You’ll be charged for additional storage space only if you make data changes. Please refer to the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Aurora.Managing.Clone.html">Amazon Aurora documentation</a> for more information.</p> 
<p>Amazon Aurora combines the performance and availability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open source databases. For more information, please visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/">Amazon Aurora product page</a>, and see the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS Region Table</a> for complete regional availability.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Apr 10, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>AWS Glue updated its Apache Spark infrastructure to support Apache Spark 2.2.1. This allows you to take advantage of stability fixes and new features available in this version of Apache Spark.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glue/" target="_blank">AWS Glue</a> is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy for you to prepare and load your data for analytics. With this release, your ETL jobs and development endpoints will now run on a serverless, fully managed Apache Spark 2.2.1 environment.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>AWS Glue is available in the AWS Regions US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), EU (Frankfurt), EU (Ireland), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo).&nbsp;</p> 
<b id="AWS_Glue_now_supports_Timeout_Values_for_ETL_jobs"> <a name="AWS_Glue_now_supports_Timeout_Values_for_ETL_jobs"> AWS Glue now supports Timeout Values for ETL jobs</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Apr 10, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>AWS Glue now enables you to set a timeout value on extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs as a safeguard against runaway jobs.</p> 
<p>Runaway ETL jobs may occur due to coding errors or data anomalies, and they can continue to consume resources without making progress. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glue/" target="_blank">AWS Glue</a> gives you the ability to set a timeout value on any new ETL job that you create, and edit existing jobs to specify a timeout value or use the default value. When the specified timeout limit has been reached, Glue will terminate the ETL job, stop billing for the job, and send a job TIMEOUT notification to Amazon CloudWatch. With this release, all new ETL jobs will have a default timeout value of 48 hours. For more information, please check our <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-job.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p> 
<p>AWS Glue is available in the AWS Regions US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), EU (Frankfurt), EU (Ireland), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo).<br /> </p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)</a> now allows you to dynamically get the latest ECS-optimized Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID when creating a cluster made up of EC2 instances.</p> 
<p>It is a best practice to use the latest version of the ECS-Optimized AMI when you create a new EC2 cluster for Amazon ECS, as new releases include bug fixes and feature updates. Previously, to ensure you were using the latest AMI meant checking the AWS Documentation or subscribing to the ECS-AMI SNS topic. You then had to manually update any templates or resources with the new AMI ID.</p> 
<p>Now, you can simply query the SSM Parameter Store API to get the latest AMI version ID or a list of available AMI IDs and their corresponding Docker runtime and ECS agent versions. You can query the SSM Parameter Store API using the AWS CLI or any of the AWS SDKs.</p> 
<p>To see the latest ECS Optimized Amazon Linux AMI information in your default region, run this AWS CLI command in your terminal:<br /> <br /> <i>aws ssm get-parameters --names /aws/service/ecs/optimized-ami/amazon-linux/recommended</i></p>

<p>You can now share mailboxes among your team members. All users that have been granted access to a shared mailbox can send and receive emails using this mailbox without the need to manually share access credentials. Shared mailboxes make it easy to use email addresses that need to be monitored and used by multiple people. For example, a company could create a single email address for sales inquiries (such as sales@yourcompany.com), and provide access to all sales people so that they can respond.<br /> </p> 
<p>To create a shared mailbox, create a mailbox in the Amazon WorkMail management console and select the <b>Permissions</b> tab. Then, add users and groups, and select whether they have <b>Full Access</b>, <b>Send As</b>, or <b>Send on Behalf</b> permissions for the mailbox. <b>Full Access</b> allows a user or group to access the entire mailbox, and create folders that only certain users can access. <b>Send As</b> allows users to send emails using the mailbox's email alias, and <b>Send on Behalf</b> allows users to send emails using the mailbox’s email alias but still be identified as the actual sender.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Apr 4, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Starting now, Amazon S3 Select is available for all customers. S3 Select is a new Amazon S3 capability designed to pull out only the data you need from an object, which can dramatically improve the performance and reduce the cost of applications that need to access data in S3.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Most applications have to retrieve the entire object and then filter out only the required data for further analysis. S3 Select enables applications to offload the heavy lifting of filtering and accessing data inside objects to the Amazon S3 service. By reducing the volume of data that has to be loaded and processed by your applications, S3 Select can improve the performance of most applications that frequently access data from S3 by up to 400%.</p> 
<p>Now, you can use S3 Select from the&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/" target="_blank">AWS SDK for Java</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/" target="_blank">AWS SDK for Python</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">AWS CLI</a>.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Apr 4, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA; Z-IA) is a new storage class designed for customers who want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the multiple Availability Zone data resilience model of the S3 Standard and S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA; S-IA) storage classes. S3 One Zone-IA is intended for use cases with infrequently accessed data that is re-creatable, such as storing secondary backup copies of on-premises data or for storage that is already replicated in another AWS Region for compliance or disaster recovery purposes. With S3 One Zone-IA, customers can now store infrequently accessed data within a single Availability Zone at 20% lower cost than S3 Standard-IA. In addition, S3 One Zone-IA can offer customers higher availability and durability than self-managed physical data centers, with the added benefit of having to pay only for what they use.</p> 
<p>Amazon S3 Standard, S3 Standard-IA, S3 One Zone-IA, and Amazon Glacier, are all designed for 99.999999999% durability. Amazon S3 Standard, S3 Standard-IA and Amazon Glacier distribute data across a minimum of three geographically-separated Availability Zones to offer the highest level of resilience to AZ loss. S3 One Zone-IA saves cost by storing infrequently accessed data with lower resilience in a single Availability Zone.&nbsp; Amazon S3 Standard-IA is a good choice for long-term storage of master data that is infrequently accessed. For other infrequently accessed data, such as duplicates of backups or data summaries that can be regenerated, S3 One Zone-IA provides a lower price point. </p> 
<p>Data can be uploaded directly into S3 One Zone-IA, or can be populated by using S3 Lifecycle policies to tier data into S3 One Zone-IA. S3 One Zone-IA is available today in all AWS commercial Regions.</p> 
<p>To learn more about S3 One Zone-IA visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/" target="_blank">Amazon S3 storage classes page</a>.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Apr 4, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>AWS Config now includes multi-account, multi-region data aggregation, enabling centralized auditing and governance. This feature reduces the time and overhead needed to gather an enterprise-wide view of your compliance status.<br /> </p> 
<p>Previously, you had to gather information individually from each account and each region using APIs or custom tools to view your enterprise-wide compliance status. Now, you can monitor your Config rule compliance status across your enterprise through a central dashboard, without the need to navigate between multiple consoles. You can also dive deeper to view status for a specific region or a specific account across regions, helping you identify non-compliant accounts.<br /> </p> 
<p>You can get started by enabling Config and Config rules in your accounts. Next, create an aggregator and provide a list of AWS account IDs or, if you are an AWS Organizations customer, your organization details. This specifies the accounts whose compliance data needs to be aggregated. The aggregated dashboard in AWS Config will display the total count of non-compliant rules across the organization, the top five non-compliant rules by number of resources, and the top five AWS accounts that have the most number of non-compliant rules. You can then drill down to view details about the resources that are violating the rule, and the list of rules that are being violated by an account.<br /> </p> 
<p>The multi-account, multi-region data aggregation capability is available in the following nine regions: US East (N.Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), US West (San Francisco), EU (Ireland), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and Asia Pacific (Singapore).</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/" target="_blank">Amazon Elasticsearch Service</a> now integrates with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/" target="_blank">Amazon Cognito</a> to provide user-level authentication for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/kibana/" target="_blank">Kibana</a>, without the need to configure and manage a proxy server. With today’s release, you can sign-in to the service through enterprise identity providers such as Microsoft Active Directory using SAML 2.0, and through social identity providers such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon. You can also set up a secure, scalable, and simplified sign-up experience using Amazon Cognito User Pools. Once you sign-in, Amazon Cognito establishes a session using the appropriate <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/" target="_blank">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> role, which provides access to the Amazon Elasticsearch Service domain.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>All Amazon Elasticsearch Service domains include Kibana, an open-source data visualization and exploration tool used for log and time series analytics including application monitoring, clickstream analytics, and more. Kibana tightly integrates with Elasticsearch and is the default choice for Elasticsearch data visualizations.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Kibana authentication is supported on all domains that use Elasticsearch 5.1 or greater and is available in 15 regions globally: US East (N. Virginia, Ohio), US West (Oregon, N. California), Canada (Central), South America (Sao Paulo), EU (Ireland, London, Frankfurt, Paris), and Asia Pacific (Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo, Seoul, Mumbai).

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Apr 2, 2018</span> </p> 
<p> Amazon Rekognition has improved real-time facial recognition and verification accuracy for even more accurate facial authentication and people search use cases. For face verification applications, Rekognition is now up to 80% more accurate in distinguishing between people who look very similar to each other, and up to 35% more accurate in recognizing the same person with substantial changes in their appearance (hairstyle, hair color, facial hair, glasses, etc.). This reduces both false accepts and false rejects when matching pairs of faces.</p> 
<p> With Amazon Rekognition, you can also perform real-time search against tens of millions of faces. With this update, Amazon Rekognition is now up to 25% more accurate in picking out the right face from a digital gallery containing millions of faces. </p> 
<p>Amazon Rekognition is helping customers create new experiences for their users. FamilySearch, the largest genealogical organization in the world, uses Amazon Rekognition to help fulfill their mission of connecting families across generations. &quot;FamilySearch developed ‘Compare-a-Face’ using Rekognition to help site users see which of their ancestors they most resemble based on family photographs,&quot; said Tom Creighton, CTO and Lead Architect at FamilySearch. &quot;Rekognition was used to provide an engaging experience that helped people relate to their forbearers in a new way.&quot;</p> 
<p>To try out these updates, simply log in to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/" target="_blank">Amazon Rekognition Console</a> or create a new collection of faces as described in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/collections.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>. Please note that existing face collections will continue to use the previous face model. For more details on face model versioning, please see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/face-detection-model.html" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>
