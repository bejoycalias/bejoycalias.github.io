<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jan 17, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>You can now publish logs from your RDS for MySQL and MariaDB databases to CloudWatch Logs. Supported logs include general log, slow query log, audit log, and error log. Publishing these logs to CloudWatch Logs allows you to maintain continuous visibility into database activity, query performance, and errors in your RDS for MySQL and MariaDB databases. For example, you can set up CloudWatch Alarms to notify you on frequent restarts which are recorded in the error log. Similarly, alarms for events recorded in general or audit logs can be created to alert on unwanted changes made to your databases. You may also create alarms to monitor the slow query log and enable timely detection of long-running queries.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>CloudWatch Logs provide a durable archive destination for your database logs. You can specify a retention period to indicate how long you want CloudWatch to retain your logs. Additionally, with CloudWatch Logs, you can perform ad hoc searches across multiple logs. This capability is particularly useful for troubleshooting, audits, and log analysis.</p> 
<p>Read the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/monitor-amazon-rds-for-mysql-and-mariadb-logs-with-amazon-cloudwatch/" target="_blank">blog post</a> and refer to documentation on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.Concepts.MySQL.html#USER_LogAccess.MySQLDB.PublishtoCloudWatchLogs" target="_blank">RDS for MySQL</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.Concepts.MariaDB.html#USER_LogAccess.MariaDB.PublishtoCloudWatchLogs" target="_blank">RDS for MariaDB</a> for more information.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jan 17, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>M5 Instances, the next generation of the Amazon EC2 General Purpose compute instances, were <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/introducing-amazon-ec2-m5-instances/">introduced</a> in November 2017 to offer a balance of compute, memory, storage and networking resources for a broad range of customer workloads. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Starting today, M5 instances are available in the AWS US West (N. California) and Europe (London), in addition to the AWS US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), EU (Ireland) and EU (Paris) Regions announced previously. M5 instances are available in 6 sizes, with 2, 4, 8, 16, 48, and 96 vCPUs and purchasable as On-Demand, Reserved, Spot and as Dedicated Instances or Dedicated Hosts. </p> 
<p>M5 Instances are the next generation of the Amazon EC2 General Purpose compute instances, powered by 2.5 GHz Intel&reg; Xeon Platinum 8175 processors, part of the Intel Xeon Scalable processor family (formerly codenamed Skylake), and featuring Intel’s newest vector processing instruction set, Advanced Vector Extension 512 (AVX-512). M5 instances are based on the Nitro System, a combination of dedicated hardware and the lightweight Nitro Hypervisor, which delivers practically all of the compute and memory resources of the host hardware to your instances. They deliver up to 14% improvement in price/performance compared to M4 instances with the updated processor. The addition of new AVX-512 delivers 2x the performance per core for vector and floating point intensive workloads such as image and video processing, data compression, cryptography, and high-performance web serving. </p>

<p>C5 Instances, the next generation of the Amazon EC2 Compute Optimized instances powered by 3.0 GHz Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Scalable processors (Skylake), were <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/introducing-amazon-ec2-c5-instances-the-next-generation-of-compute-optimized-instances/">introduced</a> in November 2017. C5 instances are built using a new light-weight hypervisor, which provides practically all of the compute and memory resources to customer’s workloads.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Starting today, C5 instances are available in the AWS US West (N. California) and Europe (London), in addition to the US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), EU (Ireland) and EU (Paris) Regions. C5 instances are available in 6 sizes and introduce a new larger size, c5.18xlarge, which provides 72 vCPUs and 144 GiB of memory and purchasable as On-Demand, Reserved, Spot and as Dedicated Instances or Dedicated Hosts in these AWS Regions. </p> 
<p>C5 instances are based on the Nitro System, a combination of dedicated hardware and the lightweight Nitro Hypervisor, which delivers practically all of the compute and memory resources of the host hardware to your instances. As a result, C5 instances deliver the best price/compute performance in the EC2 product family, with a 25% improvement in price/performance compared to C4 instances and certain applications delivering greater than 50% improvement. C5 instances are ideal for running compute-heavy workloads like batch processing, distributed analytics, high-performance computing (HPC), machine/deep learning inference, ad serving, highly scalable multiplayer gaming, and video encoding.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jan 16, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Today, we are introducing volume-based tiered pricing for Vended logs in CloudWatch Logs, effective January 1, 2018. Vended logs are logs that are natively published by AWS services on behalf of the customer. VPC Flow logs is the first Vended log type that will benefit from this tiered model. However, more AWS Service log types will be added to Vended Logs in the future.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>CloudWatch Vended logs tiered pricing starts at 10 TB (or 10,240 GB). Usage from 10TB to 30TB (30,720 GB) will benefit from a 50% discount on ingestion price in every region. Usage from 30TB to 50TB (51,200 GB) will benefit from an 80% discount and finally, any usage above 50TB will benefit from a 90% discount on ingestion price in every region. Below is the tiered pricing for US East (N. Virginia).</p> 
<p>$0.50 per GB for the first 10TB of vended log data ingested <br /> $0.25 per GB for the next 20TB of vended log data ingested <br /> $0.10 per GB for the next 20TB of vended log data ingested<br /> $0.05 per GB for vended log data ingested over 50TB</p> 
<p>Today's price drop continues the AWS tradition of reducing our costs and passing the savings along to our customers. This new pricing will be reflected on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/">Amazon CloudWatch pricing page</a>, available in all public regions.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jan 11, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon Inspector has released an enhancement to the Inspector Agent that will allow it to perform assessments for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks, and AWS Security Best Practices on supported operating systems, regardless of the kernel version installed. Prior to this release, the Inspector Agent was dependent on an internal kernel module that supported specific Linux OS kernel versions. The Inspector Agent could not be installed or used to run any security assessments for supported Linux operating systems that were using non-default, older, or custom kernels. With this update, you can use any kernel and run those assessments.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You will still need a compatible kernel to run the Runtime Behavior Analysis rules package due to the nature of that assessment. Runtime Behavior Analysis actively monitors the OS and installed applications behavior over a defined period, which requires access to the operating system kernel in order to gather the required telemetry data. To see a list of compatible kernel versions, go <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_supported_os_regions.html#inspector_supported-linux-os" target="_blank">here</a>. If your assessment template includes Runtime Behavior Analysis, and any of your instances have an unsupported kernel version, Inspector will complete the assessment and issue an informational finding for those instances letting you know that the Runtime Behavioral Analysis rules package is not supported for that kernel version.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starting today, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon RDS</a> Read Replicas for MySQL and MariaDB now support Multi-AZ deployments. Combining Read Replicas with Multi-AZ enables you to build a resilient disaster recovery strategy and simplify your database engine upgrade process.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/read-replicas/">Amazon RDS Read Replicas</a> enable you to create one or more read-only copies of your database instance within the same AWS Region or in a different AWS Region. Updates made to the source database are then asynchronously copied to your Read Replicas. In addition to providing scalability for read-heavy workloads, Read Replicas can be promoted to become a standalone database instance when needed.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/multi-az/">Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments</a> provide enhanced availability for database instances within a single AWS Region. With Multi-AZ, your data is synchronously replicated to a standby in a different Availability Zone (AZ). In the event of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby, minimizing disruption to your applications.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can now use Read Replicas with Multi-AZ as part of a disaster recovery (DR) strategy for your production databases. A well-designed and tested DR plan is critical for maintaining business continuity after a disaster. A Read Replica in a different region than the source database can be used as a standby database and promoted to become the new production database in case of a regional disruption.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can also combine Read Replicas with Multi-AZ for your database engine upgrade process. You can create a Read Replica of your production database instance and upgrade it to a new database engine version. When the upgrade is complete, you can stop applications, promote the Read Replica to a standalone database instance, and switch over your applications. Since the database instance is already a Multi-AZ deployment, no additional steps are needed.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Jan 10, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>AWS Batch now supports AWS CloudTrail audit calls to Batch APIs. AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. With AWS CloudTrail, customers can now audit calls to AWS Batch APIs, making it easier to ensure compliance with internal policies and regulatory standards.</p> 
<p>AWS Batch is a fully-managed batch processing service which allows you to easily run your jobs of varying sizes across a dynamically-scaled fleet of Amazon EC2 instances. AWS Batch eliminates the need for you to install, operate, and scale your own cluster management and batch processing infrastructure.</p> 
<p>This change is effective today in all AWS Regions supported by AWS Batch. AWS Batch is currently available in the following regions: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), EU (Ireland), EU (London), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney).&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can now use the DeepAR forecasting algorithm for model training in Amazon SageMaker.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>DeepAR is an algorithm that generates accurate forecasts by learning patterns from time-series over multiple large sets of training data with related time-series. The DeepAR algorithm learns similarities across the related&nbsp;items in the dataset to provide more accurate forecasts. This method improves upon common forecasting methods like Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models or exponential smoothing which treat each time-series independently. By using the shared information across related time-series, DeepAR can be applied to a number of time-series challenges, such as predicting future product sales to improve supply chain management, forecasting traffic to servers or web pages, or estimating future electricity consumption at the individual household level.</p> 
<p>The DeepAR algorithm is available today in the US East (N. Virginia &amp; Ohio), EU (Ireland) and U.S. West (Oregon) AWS regions. To learn more, visit the Amazon SageMaker <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deepar.html" target="_blank">documentation for the DeepAR algorithm</a>.</p>
