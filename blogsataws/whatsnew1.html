<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 15, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Today we are releasing support for using GraphQL subscriptions with the AWS AppSync Android SDK. Complex Object capabilities, which allow GraphQL operations using content stored in Amazon S3 using an Amazon DynamoDB link are also now supported as part of this release. These features provide customers capabilities to have real-time data streamed to their applications from data sources such as Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Elasticsearch service, or AWS Lambda.</p> 
<p>Additionally, we are releasing a JavaScript sample application that showcases usage of the AWS Amplify library and AWS AppSync together along with the Complex Objects feature. This sample showcases a comprehensive solution for a private photo storage application, where users can register and sign-in to an application. Photos can be synchronized across devices where users logon and is protected via multi-factor authentication (MFA), and GraphQL records are authorized on a per-user basis. The sample application is written in React and available for download on GitHub.</p> 
<p>AWS AppSync is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">available</a> from the following regions: US-East-1 (Virginia), US-East-2 (Ohio), US-West-2 (Oregon), EU-West-1 (Ireland), AP-Northeast-1 (Tokyo), and AP-Southeast-2 (Sydney) regions.</p>

<b id="AWS_CloudTrail_Log_Search_Using_Amazon_Athena"> <a name="AWS_CloudTrail_Log_Search_Using_Amazon_Athena"> AWS CloudTrail Log Search Using Amazon Athena</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 15, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>AWS CloudTrail makes it easier to search CloudTrail log files using the power of Amazon Athena. Previously, you had to manually create a CloudTrail table using the Athena console or AWS CLI and ensure you had the proper configuration and data definitions to match the CloudTrail log format. Now, from within the CloudTrail console event history page, you simply enter the Amazon S3 bucket where your CloudTrail logs are stored, and CloudTrail will automatically create the Athena table for you. Once the table is created, you’ll be able to jump directly to the Athena console query editor and immediately begin running queries.</p> 
<p>This allows you to use common SQL queries to search for specific sets of activities recorded by AWS CloudTrail. For example, you can easily identifying console logins from outside the corporate network that didn’t use multi-factor authentication or you can query for API failures for a given resource that occurred during a specific timeframe. There is no cost to setup the integration and create the CloudTrail table within Athena. Running Athena queries within the Athena query editor or using the AWS CLI will incur standard Athena charges. Please visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/athena/pricing/">Amazon Athena pricing</a> page for more information.</p> 
<p>The integration within the AWS CloudTrail console is available in all AWS public regions, as well as the AWS GovCloud (US) Region, the China (Beijing) Region, and the China (Ningxia) Region. Please visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS Region Table</a> page to see the Athena supported regions in which you can create the CloudTrail table and run corresponding queries.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 15, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Starting today, you can now use Amazon CloudFront to negotiate HTTPS connections to origins using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). ECDSA uses smaller keys that are faster, yet, just as secure, as the older RSA algorithm. The smaller keys will also increase the number of TLS handshakes that your origins can process per second, thereby saving compute cycles and reducing your cost of cryptography. To enable ECDSA, simply configure your origin server to use and prefer an ECDSA certificate. There is no additional fee for using this feature. To learn more about how ECDSA works on CloudFront, see the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/cloudfront-now-supports-ecdsa-certificates-for-https-connections-to-origins/">blog post</a> and the CloudFront <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers-cloudfront-to-origin">Developer Guide</a>.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 15, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>We’re excited to announce the availability of Lumberyard Beta 1.13. With over 220 improvements, fixes, and new features, this release helps game teams create cloud-connected games with less engineering resources. Some highlights include:</p> 
<li>Cloud Gem Cross-Communication. Developers can now expose API operations from one Cloud Gem to another, so they can more easily create complex, cloud-connected gameplay functionality. For example, developers can now use the Message of the Day Cloud Gem with the Text to Speech Cloud Gem to send procedurally voiced messages to their players.</li> 
<li>Text to Speech Customizability. Developers can use SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) in the Cloud Gem Portal to control timbre, pacing, and language accents on their procedurally generated voices. </li> 
<li>PhysX Gem. Developers can now use Nvidia’s PhysX popular physics engine in Lumberyard. By enabling the PhysX Gem, developers can add PhysX components to their game that handle collision detection and rigid body dynamics.</li> 
<li>Editor workflow improvements, Android NDK r16 support, new physics samples, EMotion FX animation functionality in the Lumberyard Starter Game, and more.<br /> </li>

<p>Beginning today, you can use a new Amazon Route 53 Auto Naming API to update the health status of service instances manually. After you register a service instance with a new custom health check configuration, you can call the new API to mark the service instance healthy and start routing traffic to it. Alternatively, you can set the health status to &quot;unhealthy,&quot; and Route 53 will stop routing traffic to this service instance.</p> 
<p> Now you can integrate third-party health checking systems with Route 53 Auto Naming. Additionally, you have more control over traffic routing decisions to help manage new deployments. To learn more about the Amazon Route 53 Auto Naming UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus API, see our <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/overview-service-discovery.html">documentation</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/">product page</a>.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 12, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon SNS message filtering now supports both numeric and string matching. Specifically, string matching operators allow for exact, prefix, and “anything-but” comparisons, while numeric matching operators allow for exact and range comparisons. You can leverage this new set of operators to further simplify pub/sub messaging architectures by offloading to SNS message filtering logic from subscribers, as well as routing logic from publishers.</p> 
<p>Amazon SNS is a fully managed pub/sub messaging service. With Amazon SNS, you can use topics to decouple message producers and consumers, and simultaneously distribute messages to multiple subscribing endpoints, such as Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions, HTTP endpoints, email addresses, and mobile devices (SMS, push).</p> 
<p>Amazon SNS filtering operators are available in all commercial AWS regions. Get started by going to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home">AWS Management Console</a>, selecting Amazon SNS, and adding filter policies to your Amazon SNS subscriptions. You can also use the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk">AWS SDK</a> (Software Development Kit), <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#cli">AWS CLI</a> (Command Line Interface), and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/Welcome.html">SNS API</a> (Application Programming Interface). The new set of filtering operators are available at no extra charge.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 8, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) now supports Docker container health checks. This gives you more control over monitoring the health of your tasks and improves the ability of the ECS service scheduler to ensure your services are healthy.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, the ECS service scheduler relied on the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to report container health status and to restart unhealthy containers. This required you to configure your ECS Service to use a load balancer, and only supported HTTP and TCP health-checks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now, in addition to supporting ELB health checks, Amazon ECS integrates with Docker container health checks to allow you to explicitly define and monitor the health of each container. Using the HEALTHCHECK command, you can define which parameters to monitor for each container in your Task Definition. Running tasks (groups of running containers) are now assigned a health status based on the health of their essential containers, and the task's health status is integrated with the ECS service scheduler to automatically redeploy unhealthy tasks and conduct rolling-updates of services. You can check the health status of your tasks and containers in the ECS Console or with the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTasks.html" target="_blank">ECS DescribeTasks API</a>.</p> 
<p>To learn more, visit the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#container_definition_healthcheck" target="_blank">Amazon ECS documentation</a>. You can get more information about Amazon ECS on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">product page</a>.</p> 
<p>Amazon ECS is available in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), US West (N. California), Canada (Central), South America (S&atilde;o Paulo), GovCloud (US), EU (Ireland), EU (Frankfurt), EU (London), EU(Paris), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), and China (Beijing) regions.

<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/">AWS Storage Gateway</a> service expanded the set of CloudWatch Events for File Gateway to help automate hybrid cloud workflows, and now supports &quot;Requester Pays&quot; Amazon S3 buckets.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/file/">File Gateway</a> enables on-premises applications to access objects in S3 as files. File contents and metadata are cached locally for optimal performance. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/APIReference/API_RefreshCache.html" target="_blank">refresh cache</a> operation synchronizes the local cache with S3. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/monitoring-file-gateway.html#get-notification" target="_blank">new Amazon CloudWatch Event</a> occurs when a refresh cache operation finishes. Combined with file upload notification events, it enables you to automate workflows for data processing and content sharing in a hybrid cloud architecture.</p> 
<p>File Gateway can now access S3 buckets configured as &quot;<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RequesterPaysBuckets.html" target="_blank">Requester Pays</a>&quot;. Typically, bucket owners pay the cost of downloading data, but with &quot;Requester Pays&quot; enabled, the requester pays for requests and data downloads. Such buckets can be used to share public data, such as <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/hst/" target="_blank">Hubble Space Telescope observations</a>, or <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/" target="_blank">USDA Aerial Photography</a>. File Gateway caches frequently used data locally, helping requesters to reduce latency and costs.</p> 
<p>File Gateway appliances can now also run on Amazon EC2 C5/M5 instances, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/managing-gateway-file.html#cross-account-access" target="_blank">support predefined cross-account bucket access</a> using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Canned Access Control Lists (ACLs)</a>.</p> 
<p>New File Gateway appliances contain these features, and existing File Gateways will receive them automatically in the next scheduled maintenance update. You can apply the update manually through the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/home" target="_blank">management console</a> or <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html" target="_blank">service API</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/">AWS Service Catalog</a>, used by enterprises, system integrators, and managed service providers to create, govern, and manage a catalog of IT services, is announcing AutoTags. AutoTags are tags that identify the portfolio, product, and user that launched a product, and are automatically applied by AWS Service Catalog to provisioned resources.</p> 
<p>With the new AWS Service Catalog AutoTags, provisioned resources will be tagged with the unique identifiers for Portfolio, Product, and User. This provides a set of tags that reflect the AWS Service Catalog structure of portfolios, products, and users that customers have configured in the catalog. AutoTags do not count against the customer's 50-tag limit. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>AWS Service Catalog AutoTags can help provide consistent tagging for your resources, which is useful when setting AWS Budgets for a portfolio, product, or user.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 7, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>AWS Systems Manager now supports InSpec by Chef, an open source framework that helps you perform configuration compliance as code.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, you had to write compliance checks as scripts in Systems Manager to receive configuration compliance information. Now, you can use InSpec to create custom configuration compliance profiles, written in InSpec's human readable Domain Specific Language (DSL). You can also use prebuilt profiles created by the InSpec community. For example, you can run scans using these profiles to ensure instance ports are open or closed, check if a service such as Apache is running, or scan your Windows registry keys for specific properties.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>InSpec scans can be run using AWS-RunInSpecChecks, a new Systems Manager Document, and selecting a GitHub repository or an Amazon S3 bucket as the source type. You can schedule infrastructure scans to run using Systems Manager's state manager feature. After running your scans, you can view the results through Systems Manager's compliance insight by choosing compliance type Custom:InSpec.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This feature is available in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS Regions</a> where AWS Systems Manager is offered.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 2, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>It is now easy to use Amazon CloudWatch for event-driven AWS Batch workloads by adding AWS Batch as a target for Amazon CloudWatch.&nbsp; Amazon CloudWatch Events enables you to respond quickly to application availability issues or configuration changes that might impact performance or security by notifying you of AWS resource changes in near-real-time. You simply write rules to indicate which events are of interest to your application and what automated action to take when a rule matches an event. You can add AWS Batch as a target by creating an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule and specifying the AWS Batch job ARN. Once the rule matches an event, it starts the job by invoking the Batch Submit-Job API. For example, you can submit a job to AWS Batch in response to an event pattern or on a schedule using Amazon CloudWatch Events. Prior to this feature, customers were required to use services such as AWS Lambda as a workaround to take advantage of Amazon CloudWatch for their event-driven batch workloads. This feature is available in all AWS Public Regions where AWS Batch is available.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>AWS Batch is a fully managed service that automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes the workload distribution based on the volume and resource requirements of submitted jobs. It eliminates the need to install or manage batch computing software. You only pay for the AWS resources (e.g. Amazon EC2 instances) you create to store and run your batch jobs.</p> 
<p>This feature is available effective today in all AWS Regions supported by AWS Batch. AWS Batch is currently available in the following AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), US West (N.
