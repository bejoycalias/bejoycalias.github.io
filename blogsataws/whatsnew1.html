<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 12, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon Chime is introducing new, frustration-free pricing to make it easier to buy and use Amazon Chime. With this new approach to pricing, you only pay for users that host meetings, on the days they host them, while attendees remain free. Usage fees are $3.00 per user per day, with a cap of $15.00 per user per month. In addition, we are reducing the number of plans from three to two by discontinuing the Plus plan. Screen sharing and user management fees will be included with the Basic plan, which remains free. With these changes, we are simplifying our pricing, and making it easier to save money while providing access to Amazon Chime Pro features to more of your users.<br /> </p> 
<p>These changes go into effect on 1 April, 2018. For more information, please read Jeff Barr's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-usage-based-pricing-for-amazon-chime/" target="_blank">blog post</a> on this topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon Chime is a secure, real-time, communications service that simplifies video conferencing, online meetings, calls, and chat. With Amazon Chime, there are no upfront payments, and there is no infrastructure to deploy. You can try Amazon Chime for free for 30 days by visiting the <a href="https://chime.aws/trial/" target="_blank">Amazon Chime download page</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can now use Amazon Redshift Spectrum to directly query scalar JSON and Ion data types stored in external tables in Amazon S3 - without loading or transforming the data. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/spectrum/">Redshift Spectrum</a>, a feature of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/">Amazon Redshift</a>, enables you to use your existing Business Intelligence tools to analyze data stored in your Amazon S3 data lake. For example, you can now directly query JSON and Ion data, such as client weblogs, stored in S3 to gain deeper insights from the data.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 8, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) now supports Docker container health checks. This gives you more control over monitoring the health of your tasks and improves the ability of the ECS service scheduler to ensure your services are healthy.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, the ECS service scheduler relied on the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to report container health status and to restart unhealthy containers. This required you to configure your ECS Service to use a load balancer, and only supported HTTP and TCP health-checks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now, in addition to supporting ELB health checks, Amazon ECS integrates with Docker container health checks to allow you to explicitly define and monitor the health of each container. Using the HEALTHCHECK command, you can define which parameters to monitor for each container in your Task Definition. Running tasks (groups of running containers) are now assigned a health status based on the health of their essential containers, and the task's health status is integrated with the ECS service scheduler to automatically redeploy unhealthy tasks and conduct rolling-updates of services. You can check the health status of your tasks and containers in the ECS Console or with the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTasks.html" target="_blank">ECS DescribeTasks API</a>.</p> 
<p>To learn more, visit the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#container_definition_healthcheck" target="_blank">Amazon ECS documentation</a>. You can get more information about Amazon ECS on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">product page</a>.</p> 
<p>Amazon ECS is available in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), US West (N.

<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/">AWS Storage Gateway</a> service expanded the set of CloudWatch Events for File Gateway to help automate hybrid cloud workflows, and now supports &quot;Requester Pays&quot; Amazon S3 buckets.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/file/">File Gateway</a> enables on-premises applications to access objects in S3 as files. File contents and metadata are cached locally for optimal performance. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/APIReference/API_RefreshCache.html" target="_blank">refresh cache</a> operation synchronizes the local cache with S3. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/monitoring-file-gateway.html#get-notification" target="_blank">new Amazon CloudWatch Event</a> occurs when a refresh cache operation finishes. Combined with file upload notification events, it enables you to automate workflows for data processing and content sharing in a hybrid cloud architecture.</p> 
<p>File Gateway can now access S3 buckets configured as &quot;<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RequesterPaysBuckets.html" target="_blank">Requester Pays</a>&quot;. Typically, bucket owners pay the cost of downloading data, but with &quot;Requester Pays&quot; enabled, the requester pays for requests and data downloads. Such buckets can be used to share public data, such as <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/hst/" target="_blank">Hubble Space Telescope observations</a>, or <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/" target="_blank">USDA Aerial Photography</a>. File Gateway caches frequently used data locally, helping requesters to reduce latency and costs.</p> 
<p>File Gateway appliances can now also run on Amazon EC2 C5/M5 instances, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/managing-gateway-file.html#cross-account-access" target="_blank">support predefined cross-account bucket access</a> using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Canned Access Control Lists (ACLs)</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/">AWS Service Catalog</a>, used by enterprises, system integrators, and managed service providers to create, govern, and manage a catalog of IT services, is announcing AutoTags. AutoTags are tags that identify the portfolio, product, and user that launched a product, and are automatically applied by AWS Service Catalog to provisioned resources.</p> 
<p>With the new AWS Service Catalog AutoTags, provisioned resources will be tagged with the unique identifiers for Portfolio, Product, and User. This provides a set of tags that reflect the AWS Service Catalog structure of portfolios, products, and users that customers have configured in the catalog. AutoTags do not count against the customer's 50-tag limit. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>AWS Service Catalog AutoTags can help provide consistent tagging for your resources, which is useful when setting AWS Budgets for a portfolio, product, or user.

You can also use prebuilt profiles created by the InSpec community. For example, you can run scans using these profiles to ensure instance ports are open or closed, check if a service such as Apache is running, or scan your Windows registry keys for specific properties.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>InSpec scans can be run using AWS-RunInSpecChecks, a new Systems Manager Document, and selecting a GitHub repository or an Amazon S3 bucket as the source type. You can schedule infrastructure scans to run using Systems Manager's state manager feature. After running your scans, you can view the results through Systems Manager's compliance insight by choosing compliance type Custom:InSpec.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 2, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>It is now easy to use Amazon CloudWatch for event-driven AWS Batch workloads by adding AWS Batch as a target for Amazon CloudWatch.&nbsp; Amazon CloudWatch Events enables you to respond quickly to application availability issues or configuration changes that might impact performance or security by notifying you of AWS resource changes in near-real-time. You simply write rules to indicate which events are of interest to your application and what automated action to take when a rule matches an event. You can add AWS Batch as a target by creating an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule and specifying the AWS Batch job ARN. Once the rule matches an event, it starts the job by invoking the Batch Submit-Job API. For example, you can submit a job to AWS Batch in response to an event pattern or on a schedule using Amazon CloudWatch Events. Prior to this feature, customers were required to use services such as AWS Lambda as a workaround to take advantage of Amazon CloudWatch for their event-driven batch workloads. This feature is available in all AWS Public Regions where AWS Batch is available.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>AWS Batch is a fully managed service that automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes the workload distribution based on the volume and resource requirements of submitted jobs. It eliminates the need to install or manage batch computing software. You only pay for the AWS resources (e.g. Amazon EC2 instances) you create to store and run your batch jobs.</p> 
<p>This feature is available effective today in all AWS Regions supported by AWS Batch. AWS Batch is currently available in the following AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), US West (N. California), Canada (Central), EU (Ireland), EU (London), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney) and Asia Pacific (Seoul)</p>

<p>Amazon CloudWatch now allows you to use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/batch">AWS Batch</a> as an event target to run batch computing workloads. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/WhatIsCloudWatchEvents.html">Amazon CloudWatch Events</a> enables you to respond quickly to application availability issues or configuration changes that might impact performance or security by notifying you of AWS resource changes in near-real-time. You simply write rules to indicate which events are of interest to your application and what automated action to take when a rule matches an event. You can, for example, invoke AWS Lambda functions or notify an Amazon SNS topic or take an Amazon EBS volume snapshot every hour, or at intervals down to 1-minute. AWS Batch is a fully managed service that automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes the workload distribution based on the volume and resource requirements of submitted jobs. It eliminates the need to install or manage batch computing software. You only pay for the AWS resources (e.g. EC2 instances) you create to store and run your batch jobs.</p> 
<p>You can add AWS Batch as a target by creating an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule and specifying the AWS Batch job ARN.
