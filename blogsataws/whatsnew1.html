<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/real-time-insights-account-activity/">Real-Time Insights on AWS Account Activity</a> is a solution that can help you more easily monitor your AWS account activity in real-time. This solution automatically provisions the services necessary to record and visualize resource access and usage metrics for your AWS account(s). Real-Time Insights on AWS Account Activity is designed to provide a framework for visualizing metrics in real-time, allowing you to focus on adding new metrics rather than underlying infrastructure operations. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>For customers without a method to record and visualize account activity metrics, this solution can provide valuable insight into who is accessing your resources and how your resources are being used. This insight can help you make better-informed decisions that increase security and efficiency, facilitate compliance auditing, and optimize costs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The solution deploys <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/">AWS CloudTrail</a> to log account activity, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-analytics/">Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics</a> to compute metrics in real-time, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a> to durably store the computed data. The solution also features a customizable dashboard that visualizes your account activity in real-time. Metrics are calculated for create, modify, and delete API calls for more than 60 <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events-supported-services.html" target="_blank">supported AWS services</a>. For pricing details, see the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/services/">pricing webpage</a> for each AWS service you will be using in this solution. To learn more about the Real-Time Insights on AWS Account Activity, see the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/real-time-insights-account-activity/">solution webpage</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Feb 15, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Today, Amazon GameLift introduces FleetIQ and Spot instances. Spot instances offer customers access to spare AWS computing capacity at savings of up to 90% compared to On-Demand prices. You can achieve these savings while maintaining high game server availability with the use of FleetIQ, a new feature of Amazon GameLift Queues that places new sessions on game servers based on player latencies, instance prices, and Spot interruption rates.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon GameLift is a dedicated game server hosting and matchmaking solution for games. It is available in 14 AWS regions and supports all major game engines including Amazon Lumberyard, Unreal Engine, Unity, and custom C++ and C# game engines.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Feb 12, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>In December 2017, we announced that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/longer-resource-ids-in-2018-for-amazon-ec2-amazon-ebs-and-amazon-vpc/" target="_blank">Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and AWS Storage Gateway resources will have longer identifiers</a> to support the ongoing growth of Amazon Web Services. Starting today, you can opt in to using longer IDs using APIs or the AWS Management Console.</p> 
<p>From now until the end of June 2018, you can test your systems with the longer format and opt in when you are ready. After June 2018, all new resources will be created with longer IDs by default. Note that the new format will only apply to newly created resources; your existing resources won't be affected. We strongly recommend testing your systems and opting in to the longer ID format across all of your accounts before the end of June 2018.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The current format is a resource identifier followed by an 8-character string. The new format will be the same resource identifier followed by a 17-character string. For example, today, your VPC has a resource identifier like “vpc-1234abc0”. After July 2018, a new VPC will be assigned an identifier like “vpc-1234567890abcdef0”.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>More information about affected resources, testing procedures, and more can be found on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#longer-ids">EC2 FAQ page</a>.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Feb 8, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Today, Amazon GameLift introduces backfill functionality for FlexMatch, a powerful matchmaking service that enables you to match players together based on rules you define.&nbsp;Whether you choose to build your matches based on player skill, latency, or some other custom criteria, FlexMatch allows you to build robust and flexible matchmaking pipelines to suit your desired gaming experience.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With the new backfill capabilities, FlexMatch now finds players to join a game session that is already in progress, using the same custom criteria used to populate the original game session. This ensures that when a player drops from an existing multiplayer session, you can backfill the empty slot with the most appropriate new player for that match and deliver a gaming experience that is always fast, full and fun for your players.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon GameLift’s FlexMatch lets you configure custom matchmaking rule sets so you can automatically group players together in a way that strikes your ideal balance between match quality and player wait time. FlexMatch automatically routes grouped players into a game session queue, which places the match in the AWS region that best balances low player latency and high server utilization. To ensure players are efficiently placed into game sessions, you can also configure FlexMatch to automatically expand matching criteria if wait time crosses a custom threshold so that players can quickly join the next best game.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon GameLift is a dedicated game server hosting and matchmaking solution for games. It is available in 14 AWS regions and supports all major game engines including Amazon Lumberyard, Unreal Engine, Unity, and custom C++ and C# game engines.

Using SSML tags, you can customize and control aspects of speech, such as pronunciation, volume, and speech rate.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can use SSML with Amazon Lex chatbots in the US-East (Northern Virginia) <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS region</a> where the Amazon Lex and Amazon Connect services are available. To learn more about Amazon Connect support for SSML, please see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/userguide/text-to-speech.html">Using Text-to-Speech with Amazon Connect</a>. There are no additional charges to use SSML to customize your voice chatbot. You can find out more about Amazon Connect, a self-service, cloud <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-a-contact-center/">contact center</a>, by visiting the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/connect/">Amazon Connect website</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Feb 8, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>You can now define a response for your <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lex">Amazon Lex</a> chatbot directly from <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lex/">the AWS Management Console</a>. A response consists of messages dynamically selected from a group of pre-defined messages, populated by the developer. Messages in these message groups can be simple text, or you can use custom markup. In addition, you can also display <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/ex-resp-card.html">a response card</a> as part of the response. The responses capability simplifies building dynamic conversations with Amazon Lex.&nbsp; In addition, you can use Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) in a text response.</p> 
<p>To define responses in Amazon Lex, by example, if we are building a chatbot that takes car and hotel reservations, you might build three message groups. The first message group could contain different ways the bot could greet the user: “Hello”, “Hi”, “Greetings”. The second message group could contain the different forms of introduction: “My name is ReservationBot”, “I am ReservationBot”, “This is ReservationBot”. And the third message group could communicate the capabilities: “I can help with car rentals and hotel reservations”, “You can do your car rentals and hotel reservations with me”, “Currently I can support car rentals and hotel reservations.” Amazon Lex can use one message from each of these message groups to dynamically build a response in a conversation. A sample response, then, would be, “Hello! My name is ReservationBot. I can help with car rentals and hotel reservations”.</p> 
<p>In addition to supporting SSML in speech response, Amazon Lex now supports SSML in a text response. You can use SSML response as input to a Text-to- Speech (TTS) engine to personalize conversations with end users. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/userguide/text-to-speech.html" target="_blank">Amazon Connect customers can now use SSML</a> when leveraging an Amazon Lex chatbot as part of their contact center experience to control aspects of speech, such as pronunciation, volume, and speech rate.<br /> </p> 
<p>The responses and SSML functionalities for Amazon Lex are available today in the US East (N. Virginia) and EU West (Ireland) AWS Regions. For more information please refer to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/gs2-build-and-test.html">the Amazon Lex documentation</a>.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Feb 8, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon DynamoDB encryption at rest helps you secure your application data in Amazon DynamoDB tables further using AWS-managed encryption keys stored in AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Encryption at rest is fully transparent to the user with all DynamoDB queries working seamlessly on encrypted data. With this new capability, it has never been easier to use DynamoDB for security-sensitive applications with strict encryption compliance and regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Encryption at rest expands on DynamoDB’s existing security controls i.e., data protection and security using TLS endpoints for encryption-in-transit, a client-side library for end-to-end encryption, and fine-grained access control using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Last year, AWS added VPC Endpoints for DynamoDB to ensure your VPC and DynamoDB connection remains closed and isolated from the Internet, and to enable restricting access to DynamoDB only from your authorized applications.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>DynamoDB encryption at rest is generally available in EU (Ireland), US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), and US West (Oregon) at no extra cost (KMS encryption key usage charges apply). With today’s release, encryption at rest is available for new DynamoDB tables. Furthermore, backups of encrypted DynamoDB tables are also fully encrypted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments address the high availability requirements of enterprise-grade production workloads. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/">Amazon RDS for SQL Server</a> now supports Multi-AZ in the Asia Pacific (Singapore) region. This new option leverages SQL Server Mirroring technology, with additional improvements.</p> 
<p>AWS Availability Zones (AZs) are physically separate locations with independent infrastructure engineered to be insulated from failures in other Availability Zones. The Multi-AZ deployment option provides enhanced availability and data durability by automatically replicating database updates between two AZs.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can create SQL Server database instances with the Multi-AZ option or modify existing instances. Amazon RDS will automatically provision a primary database in one AZ and maintain a synchronous &quot;standby&quot; replica in a different AZ. In the event of planned database maintenance or unplanned service disruption, Amazon RDS will automatically fail over the database to the up-to-date replica so that database operations can resume quickly without any manual intervention.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon RDS for SQL Server makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale SQL Server deployments in the cloud.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Feb 8, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Today, AWS announced the ability to filter load balancers and target groups by tags in the Elastic Load Balancing Console. Tag-based filtering enables you to view only the load balancers and target groups that you are responsible for monitoring. It also reduces chances of making configuration changes to a wrong load balancer or target group not owned by your group. For example, if you have tagged your development stage load balancers as Stage: Dev and production stage load balancers as Stage: Prod, you can filter on tag Stage: Prod to view only the production stage load balancers.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Tag based filtering is available today in all AWS regions. To learn more about tagging, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-tags.html" target="_blank">Tags for Your Application Load Balancer</a>.</p>

<p>Beginning today, you have more options to securely connect your devices to AWS IoT Core. You can use MQTT with certificate based client authentication on port 443. Previously this combination of protocol and authentication mechanism was only supported on port 8883.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Corporate firewalls and home routers often block inbound and outbound traffic on all ports except port 443 by default, which is the standard port for HTTPS (i.e. internet) traffic. This is done as a security measure to limit the attack surface for possible cyber attacks. With this update, we enable you to deploy your IoT devices with minimal network and firewall changes, while still using certificate based authentication. This is especially beneficial for those who need to deploy devices into environments where they do not control the IT infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Feb 6, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>AWS Systems Manager now allows you to specify repositories (repos) for Linux in the patch baseline, apply non-OS security updates through patching, and patch SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, you could only use repos configured on the instance. Now, you can define in the patch baseline which repos to download packages from. This gives you more control over where patches and updates are downloaded during patching operations, providing patching consistency for all of your instances. The repos can be configured in the patch baseline, which defines the patches that are approved for installation on your instances. Custom repos that are defined in a patch baseline are used only during patching operations and do not change the instance configuration.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can also now apply non-OS security updates as part of patching operations. This gives you the ability to perform application patching on Linux.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Finally, Systems Manager now supports patching operations for SLES version 12 and higher. This allows you to use one patching solution for more of your mixed Linux environment.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>AWS Systems Manager is available in US East (Northern Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), US West (Northern California), Canada (Central), South America (Sao Paulo), EU (Frankfurt), EU (Ireland), Europe (London), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), and Asia Pacific (Sydney) public AWS regions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beginning today, you can use the Amazon Route 53 Auto Naming APIs to create CNAME records when you register instances of your microservices, and your microservices can discover the CNAMEs by querying DNS for the service name. Additionally, you can use the Amazon Route 53 Auto Naming APIs to create Route 53 alias records that route traffic to Amazon Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now you can register your service instances using Amazon Route 53 Auto Naming APIs and specify settings for A, AAAA, CNAME, and SRV records, and for Route 53 alias records that route traffic to an ELB load balancer.
