<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 13, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Today, we announced support for an ODBC driver for Amazon Athena.</p> 
<p>With the availability of a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-odbc.html">new ODBC driver</a>, you can now connect popular business intelligence tools to Athena. This allows you to report and visualize all of your data in S3 with the tools of your choice. In addition to the ODBC driver, Customers can now connect to Amazon Athena using a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-jdbc.html">JDBC driver</a>, an <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">API</a> and via the AWS Console.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 13, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>We are announcing Amazon EC2 Elastic GPUs support for OpenGL 4.2, and availability in the EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo) regions. To activate OpenGL 4.2 support for existing Elastic GPUs, simply stop and start your instances, and a new driver will be automatically installed in your instance to support OpenGL 4.2.</p> 
<p>Elastic GPUs allow you to easily attach low-cost graphics acceleration to a wide range of EC2 instances over the network. Simply choose an instance with the right amount of compute, memory, and storage for your application, and then use Elastic GPUs to add the GPU resources needed to accelerate the graphics performance of your application for a fraction of the cost of standalone graphics instances.</p> 
<p>In addition to the regions launched today, Amazon EC2 Elastic GPUs are already available in the US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), and EU (Ireland) regions. For more information about Elastic GPUs, visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/elastic-gpus/">Amazon EC2 Elastic GPUs</a> page. To get started, visit <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/elastic-gpus/getting-started/">Getting Started with Elastic GPUs</a>.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 13, 2017</span> </p> 
<p> Starting today, Amazon WorkDocs makes it easier to share files with contractors, vendors, and other third parties in a quick, easy, and secure way. WorkDocs users can now collaborate with third parties by selecting “Share by invite” from the file drop-down menu, and entering a valid email address.</p> 
<p>The recipient creates a <i>guest user</i> account the first time they log in to view the file, and can view any files shared with them. There is no charge for <i>guest users</i>, and administrators can upgrade a <i>guest user</i> to a standard&nbsp;<i>user</i> at any time. Administrators control who can invite <i>guest users</i>, can disable <i>guest users</i> at any time, and can audit all <i>guest user</i> activity in the Activity Feed.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This feature is available today in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS Regions</a> where WorkDocs is offered. To learn more about WorkDocs, or to start your 30-day trial, please visit <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/workdocs/">Amazon WorkDocs</a>.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 10, 2017</span> </p> 
<p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet.html" target="_blank">Spot Fleet</a> now integrates with Elastic Load Balancing to enable you to attach one or more load balancers to a Spot Fleet. By attaching a load balancer Spot Fleet automatically registers the instances it launches with the load balancer or target groups, the load balancer then distributes incoming traffic across your instances. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, if you wanted to attach instances launched by Spot Fleet to a load balancer you had to write and manage custom code. Now you can provide the load balancers when you create a Spot Fleet and it will automatically attach instances launched on your behalf to your load balancer(s).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones. Elastic Load Balancing offers three types of load balancers that all feature the high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security necessary to make your applications fault tolerant. Elastic Load Balancing is supported today in all regions where Spot Fleet is available. For more information, click&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> 
<p>Also launching today is the availability of 0 instance Spot Fleets. You can now modify the target capacity of a Spot Fleet down to 0, allowing you to maintain a single Spot Fleet even if there are periods where you require no Spot instance capacity at all. Previously, the minimum target capacity was 1 requiring you to cancel a Spot Fleet you no longer needed capacity. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can get started with Spot Fleet using the <a href="https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2sp/v1/spot/home?region=us-east-2" target="_blank">AWS Management Console</a>, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/request-spot-fleet.html" target="_blank">AWS Command Line Interface</a> (CLI), or <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotFleet.html" target="_blank">AWS SDK</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 10, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Starting today, you can monitor your Amazon Redshift, Amazon RDS, and Amazon ElastiCache reservations, in addition to your Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances (RI), using the RI Utilization report, available in AWS Cost Explorer.</p> 
<p>The RI Utilization report visualizes the purchasing account’s reservation utilization (i.e., the percentage of reserved hours used against the purchased reservation) and provides additional reservation-related information (e.g., hours unused). To analyze utilization for a specific reservation, or set of reservations, you can use a variety of filtering dimensions, such as AWS service, instance or node type, region, and platform.

<b id="Amazon_ElastiCache_for_Redis_introduces_dynamic_addition_and_removal_of_shards_while_continuing_to_serve_workloads"> <a name="Amazon_ElastiCache_for_Redis_introduces_dynamic_addition_and_removal_of_shards_while_continuing_to_serve_workloads"> Amazon ElastiCache for Redis introduces dynamic addition and removal of shards while continuing to serve workloads</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 9, 2017</span> </p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis/">Amazon ElastiCache for Redis</a> introduces Online Cluster Resizing to add and remove shards from a running cluster. You can now dynamically scale-out or scale-in your Redis cluster workloads to adapt to changes in demand. ElastiCache will resize the cluster and redistribute hash slots uniformly across the new shard configuration, all while the cluster continues to stay online and serve requests. Additionally, for optimized processing, you can also rebalance a cluster and uniformly distribute the slot space, without changing the number of shards.<br /> </p> 
<p>Below are the key highlights of the announcement:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Right size and improve efficiency</b> – By dynamically scaling-out and scaling-in a cluster, ElastiCache eliminates the need to overprovision clusters based on peak demand, allowing you to right size clusters, improve efficiency, and reduce costs.<br /> </li> 
<li><b>Online experience</b> – Cluster resizing in ElastiCache is designed to be a fully online experience which ensures availability, performance, durability and data consistency, throughout slot migration.&nbsp; 
<ul> 
<li><b>Availability</b> – Unlike open source Redis, ElastiCache cluster resizing is designed to run multi-threaded operations at the source shard, allowing slot migration to run on a separate thread from the main I/O thread. This allows ElastiCache to deliver a fully online experience and enables the cluster to serve incoming I/O requests while resizing is in progress.&nbsp;</li> 
<li><b>Redis command support</b> – ElastiCache uses atomic slot migration instead of the atomic key migration used by open source Redis. When a key is migrated to the target shard, the source shard maintains a copy and retains ownership of the key, until the entire slot and all its keys are migrated. While this improves performance, it also allows you to benefit from full Redis API coverage, including operations such as multi-key commands, transactions, and LUA scripts.</li> 
<li><b>No Client side changes needed </b>– The enhanced slot distribution used in cluster resizing workflow is compliant with Redis cluster client behavior and does not require any application changes. ElastiCache retains cluster 
<g class="gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" data-gr-id="20">
end points 
</g>, enabling you to continue using existing clients without any changes.</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li><b>Fully managed</b> – ElastiCache provides a full-managed experience where you can initiate cluster resizing as a one-click workflow. Online Cluster Resizing is hardened for better performance, fault tolerance and robustness, eliminating any need for manual intervention to maintain data consistency and data durability.&nbsp;</li> 
<li><b>Integrated experience</b> – Online Cluster Resizing comes with support for API, 
<g class="gr_ gr_31 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" data-gr-id="31">
CLI 
</g> and AWS Management Console, along with end-to-end monitoring and reporting, and familiar tagging capability.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>These capabilities are available with the latest version, Amazon ElastiCache for Redis 3.2.10, at no additional charge, and maintain open source Redis compatibility.<br /> </p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 9, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Control the tonal quality of Amazon Polly’s voice output with the new vocal-tract-length Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) tag. Adjusting the “vocal tract length” will modify the tone quality, called timbre, to make a voice sound characteristically different without adjusting rate and pitch. This tag can be used with any of the voices in the Amazon Polly Text-to-Speech portfolio to produce many variations for a single voice.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com//d1.awsstatic.com/Polly/Timbre_Sample1.1e7fd4dbc93c78a1f738f2cc41bf097e5a15f19f.wav">&lt;Listen to sample&gt;</a>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You now have more options to customize the Amazon Polly voices – editing and adjusting timbre, rate and pitch to create new personas to fit your needs. Try the new timbre modification control effect through the Amazon Polly console, or visit the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/supported-ssml.html#vocaltractlength-tag" target="_blank">Amazon Polly documentation</a> for more information around SSML tags.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 9, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon Inspector is pleased to announce the addition of native severity data for the Common Vulnerabilities &amp; Exposures (CVE), and CIS Benchmarks rule packages, along with support for security assessments on CentOS Enterprise Linux 7.4 within Amazon EC2. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Prior to this release, Amazon Inspector provided a normalized severity rating for security findings identified by Amazon Inspector. Due to the differences between the severity ratings for rule packages like CVE and CIS Benchmarks, Amazon Inspector transforms these native severities into a standardized 4 tier severity scale of High, Medium, Low, and Informational that is used for all findings regardless of rules package. We will now also expose the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) severity and CVSS vector information associated with all CVE findings. For CIS Benchmarks, we have added the information for the CIS Benchmark Weight, which details whether the benchmark is considered as part of the scoring criteria for the hardening guideline used.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In addition to these findings data enhancements, you can now run assessments for Common Vulnerabilities &amp; Exposures (CVE), Amazon Security Best Practices, and Runtime Behavior Analysis on the most recent version of CentOS Enterprise Linux. To run security assessments, simply install the Amazon Inspector AWS Agent on the desired CentOS-based EC2 instance, configure your assessment in the Amazon Inspector console, and run your assessment.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 9, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Today AWS Direct Connect has landed sites in five cities – Denver, Phoenix, Madrid, Helsinki and Chennai. In the US, CoreSite DE1, Denver and phoenixNAP, Phoenix bring the total AWS Direct Connect sites in the country to 28. With global access enabled for AWS Direct Connect, these sites can reach AWS resources in any global AWS Region. In the AWS Management Console, Denver will be found under its home region of US West (Oregon) and Phoenix will be found in US West (N.California). In Europe, ITConic Madrid 2, now an Equinix datacenter, marks the second AWS Direct Connect site in Madrid and Equinix HE6, Helsinki is the first AWS Direct Connect presence in Finland. Both these sites, Madrid and Helsinki, will be found under the EU Central (Frankfurt) AWS Region in the console. In Asia, India gets its first site outside Mumbai with STT GDC Chennai VSB in Chennai, which will be found in its home region of Asia Pacific (Mumbai). &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Customers in these cities can now establish a dedicated network connection from their premise to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections. Connections are always made to a particular Direct Connect location, and can run at either 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps, or work with a partner to connect at speeds less than 1G.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Please see our AWS website for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/details/">details</a> on our locations and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/pricing/">pricing</a>.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 8, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>We are pleased to announce that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/#application">Application Auto Scaling</a> now supports scheduled scaling, which makes it possible to scale resources at specific preset times or intervals. Application Auto Scaling allows you to automatically scale resources for AWS services beyond Amazon EC2, including Amazon ECS, Amazon EC2 Spot Fleets, Amazon EMR Clusters, AppStream 2.0 fleets, and Amazon DynamoDB.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Scheduled scaling allows you to pre-provision adequate capacity for anticipated demand and then reduce your provisioned capacity as demand lulls. For example, if the traffic to your web application consistently increases each morning, remains high through the day, and decreases each evening, you can use scheduled scaling to add capacity to your resources in the morning, such as increasing your DynamoDB provisioned capacity, while allowing capacity to scale-in later in the day.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Scheduled scaling for Application Auto Scaling is available in all commercial regions. You can start using it today using the AWS <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ApplicationAutoScaling/latest/APIReference/API_ScheduledAction.html" target="_blank">Application Programming Interface (API)</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/application-autoscaling/put-scheduled-action.html" target="_blank">Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>.

<p>Customers can now privately access AWS services from their Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), without using public IPs, and without requiring the traffic to traverse across the Internet. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>AWS PrivateLink is a purpose-built technology designed for customers to access AWS services in a highly available and scalable manner, while keeping all the network traffic within the AWS network. When you create endpoints for AWS services powered by PrivateLink, these service endpoints will appear as Elastic Network Interface (ENI) with private IPs in your VPCs. PrivateLink removes the need of whitelisting public IPs, or managing the Internet connectivity using an Internet Gateway, Network Address Translation (NAT) devices, or firewall proxies to connect to AWS services. AWS services available on PrivateLink also support private connectivity over AWS Direct Connect, so that applications in your own data centers will be able to connect to AWS services via the Amazon private network using the service endpoints. <br /> </p> 
<p>AWS services currently available on AWS PrivateLink include Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Kinesis Streams, Service Catalog and EC2 Systems Manager, and support for additional AWS services will be added in the coming months.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 6, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>You now have a number of new Amazon S3 features to augment data protection and simplify compliance.</p> 
<p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/crr.html" target="_blank">Cross-Region Replication</a> (CRR) can now replicate storage encrypted by the AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS) across AWS regions for low-latency data access, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>CRR can also help you protect against malicious or accidental deletion by maintaining a pristine copy of your data in a separate account with a different ownership stack. CRR now supports ownership overwrite, which allows you to grant access to a different destination bucket owner and revoke access permission on the replicated objects from the source bucket owner. This provides separate ownership of your data between source and destination account when you set up CRR across accounts.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It is now easier to ensure encryption of all new objects and monitor and report on their encryption status. Default Encryption is a bucket-level setting that automatically encrypt objects when they are stored in an S3 bucket using server-side encryption with S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS KMS managed keys (SSE-KMS). <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-inventory.html" target="_blank">S3 Inventory</a> reports now include encryption status in its list of objects and their metadata. This is a scheduled report provided on a daily or weekly basis for a bucket or prefix. The addition of encryption status in S3 inventory allows you to see how objects are encrypted for compliance auditing or other purposes. You can also encrypt S3 Inventory with SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The AWS console now highlights all publicly-accessible S3 buckets. Bucket Permissions Check will display the source for the public access (bucket policy, bucket ACLs, or both). In addition, when you change bucket policy or bucket ACLs, S3 console will analyze them and alert you if those changes will enable public read and write access on the bucket.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These new features are available in all commercial regions except AWS China (Beijing).

<p>Previously, the AWS Price List API only returned product pricing information at the region and AWS service levels, but has been enhanced to return pricing information filtered across a wide array of product dimensions. You can now build highly-specific requests that return targeted pricing information; for example, prices for all EC2 instances in the AWS Asia Pacific (Mumbai) region with 64 vCPUs and 256 GB of memory, where SQL Server Enterprise comes pre-installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amazon EC2 Systems Manager now supports inventory collection from Windows Registry,&nbsp;Windows services, roles and features enabled in Windows Server, and Windows and Linux file metadata such as when a file is created, modified, or accessed.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, you had to write your own scripts to collect metadata from Windows Registry, Windows services, roles and features enabled in Windows Server, and file metadata. Now, Systems Manager will automatically collect metadata from these types, giving you more options for enabling IT governance and compliance scenarios such as application asset management, license tracking, and file integrity monitoring. For example, you can determine if and when unauthorized files were installed on your instance and when they were last accessed, or you can find applications even if they were installed without an installer.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon EC2 Systems Manager is available in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">all commercial AWS regions and AWS GovCloud</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 6, 2017</span> </p> 
<p> In September 2016, we introduced Convertible RIs which provide customers with the flexibility to change an RI’s instance type, OS, tenancy or payment option during its term. Today, we are announcing a few enhancements to Convertible RIs.</p> 
<p> First, you can now purchase Convertible RIs for a 1 year term. Until today, Convertible RIs were only available with a 3 year term. While customers have told us they like the flexibility of Convertible RIs, some have said that they want to make a shorter commitment. Now customers can get the flexibility of Convertible RIs with a shorter term length.</p> 
<p>Additionally, we have improved the Convertible RI exchange process by adding the ability for customers to exchange a portion of an RI as well as merge the value from multiple RIs for use in a single exchange. These enhancements provide more flexibility when exchanging your Convertible RIs.<br /> </p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 6, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>AWS launches new billing preferences that give you control over how AWS credits and RI discounts are shared among the accounts in your organization.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Historically, AWS has maximized customer savings by applying credits and RI discounts first to the account that owned the credit or RI lease and then distributing the remainder, if any, to&nbsp;qualifying usage incurred by accounts in the same organization. While this approach had the potential of lowering the overall bill, customers were unable to control if, and how, discounts were applied across&nbsp;organizational lines.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To provide greater flexibility, customers can now disable AWS credit sharing across all accounts in their organization. This ensures that only the account that owns a credit, or has previously redeemed a credit, receives the associated benefit.&nbsp;Similarly, you can now disable RI discount sharing across your organization to ensure that only the RI owner receives any associated discounts. You can also designate a set of accounts for which RI discount sharing is disabled, while continuing to share RI discounts among the rest of the accounts in your organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Device and init flags can now be specified in task definitions for Docker containers managed by Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#add-host-device-to-container-device" target="_blank">device flag</a> enables containers to attach to external devices without using privileged mode. Previously, to mount a device to a Docker container required starting the container in privileged mode. Now, you can specify devices in the Amazon ECS task definition, allowing containers to mount devices such as EBS volumes.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#exit-status" target="_blank">init flag</a> runs an init process as PID 1 in the container. Previously, if certain containerized processes did not exit nicely, they could continue to run – incurring unneeded utilization and cost. Now, you can specify the Docker init parameter in the Amazon ECS task definition. This ensures the init process is the parent for all processes inside a container, and can terminate processes that have finished execution, but are still running.</p>

<p>Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) now allows applications running in containers to directly access metadata about their environment.<br /> </p> 
<p>Previously, if an application running in a container managed by Amazon ECS required access to information about its environment, you needed to manually call this metadata using the Docker or Amazon ECS introspection API, and inject it into the container.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now, applications running in containers managed by Amazon ECS can directly query environmental metadata such as the Docker container and Docker image name and id, the container’s networking configuration and port mapping, as well as the ECS Task’s and Container Instance Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This makes applications running on Amazon ECS environment-aware, and enables them to self-register in Service Discovery and Configuration Management solutions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>ElastiCache for Redis uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="_blank">Advanced Encryption Standard</a> (AES)-512 symmetric keys to encrypt data on disk. The Redis backups stored in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> are encrypted with Server Side Encryption (SSE) using AES-256 symmetric keys. ElastiCache for Redis uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" target="_blank">Transport Layer Security</a> (TLS) to encrypt data in transit. It uses the Redis AUTH token that you provide at the time of Redis cluster creation to authenticate the Redis commands coming from clients.

Today, we launched two new features that provide explanations of the anomalies, making it easy for you to perform root cause analysis. You can learn which fields in your data lead to high anomaly scores and identify trends associated with the anomaly.</p> 
<p>Kinesis Analytics uses <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/analytics/whitepaper-real-time-anomaly-detection/">Random Cut Forest algorithm</a> to analyze one or more numeric fields and generate scores to identify anomalies in data streams. When records in your data stream have a large number of fields, it can be difficult to manually determine which fields lead to high anomaly scores, especially when the data is large, moves fast, and changes frequently. Kinesis Analytics now provides real-time explanations of the anomaly scores using attribution and directionality. Attribution explains the contribution of input fields to the overall score, and directionality provides information about the trends such as dips and spikes in each field. For more information and sample code, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/sqlref/sqlrf-random-cut-forest-with-explanation.html" target="_blank">Random Cut Forest with Explanations</a> in the Amazon Kinesis Analytics SQL Reference.</p> 
<p>Kinesis Analytics is the easiest way to process streaming data in real time with SQL without having to learn new programming languages or processing frameworks. Kinesis Analytics enables you to query streaming data or build entire streaming applications using SQL, so that you can gain actionable insights and respond to your business and customer needs promptly. Kinesis Analytics is available in the US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and EU (Ireland) regions.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 2, 2017</span> </p> 
<p> You can now choose from two types of API endpoints when creating REST APIs and custom domains with Amazon API Gateway. A regional API endpoint is a new type of endpoint that is accessed from the same AWS region in which your REST API is deployed. This helps you reduce request latency when API requests originate from the same region as your REST API. Additionally, you can now choose to associate your own Amazon CloudFront distribution with the regional API endpoint. The second type of API endpoint is the edge-optimized API. Edge-optimized APIs are endpoints that are accessed through a CloudFront distribution that is created and managed by API Gateway. Previously, edge-optimized APIs were the default option for creating APIs with API Gateway.</p> 
<p> To get started, create a new REST API using the Amazon API Gateway console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs and APIs. You can also migrate existing REST APIs and custom domains to a regional API endpoint. Visit our <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/create-regional-api.html">documentation</a> to learn more about this feature.</p> 
<p> This feature is now available in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), US West (N. California), Canada (Central), South America (S&atilde;o Paulo), EU (Ireland), EU (Frankfurt), EU (London), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Seoul), and Asia Pacific (Mumbai) AWS regions.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 1, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Apache MXNet version 0.12 is now available with two new important features—support for NVIDIA Volta GPUs, and support for Sparse Tensors.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Support for NVIDIA Volta GPU Architecture</b></p> 
<p>The MXNet v0.12 release adds support for NVIDIA Volta V100 GPUs, enabling customers to train convolutional neural networks up to 3.5 times faster than on the Pascal GPUs. The Volta GPU architecture introduces Tensor Cores, which allow mixed-precision training. With mixed precision of Tensor Cores, users can achieve optimal training performance without sacrificing accuracy by using FP16 for most of the layers of a network, and higher precision data types only when necessary. You can take advantage of Volta Tensor Cores to enable FP16 training in MXNet by passing a simple command.</p> 
<p>Recently we announced a new set of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ai/announcing-new-aws-deep-learning-ami-for-amazon-ec2-p3-instances/#more-2093" target="_blank">AWS Deep Learning AMIs</a>, which come pre-installed with various deep learning frameworks including MXNet v0.12, optimized for the NVIDIA Volta V100 GPUs in the Amazon EC2 P3 instance family. You can start with just one click from the AWS Marketplace or follow this <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ai/get-started-with-deep-learning-using-the-aws-deep-learning-ami/" target="_blank">step-by-step guide</a> to get started with your first <a href="http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/tutorials/index.html" target="_blank">notebook</a>.</p> 
<p><b>Sparse Tensor Support<br /> <br /> </b>MXNet v0.12 adds support for sparse tensors to efficiently store and compute tensors allowing developers to perform sparse matrix operations in a storage and compute-efficient manner and train deep learning models faster. This release supports two major sparse data formats–Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) and Row Sparse (RSP). The CSR format is optimized to represent matrices with large number of columns where each row has only a few non-zero elements. The RSP format is optimized to represent matrices with huge number of rows where most of the row slices are completely zeros. This release enables sparse support on CPU for most commonly used operators such as matrix dot product and element-wise operators. Sparse support for more operators will be added in future releases.</p>

<b id="AWS_Direct_Connect_Enables_Global_Access"> <a name="AWS_Direct_Connect_Enables_Global_Access"> AWS Direct Connect Enables Global Access</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 1, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>AWS Direct Connect provides private, high bandwidth connectivity between customer networks and AWS Cloud. The traffic sent over AWS Direct Connect connection stays within the AWS private network instead of traversing the public internet.<br /> </p> 
<p>Today, we are pleased to announce multiple new features for AWS Direct Connect. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Global Access for Virtual Private Cloud</b>:&nbsp;To enable global access to customers’ Amazon VPCs, AWS Direct Connect is announcing Direct Connect Gateway, a new feature to allow customers using any AWS Direct Connect Location to use their Direct Connect connections to access any Virtual Private Cloud deployed in any AWS Regions (except AWS China Region). In addition, each Direct Connect Gateway will enable association with one or more Amazon VPCs. Using Direct Connect Gateway, you do not need to have connections in multiple AWS Regions to access your Amazon VPCs in those AWS Regions, and use one (or more) private virtual interface to communicate with multiple Amazon VPCs across any AWS Regions (except AWS China Region).</p> 
<p><b>Global Access for AWS Public Services</b>:&nbsp;To provide global access to Amazon’s publicly routable services, AWS Direct Connect is expanding public inter-region access service at global scale. AWS Direct Connect customers in any AWS Direct Connect location can create public virtual interface to receive Amazon’s global IP routes, and access Amazon’s publicly routable services in any AWS Regions (except AWS China Region). With Global Public Access, you can now access all of Amazon’s public services using newly created AWS Direct Connect public virtual interfaces amplifying the value of your AWS Direct Connect connection.</p> 
<p><b>New Data Transfer Out pricing structure</b>:&nbsp;Effective immediately, customers will be able to determine the Data Transfer Out pricing based on the location of the workload (AWS Region) and the location of the Direct Connect location. With updated data transfer out pricing structure, you can select any AWS Direct Connect location out of our constantly growing locations across the world that best meets your needs.&nbsp;Please visit <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/pricing/">AWS Direct Connect Pricing</a>.</p> 
<p>All new features are generally available in all public AWS Regions (Except AWS China Region), including AWS GovCloud (US).
