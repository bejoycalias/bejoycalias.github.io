<b id="Amazon_EC2_Systems_Manager_Adds_New_Inventory_Types"> <a name="Amazon_EC2_Systems_Manager_Adds_New_Inventory_Types"> Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Adds New Inventory Types</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 6, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon EC2 Systems Manager now supports inventory collection from Windows Registry,&nbsp;Windows services, roles and features enabled in Windows Server, and Windows and Linux file metadata such as when a file is created, modified, or accessed.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, you had to write your own scripts to collect metadata from Windows Registry, Windows services, roles and features enabled in Windows Server, and file metadata. Now, Systems Manager will automatically collect metadata from these types, giving you more options for enabling IT governance and compliance scenarios such as application asset management, license tracking, and file integrity monitoring. For example, you can determine if and when unauthorized files were installed on your instance and when they were last accessed, or you can find applications even if they were installed without an installer.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon EC2 Systems Manager is available in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">all commercial AWS regions and AWS GovCloud</a>. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>For more information about Systems Manager Inventory, visit our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/systems-manager/inventory/">Product Page</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-inventory-about.html" target="_blank">Documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<b id="AWS_CloudFormation_Increases_Stack_Instance_Limits_for_StackSets"> <a name="AWS_CloudFormation_Increases_Stack_Instance_Limits_for_StackSets"> AWS CloudFormation Increases Stack Instance Limits for StackSets</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 6, 2017</span> </p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/details/">AWS CloudFormation</a> has increased the number of stack instances you can create per StackSet to manage your AWS resources. Previously, you could create maximum of 50 stack instances per StackSet. Now, you can create a maximum of 500 stack instances per StackSet allowing you to provision more stack instances across accounts and regions from a single template with a single operation.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>AWS CloudFormation StackSets is available in the following regions: US East (Ohio), US EAST (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), EU (Frankfurt), EU (Ireland), EU (London), and South America (S&atilde;o Paulo).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To learn more about StackSets please visit our AWS CloudFormation <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-protect-stacks.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 6, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Just last week we announced our 100th Point of Presence, today Amazon CloudFront introduces a brand new city into its network with the launch of its first Edge Location in Palermo, Italy. We now have two Edge Locations in Italy, with the other being in Milan. Our network now has 101 Points of Presence comprised of 90 Edge Locations and 11 Regional Edge Caches. The addition of Palermo, Italy as a new city is the first of many new network expansions to be announced over the coming months.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 6, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>AWS launches new billing preferences that give you control over how AWS credits and RI discounts are shared among the accounts in your organization.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Historically, AWS has maximized customer savings by applying credits and RI discounts first to the account that owned the credit or RI lease and then distributing the remainder, if any, to&nbsp;qualifying usage incurred by accounts in the same organization. While this approach had the potential of lowering the overall bill, customers were unable to control if, and how, discounts were applied across&nbsp;organizational lines.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To provide greater flexibility, customers can now disable AWS credit sharing across all accounts in their organization. This ensures that only the account that owns a credit, or has previously redeemed a credit, receives the associated benefit.&nbsp;Similarly, you can now disable RI discount sharing across your organization to ensure that only the RI owner receives any associated discounts. You can also designate a set of accounts for which RI discount sharing is disabled, while continuing to share RI discounts among the rest of the accounts in your organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To get started, refer to the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/useconsolidatedbilling-credits.html" target="_blank">AWS Credits</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/ri-behavior.html" target="_blank">Reserved Instances</a> pages in the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-what-is.html" target="_blank">Billing and Cost Management</a> user guide.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 3, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon CloudWatch is excited to announce that you can now bookmark your critical CloudWatch dashboards and quickly view them when needed. With this launch, a new “Favorites” section has been added to the sidebar in CloudWatch console. You can add any of your CloudWatch dashboards to the Favorites and quickly access them from the any other AWS regions. If you rename one of your bookmarked dashboards, the new name is automatically reflected in the Favorites. There is no additional charge for using Favorites. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>This feature is available in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS Public Regions</a> except Beijing [cn-north-1] region.

<b id="Deploy_Pivotal_Cloud_Foundry_on_the_AWS_Cloud_with_New_Quick_Start"> <a name="Deploy_Pivotal_Cloud_Foundry_on_the_AWS_Cloud_with_New_Quick_Start"> Deploy Pivotal Cloud Foundry on the AWS Cloud with New Quick Start</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 3, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>This new Quick Start automatically deploys Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), a cloud-native platform for deploying and operating modern enterprise applications, on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With PCF on AWS, you can deploy and run your Spring or .NET apps in the cloud, with PCF handling complex operational tasks. The PCF environment on AWS provides built-in monitoring, logging, rapid scaling, and four levels of high availability. You can also use the PCF Service Broker for AWS to enhance your applications with AWS services such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Quick Start is automated by AWS CloudFormation templates that you can customize during launch. You can choose from two deployment sizes: a Starter deployment that you can add more capacity to later, or a Multi-AZ deployment that’s designed for near production-grade use.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 2, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Device and init flags can now be specified in task definitions for Docker containers managed by Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#add-host-device-to-container-device" target="_blank">device flag</a> enables containers to attach to external devices without using privileged mode. Previously, to mount a device to a Docker container required starting the container in privileged mode. Now, you can specify devices in the Amazon ECS task definition, allowing containers to mount devices such as EBS volumes.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#exit-status" target="_blank">init flag</a> runs an init process as PID 1 in the container. Previously, if certain containerized processes did not exit nicely, they could continue to run – incurring unneeded utilization and cost. Now, you can specify the Docker init parameter in the Amazon ECS task definition. This ensures the init process is the parent for all processes inside a container, and can terminate processes that have finished execution, but are still running.</p> 
<p>For more information on using devices and init flags, see the Amazon ECS <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#container_definition_security">documentation</a>.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 2, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) now allows applications running in containers to directly access metadata about their environment.<br /> </p> 
<p>Previously, if an application running in a container managed by Amazon ECS required access to information about its environment, you needed to manually call this metadata using the Docker or Amazon ECS introspection API, and inject it into the container.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now, applications running in containers managed by Amazon ECS can directly query environmental metadata such as the Docker container and Docker image name and id, the container’s networking configuration and port mapping, as well as the ECS Task’s and Container Instance Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This makes applications running on Amazon ECS environment-aware, and enables them to self-register in Service Discovery and Configuration Management solutions. &nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 2, 2017</span> </p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis/">Amazon ElastiCache for Redis</a> is now a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/">HIPAA Eligible Service</a> and included to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-compliance/">AWS Business Associate Addendum</a> (BAA). This announcement means you can use ElastiCache for Redis to store, process, and access protected health information (PHI) and power secure healthcare applications. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/what-is-redis/">Redis</a>, an open source, in-memory data store, is a popular choice among developers to power low latency, high throughput internet scale applications. ElastiCache for Redis is a Redis-compatible, fully-managed, in-memory data store and cache in the cloud that delivers sub-millisecond response times with millions of requests per second. Now you can use the speed, simplicity, security, and scalability of ElastiCache for Redis for use cases such as database and application caching, session management, queues, chat/messaging, streaming analytics, and geospatial analytics to build secure, fast, and scalable healthcare apps.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>HIPAA Eligible ElastiCache for Redis is available for all current-generation instance node types and requires <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/SelectEngine.RedisVersions.html#SelectEngine.RedisVersions.RedisVersions.3-2-6" target="_blank">Redis engine version 3.2.6</a>. You must ensure that nodes are configured to encrypt the data <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/in-transit-encryption.html#in-transit-encryption-enable" target="_blank">in transit</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/at-rest-encryption.html#at-rest-encryption-enable" target="_blank">at rest</a>, and to authenticate Redis commands before the engine executes them. See&nbsp;<a href="https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_HIPAA_Compliance_Whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank">Architecting for HIPAA Security and Compliance on Amazon Web Services</a> for information about how to configure Amazon HIPAA Eligible Services to store, process, and transmit PHI.</p> 
<p>ElastiCache for Redis uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="_blank">Advanced Encryption Standard</a> (AES)-512 symmetric keys to encrypt data on disk. The Redis backups stored in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> are encrypted with Server Side Encryption (SSE) using AES-256 symmetric keys. ElastiCache for Redis uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" target="_blank">Transport Layer Security</a> (TLS) to encrypt data in transit. It uses the Redis AUTH token that you provide at the time of Redis cluster creation to authenticate the Redis commands coming from clients. This AUTH token is encrypted using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/">AWS Key Management Service</a>.</p> 
<p>There is no additional charge for HIPAA eligible ElastiCache for Redis. To get started, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/elasticache-compliance-hipaa.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/analytics/">Amazon Kinesis Analytics</a> allows you to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/app-anomaly-detection.html" target="_blank">detect anomalies on streaming data in real time</a>. Today, we launched two new features that provide explanations of the anomalies, making it easy for you to perform root cause analysis. You can learn which fields in your data lead to high anomaly scores and identify trends associated with the anomaly.</p> 
<p>Kinesis Analytics uses <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/analytics/whitepaper-real-time-anomaly-detection/">Random Cut Forest algorithm</a> to analyze one or more numeric fields and generate scores to identify anomalies in data streams. When records in your data stream have a large number of fields, it can be difficult to manually determine which fields lead to high anomaly scores, especially when the data is large, moves fast, and changes frequently. Kinesis Analytics now provides real-time explanations of the anomaly scores using attribution and directionality. Attribution explains the contribution of input fields to the overall score, and directionality provides information about the trends such as dips and spikes in each field. For more information and sample code, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/sqlref/sqlrf-random-cut-forest-with-explanation.html" target="_blank">Random Cut Forest with Explanations</a> in the Amazon Kinesis Analytics SQL Reference.</p> 
<p>Kinesis Analytics is the easiest way to process streaming data in real time with SQL without having to learn new programming languages or processing frameworks. Kinesis Analytics enables you to query streaming data or build entire streaming applications using SQL, so that you can gain actionable insights and respond to your business and customer needs promptly. Kinesis Analytics is available in the US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and EU (Ireland) regions.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 2, 2017</span> </p> 
<p> You can now choose from two types of API endpoints when creating REST APIs and custom domains with Amazon API Gateway. A regional API endpoint is a new type of endpoint that is accessed from the same AWS region in which your REST API is deployed. This helps you reduce request latency when API requests originate from the same region as your REST API. Additionally, you can now choose to associate your own Amazon CloudFront distribution with the regional API endpoint. The second type of API endpoint is the edge-optimized API. Edge-optimized APIs are endpoints that are accessed through a CloudFront distribution that is created and managed by API Gateway. Previously, edge-optimized APIs were the default option for creating APIs with API Gateway.</p> 
<p> To get started, create a new REST API using the Amazon API Gateway console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs and APIs. You can also migrate existing REST APIs and custom domains to a regional API endpoint. Visit our <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/create-regional-api.html">documentation</a> to learn more about this feature.</p>

<p>Apache MXNet version 0.12 is now available with two new important features—support for NVIDIA Volta GPUs, and support for Sparse Tensors.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Support for NVIDIA Volta GPU Architecture</b></p> 
<p>The MXNet v0.12 release adds support for NVIDIA Volta V100 GPUs, enabling customers to train convolutional neural networks up to 3.5 times faster than on the Pascal GPUs. The Volta GPU architecture introduces Tensor Cores, which allow mixed-precision training. With mixed precision of Tensor Cores, users can achieve optimal training performance without sacrificing accuracy by using FP16 for most of the layers of a network, and higher precision data types only when necessary. You can take advantage of Volta Tensor Cores to enable FP16 training in MXNet by passing a simple command.</p> 
<p>Recently we announced a new set of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/ai/announcing-new-aws-deep-learning-ami-for-amazon-ec2-p3-instances/#more-2093" target="_blank">AWS Deep Learning AMIs</a>, which come pre-installed with various deep learning frameworks including MXNet v0.12, optimized for the NVIDIA Volta V100 GPUs in the Amazon EC2 P3 instance family.

<p><b>Sparse Tensor Support<br /> <br /> </b>MXNet v0.12 adds support for sparse tensors to efficiently store and compute tensors allowing developers to perform sparse matrix operations in a storage and compute-efficient manner and train deep learning models faster. This release supports two major sparse data formats–Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) and Row Sparse (RSP). The CSR format is optimized to represent matrices with large number of columns where each row has only a few non-zero elements. The RSP format is optimized to represent matrices with huge number of rows where most of the row slices are completely zeros. This release enables sparse support on CPU for most commonly used operators such as matrix dot product and element-wise operators. Sparse support for more operators will be added in future releases.</p>

<b id="AWS_Direct_Connect_Enables_Global_Access"> <a name="AWS_Direct_Connect_Enables_Global_Access"> AWS Direct Connect Enables Global Access</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Nov 1, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>AWS Direct Connect provides private, high bandwidth connectivity between customer networks and AWS Cloud. The traffic sent over AWS Direct Connect connection stays within the AWS private network instead of traversing the public internet.<br /> </p> 
<p>Today, we are pleased to announce multiple new features for AWS Direct Connect. &nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Global Access for Virtual Private Cloud</b>:&nbsp;To enable global access to customers’ Amazon VPCs, AWS Direct Connect is announcing Direct Connect Gateway, a new feature to allow customers using any AWS Direct Connect Location to use their Direct Connect connections to access any Virtual Private Cloud deployed in any AWS Regions (except AWS China Region). In addition, each Direct Connect Gateway will enable association with one or more Amazon VPCs. Using Direct Connect Gateway, you do not need to have connections in multiple AWS Regions to access your Amazon VPCs in those AWS Regions, and use one (or more) private virtual interface to communicate with multiple Amazon VPCs across any AWS Regions (except AWS China Region).</p> 
<p><b>Global Access for AWS Public Services</b>:&nbsp;To provide global access to Amazon’s publicly routable services, AWS Direct Connect is expanding public inter-region access service at global scale. AWS Direct Connect customers in any AWS Direct Connect location can create public virtual interface to receive Amazon’s global IP routes, and access Amazon’s publicly routable services in any AWS Regions (except AWS China Region). With Global Public Access, you can now access all of Amazon’s public services using newly created AWS Direct Connect public virtual interfaces amplifying the value of your AWS Direct Connect connection.</p> 
<p><b>New Data Transfer Out pricing structure</b>:&nbsp;Effective immediately, customers will be able to determine the Data Transfer Out pricing based on the location of the workload (AWS Region) and the location of the Direct Connect location. With updated data transfer out pricing structure, you can select any AWS Direct Connect location out of our constantly growing locations across the world that best meets your needs.&nbsp;Please visit <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/pricing/">AWS Direct Connect Pricing</a>.</p> 
<p>All new features are generally available in all public AWS Regions (Except AWS China Region), including AWS GovCloud (US). To learn more about these new features, read the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/getting_started.html" target="_blank">AWS Direct Connect Getting Started Guide</a>.</p>

<p>Following the recent announcement of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1777/" target="_blank">updates to the PostgreSQL database</a>, we have updated&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/">Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL</a>&nbsp;to support PostgreSQL minor versions 9.6.5, 9.5.9, 9.4.14, and 9.3.19. This release fixes three PostgreSQL security vulnerabilities and contains other bug fixes and improvements.</p> 
<p>With this update, we have also <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_PostgreSQL.html#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.version965" target="_blank">added support</a> for the ‘pgrouting’ extension to provide geospatial routing functionality in version 9.6.5; the ‘postgresql-hll’ extension to provide a new data type –HyperLogLog data structure – in version 9.6.5; and ‘decoder_raw’ module, an output plugin for logical replication which generates raw queries based on the logical changes in versions 9.6.5.</p> 
<p>You can create a new Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL database instance with just a few clicks in the&nbsp;<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home" target="_blank">AWS Management Console</a>, or upgrade an existing instance using point-and-click upgrades. An upgrade operation involves a short period of unavailability for your database instance. Learn more about upgrading your database instances from the&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Upgrading.html#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.PostgreSQL">Amazon RDS User Guide</a>.</p>
