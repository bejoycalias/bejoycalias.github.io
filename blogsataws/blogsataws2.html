<p>We launched some important new EC2 instance types and features at <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a>. I’ve already told you about the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/m5-the-next-generation-of-general-purpose-ec2-instances/">M5</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-b-instances-fast-dense-storage-for-big-data-applications/">H1</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-t2-unlimited-going-beyond-the-burst-with-high-performance/">T2 Unlimited</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-bare-metal-instances-with-direct-access-to-hardware/">Bare Metal</a> instances, and about <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">Spot</a> features such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ec2-update-streamlined-access-to-spot-capacity-smooth-price-changes-instance-hibernation/">Hibernation</a> and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ec2-update-streamlined-access-to-spot-capacity-smooth-price-changes-instance-hibernation/">New Pricing Model</a>. Randall told you about the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/keeping-time-with-amazon-time-sync-service/">Amazon Time Sync Service</a>. Today I would like to tell you about two of the features that we launched: Spread placement groups and Launch Templates. Both features are available in the EC2 Console and from the EC2 APIs, and can be used in all of the AWS Regions in the “aws” partition:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ec2_menu_1.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Launch Templates</strong></span><br /> You can use launch templates to store the instance, network, security, storage, and advanced parameters that you use to launch EC2 instances, and can also include any desired tags. Each template can include any desired subset of the full collection of parameters. You can, for example, define common configuration parameters such as tags or network configurations in a template, and allow the other parameters to be specified as part of the actual launch.</p> 
<p>Templates give you the power to set up a consistent launch environment that spans instances launched in On-Demand and Spot form, as well as through EC2 Auto Scaling and as part of a Spot Fleet. You can use them to implement organization-wide standards and to enforce best practices, and you can give your IAM users the ability to launch instances via templates while withholding the ability to do so via the underlying APIs.</p> 
<p>Templates are versioned and you can use any desired version when you launch an instance. You can create templates from scratch, base them on the previous version, or copy the parameters from a running instance.</p> 
<p>Here’s how you create a launch template in the Console:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/lt_prod_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Here’s how to include network interfaces, storage volumes, tags, and security groups:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/lt_net_more_1.png" /></p> 
<p>And here’s how to specify advanced and specialized parameters:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/lt_advanced_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You don’t have to specify values for all of these parameters in your templates; enter the values that are common to multiple instances or launches and specify the rest at launch time.</p> 
<p>When you click Create launch template, the template is created and can be used to launch On-Demand instances, create Auto Scaling Groups, and create Spot Fleets:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/lt_greenery_2.png" /></p> 
<p>The <strong>Launch Instance</strong> button now gives you the option to launch from a template:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/con_li_lt_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Simply choose the template and the version, and finalize all of the launch parameters:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/lt_launch_picky_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You can also manage your templates and template versions from the Console:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/lt_action_1.png" /></p> 
<p>To learn more about this feature, read <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html">Launching an Instance from a Launch Template</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Spread Placement Groups</strong></span><br /> Spread placement groups indicate that you do not want the instances in the group to share the same underlying hardware. Applications that rely on a small number of critical instances can launch them in a spread placement group to reduce the odds that one hardware failure will impact more than one instance. Here are a couple of things to keep in mind when you use spread placement groups:</p> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em"><strong>Availability Zones</strong> – A single spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones. You can have a maximum of seven running instances per Availability Zone per group.</li> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em"><strong>Unique Hardware</strong> – Launch requests can fail if there is insufficient unique hardware available. The situation changes over time as overall usage changes and as we add additional hardware; you can retry failed requests at a later time.</li> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em"><strong>Instance Types</strong> – You can launch a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html#placement-groups-spread">wide variety</a> of M4, M5, C3, R3, R4, X1, X1e, D2, H1, I2, I3, HS1, F1, G2, G3, P2, and P3 instances types in spread placement groups.</li> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em"><strong>Reserved Instances</strong> – Instances launched into a spread placement group can make use of reserved capacity. However, you cannot currently reserve capacity for a placement group and could receive an ICE (Insufficient Capacity Error) even if you have some RI’s available.</li> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em"><strong>Applicability</strong> – You cannot use spread placement groups in conjunction with Dedicated Instances or Dedicated Hosts.</li> 
<p>You can create and use spread placement groups from the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/powershell/" title="">AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell</a>, and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/" title="">AWS SDKs</a>. The console has a new feature that will help you to learn how to use the command line:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ec2_pg_create_2.png" /></p> 
<p>You can specify an existing placement group or create a new one when you launch an EC2 instance:</p>

<p>I’ve been talking about scalability for servers and other cloud resources for a very long time! <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/sometimes_you_n/">Back in 2006</a>, I wrote “This is the new world of scalable, on-demand web services. Pay for what you need and use, and not a byte more.” Shortly after we launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" title="">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</a>, we made it easy for you to do this with the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-load-balancing-automatic-scaling-and-cloud-monitoring-services/">simultaneous launch</a> of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing" title="">Elastic Load Balancing</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling">EC2 Auto Scaling</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" title="">Amazon CloudWatch</a>. Since then we have added Auto Scaling to other AWS services including <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/automatic-scaling-with-amazon-ecs/">ECS</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-auto-scaling-for-ec2-spot-fleets/">Spot Fleets</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-auto-scaling-for-amazon-dynamodb/">DynamoDB</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/amazon-aurora-now-supports-auto-scaling-for-aurora-replicas/">Aurora</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-appstream-2-0-features-fleet-auto-scaling-image-builder-saml-metrics-and-fleet-management/">AppStream 2.0</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-auto-scaling-for-emr-clusters/">EMR</a>. We have also added features such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-target-tracking-policies-for-ec2-auto-scaling/">target tracking</a> to make it easier for you to scale based on the metric that is most appropriate for your application.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Introducing AWS Auto Scaling</strong></span><br /> Today we are making it easier for you to use the Auto Scaling features of multiple AWS services from a single user interface with the introduction of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling" title="">AWS Auto Scaling</a>. This new service unifies and builds on our existing, service-specific, scaling features. It operates on any desired EC2 Auto Scaling groups, EC2 Spot Fleets, ECS tasks, DynamoDB tables, DynamoDB Global Secondary Indexes, and Aurora Replicas that are part of your application, as described by an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" title="">AWS CloudFormation</a> stack or in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/" title="">AWS Elastic Beanstalk</a> (we’re also exploring some other ways to flag a set of resources as an application for use with <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span>).</p> 
<p>You no longer need to set up alarms and scaling actions for each resource and each service. Instead, you simply point <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span> at your application and select the services and resources of interest. Then you select the desired scaling option for each one, and <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span> will do the rest, helping you to discover the scalable resources and then creating a scaling plan that addresses the resources of interest.</p> 
<p>If you have tried to use any of our Auto Scaling options in the past, you undoubtedly understand the trade-offs involved in choosing scaling thresholds. <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span> gives you a variety of scaling options: You can optimize for availability, keeping plenty of resources in reserve in order to meet sudden spikes in demand. You can optimize for costs, running close to the line and accepting the possibility that you will tax your resources if that spike arrives. Alternatively, you can aim for the middle, with a generous but not excessive level of spare capacity. In addition to optimizing for availability, cost, or a blend of both, you can also set a custom scaling threshold. In each case, <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span> will create scaling policies on your behalf, including appropriate upper and lower bounds for each resource.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS Auto Scaling in Action</strong></span><br /> I will use <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span> on a simple CloudFormation stack consisting of an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances and a pair of DynamoDB tables. I start by removing the existing Scaling Policies from my Auto Scaling group:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_delete_old_ec2_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I open up the new <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/awsautoscaling/home">Auto Scaling Console</a> and selecting the stack:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_cons_main_2.png" /></p> 
<p>Behind the scenes, Elastic Beanstalk applications are always launched via a CloudFormation stack. In the screen shot above, <strong>awseb-e-sdwttqizbp-stack</strong> is an Elastic Beanstalk application that I launched.</p> 
<p>I can click on any stack to learn more about it before proceeding:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_cons_my_stack_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I select the desired stack and click on <strong>Next</strong> to proceed. Then I enter a name for my scaling plan and choose the resources that I’d like it to include:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_setup_scaling_2.png" /></p> 
<p>I choose the scaling strategy for each type of resource:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_setup_scaling_ec2_as_1.png" /></p> 
<p>After I have selected the desired strategies, I click <strong>Next</strong> to proceed. Then I review the proposed scaling plan, and click <strong>Create scaling plan</strong> to move ahead:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_make_my_plan_2.png" /></p> 
<p>The scaling plan is created and in effect within a few minutes:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_a_man_a_plan_panama_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I can click on the plan to learn more:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_the_plan_details_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I can also inspect each scaling policy:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_policy_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I tested my new policy by applying a load to the initial EC2 instance, and watched the scale out activity take place:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_ec2_scale_up_happening_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I also took a look at the CloudWatch metrics for the EC2 Auto Scaling group:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_asg_metrics_1.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> We are launching <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span> today in the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span>, <span title="">US East (Ohio)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span>, and <span title="">Asia Pacific (Singapore)</span> Regions today, with more to follow. There’s no charge for <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span>; you pay only for the CloudWatch Alarms that it creates and any AWS resources that you consume.</p> 
<p>As is often the case with our new services, this is just the first step on what we hope to be a long and interesting journey! We have a long roadmap, and we’ll be adding new features and options throughout 2018 in response to your feedback.</p>

<p>We expand AWS by picking a geographic area (which we call a Region) and then building multiple, isolated Availability Zones in that area. Each Availability Zone (AZ) has multiple Internet connections and power connections to multiple grids.</p> 
<p>Today I am happy to announce that we are opening our 50<sup>th</sup> AWS Availability Zone, with the addition of a third AZ to the <span title="">EU (London)</span> Region. This will give you additional flexibility to architect highly scalable, fault-tolerant applications that run across multiple AZs in the UK.</p> 
<p>Since launching the <span title="">EU (London)</span> Region, we have seen an ever-growing set of customers, particularly in the public sector and in regulated industries, use AWS for new and innovative applications. Here are a couple of examples, courtesy of my AWS colleagues in the UK:</p> 
<p><strong>Enterprise</strong> – Some of the UK’s most respected enterprises are using AWS to transform their businesses, including <a href="http://www.bbc.com/">BBC</a>, <a href="http://home.bt.com/">BT</a>, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en.html">Deloitte</a>, and <a href="https://www.travisperkins.co.uk/">Travis Perkins</a>. Travis Perkins is one of the largest suppliers of building materials in the UK and is implementing the biggest systems and business change in its history, including an all-in migration of its data centers to AWS.</p> 
<p><strong>Startups</strong> – Cross-border payments company <a href="https://www.currencycloud.com/en-us/">Currencycloud</a> has migrated its entire payments production, and demo platform to AWS resulting in a 30% saving on their infrastructure costs. <a href="https://www.clearscore.com/">Clearscore</a>, with plans to disrupting the credit score industry, has also chosen to host their entire platform on AWS. <a href="https://www.underwriteme.co.uk/">UnderwriteMe</a> is using the EU (London) Region to offer an underwriting platform to their customers as a managed service.</p> 
<p><strong>Public Sector</strong> -The <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/">Met Office</a> chose AWS to support the <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/mobile-digital-services/weather-app">Met Office Weather App</a>, available for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1068146838?pt=294279&amp;ct=Desktop%20Apps%20page&amp;mt=8">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.gov.metoffice.weather.android&amp;referrer=utm_source%3DMet%2520Office%2520Desktop%2520site%2520apps%2520page">Android</a> phones. Since the Met Office Weather App went live in January 2016, it has attracted more than 4.5 million downloads. Using AWS, the Met Office has been able to increase agility, speed, and scalability while reducing costs. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency">Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency</a> (DVLA) is using the <span title="">EU (London)</span> Region for services such as the Strategic Card Payments platform, which helps the agency achieve PCI DSS compliance.</p> 
<p>The AWS <span title="">EU (London)</span> Region has <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-uk-region-achieves-public-services-network-psn-assurance/">achieved Public Services Network (PSN) assurance</a>, which provides UK Public Sector customers with an assured infrastructure on which to build UK Public Sector services. In conjunction with AWS’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/01/standardized-architecture-for-uk-official-in-the-aws-cloud-quick-start-reference-deployment/">Standardized Architecture for UK-OFFICIAL</a>, PSN assurance enables UK Public Sector organizations to move their UK-OFFICIAL classified data to the <span title="">EU (London)</span> Region in a controlled and risk-managed manner.</p> 
<p>For a complete list of AWS Regions and Services, visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">AWS Global Infrastructure</a> page. As always, pricing for services in the Region can be found on the detail pages; visit our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/products/">Cloud Products</a> page to get started.</p>

<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ces_aces_1.png">INRIX</a>. Bryan’s talk provided a glimpse into the future of transportation, centering around four principle attributes, often abbreviated as ACES:</p> 
<p><strong>Autonomous</strong> – Cars and trucks are gaining the ability to scan and to make sense of their environments and to navigate without human input.</p> 
<p><strong>Connected</strong> – Vehicles of all types have the ability to take advantage of bidirectional connections (either full-time or intermittent) to other cars and to cloud-based resources. They can upload road and performance data, communicate with each other to <a href="http://econosystemics.com/?p=730">run in packs</a>, and take advantage of traffic and weather data.</p> 
<p><strong>Electric</strong> – Continued development of battery and motor technology, will make electrics vehicles more convenient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly.</p> 
<p><strong>Shared</strong> – Ride-sharing services will change usage from an ownership model to an as-a-service model (sound familiar?).</p> 
<p>Individually and in combination, these emerging attributes mean that the cars and trucks we will see and use in the decade to come will be markedly different than those of the past.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>On the Road with AWS</strong></span><br /> AWS customers are already using our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot" title="">AWS IoT</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/">edge computing</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/" title="">Amazon Machine Learning</a>, and <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa">Alexa</a> products to bring this future to life – vehicle manufacturers, their tier 1 suppliers, and AutoTech startups all use AWS for their ACES initiatives. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass" title="">AWS Greengrass</a> is playing an important role here, attracting design wins and helping our customers to add processing power and machine learning inferencing at the edge.</p> 
<p>AWS customer <a href="http://www.aptiv.com/">Aptiv</a> (formerly Delphi) talked about their Automated Mobility on Demand (AMoD) smart vehicle architecture in a <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a> session. Aptiv’s AMoD platform will use Greengrass and microservices to drive the onboard user experience, along with edge processing, monitoring, and control. Here’s an overview:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ces_aptiv_amod_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Another customer, <a href="https://www.denso.com/global/en/">Denso</a> of Japan (one of the world’s largest suppliers of auto components and software) is using Greengrass and AWS IoT to support their vision of <a href="https://www.denso.com/global/en/innovation/technology/maas/">Mobility as a Service</a> (MaaS). Here’s a <a href="https://youtu.be/cu9glnsxgYM?t=35m27s">video</a>:</p> 
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cu9glnsxgYM?t=35m27s"><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ces_ri_denso_1.png" /></a></p> 
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">AWS at CES</span></strong><br /> The AWS team will be out in force at CES in Las Vegas and would love to talk to you. They’ll be running demos that show how AWS can help to bring innovation and personalization to connected and autonomous vehicles.</p> 
<p><strong>Personalized In-Vehicle Experience</strong> – This demo shows how AWS AI and Machine Learning can be used to create a highly personalized and branded in-vehicle experience. It makes use of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lex" title="">Amazon Lex</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/polly" title="">Polly</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/" title="">Amazon Rekognition</a>, but the design is flexible and can be used with other services as well. The demo encompasses driver registration, login and startup (including facial recognition), voice assistance for contextual guidance, personalized e-commerce, and vehicle control. Here’s the architecture for the voice assistance:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ces_demo1_1.png" /></p> 
<p><strong>Connected Vehicle Solution</strong> – This demo shows how a connected vehicle can combine local and cloud intelligence, using edge computing and machine learning at the edge. It handles intermittent connections and uses <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/deeplens/" title="">AWS DeepLens</a> to train a model that responds to distracted drivers. Here’s the overall architecture, as described in our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/iot/connected-vehicle-solution/">Connected Vehicle Solution</a>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ces_demo2_1.png" /></p> 
<p><strong>Digital Content Delivery </strong>– This demo will show how a customer uses a web-based 3D configurator to build and personalize their vehicle. It will also show high resolution (4K) 3D image and an optional immersive AR/VR experience, both designed for use within a dealership.</p> 
<p><strong>Autonomous Driving</strong> – This demo will showcase the AWS services that can be used to build autonomous vehicles. There’s a 1/16th scale model vehicle powered and driven by Greengrass and an overview of a new AWS Autonomous Toolkit. As part of the demo, attendees drive the car, training a model via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/" title="">Amazon SageMaker</a> for subsequent on-board inferencing, powered by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/ml/">Greengrass ML Inferencing</a>.</p> 
<p>To speak to one of my colleagues or to set up a time to see the demos, check out the <a href="http://go.amazonsellerservices.com/ces18/aws">Visit AWS at CES 2018</a> page.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Some Resources</strong></span><br /> If you are interested in this topic and want to learn more, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/automotive/">AWS for Automotive</a> page is a great starting point, with discussions on connected vehicles &amp; mobility, autonomous vehicle development, and digital customer engagement.</p> 
<p>When you are ready to start building a connected vehicle, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/iot/connected-vehicle-solution/">AWS Connected Vehicle Solution</a> contains a reference architecture that combines local computing, sophisticated event rules, and cloud-based data processing and storage.

<p>We recently made some updates to AWS Training and Certification to make it easier for you to build your cloud skills and to learn about many of the new services that we launched at <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Free AWS Digital Training</strong></span><br /> You can now find over 100 new digital training classes at <a href="https://www.aws.training/">aws.training</a>, all with unlimited access at no charge.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</strong></span><br /> Our newest certification exam, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/">AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</a>, lets you validate your overall understanding of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" title="">AWS Cloud</a> with an industry-recognized credential.

<p>I’m getting ready to wrap up my work for the year, cleaning up my inbox and catching up on a few recent AWS launches that happened at and shortly after <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a>.</p> 
<p>Last week we launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/" title="">Amazon Linux 2</a>. This is modern version of Linux, designed to meet the security, stability, and productivity needs of enterprise environments while giving you timely access to new tools and features. It also includes all of the things that made the Amazon Linux AMI popular, including AWS integration, <a href="https://cloud-init.io/">cloud-init</a>, a secure default configuration, regular security updates, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support</a>. From that base, we have added many new features including:</p> 
<p><strong>Long-Term Support</strong> – You can use <span title="">Amazon Linux 2</span> in situations where you want to stick with a single major version of Linux for an extended period of time, perhaps to avoid re-qualifying your applications too frequently. This build (2017.12) is a candidate for LTS status; the final determination will be made based on feedback in the <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=228">Amazon Linux Discussion Forum</a>. Long-term support for the Amazon Linux 2 LTS build will include security updates, bug fixes, user-space Application Binary Interface (ABI), and user-space Application Programming Interface (API) compatibility for 5 years.</p> 
<p><strong>Extras Library</strong> – You can now get fast access to fresh, new functionality while keeping your base OS image stable and lightweight. The Amazon Linux Extras Library eliminates the age-old tradeoff between OS stability and access to fresh software. It contains open source databases, languages, and more, each packaged together with any needed dependencies.</p> 
<p><strong>Tuned Kernel</strong> – You have access to the latest 4.9 LTS kernel, with support for the latest EC2 features and tuned to run efficiently in AWS and other virtualized environments.</p> 
<p><strong>Systemd</strong> – <span title="">Amazon Linux 2</span> includes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd">systemd</a> init system, designed to provide better boot performance and increased control over individual services and groups of interdependent services. For example, you can indicate that Service B must be started only after Service A is fully started, or that Service C should start on a change in network connection status.</p> 
<p><strong>Wide Availabilty</strong> – <span title="">Amazon Linux 2</span> is available in all AWS Regions in AMI and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/amazonlinux/">Docker image</a> form. <a href="https://cdn.amazonlinux.com/os-images/2017.12.0.20171212.2/">Virtual machine images</a> for Hyper-V, KVM, VirtualBox, and VMware are also available. You can build and test your applications on your laptop or in your own data center and then deploy them to AWS.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Launching an Instance</strong></span><br /> You can launch an instance in all of the usual ways – <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/powershell/" title="">AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell</a>, <code><a title="undefined" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html" target="null">RunInstances</a></code>, and via a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" title="">AWS CloudFormation</a> template. I’ll use the Console:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/al2_console_launch_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I’m interested in the Extras Library; here’s how I see which topics (lists of packages) are available:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/al2_see_extras_2.png" /></p> 
<p>As you can see, the library includes languages, editors, and web tools that receive frequent updates. Each topic contains all of dependencies that are needed to install the package on <span title="">Amazon Linux 2</span>. For example, the <strong>Rust</strong> topic includes the <a href="http://alexcrichton.com/cmake-rs/cmake/index.html">cmake</a> build system for Rust, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo">cargo</a> for Rust package maintenance, and the LLVM-based compiler toolchain for Rust.</p> 
<p>Here’s how I install a topic (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/news/NEWS.25.3">Emacs 25.3</a>):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/al2_install_extras_emacs_1.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>SNS Updates</strong></span><br /> Many AWS customers use the Amazon Linux AMIs as a starting point for their own AMIs. If you do this and would like to kick off your build process whenever a new AMI is released, you can <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/amazon-linux-ami-basics.html#linux-ami-notifications">subscribe to an SNS topic</a>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/al2_sub_sns_topic_2.png" /></p> 
<p>You can be notified by email, invoke a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> function, and so forth.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/" title="">Amazon Linux 2</a> is available now and you can start using it in the cloud and on-premises today! To learn more, read the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/release-notes/">Amazon Linux 2 LTS Candidate (2017.12) Release Notes</a>.</p>

<p>There are also four edge locations for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/" title="">Amazon Route 53</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" title="">Amazon CloudFront</a>: three in Paris and one in Marseille, all with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/waf" title="">AWS WAF</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/shield/" title="">AWS Shield</a>. Check out the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">AWS Global Infrastructure</a> page to learn more about current and future AWS Regions.</p> 
<p>The Paris Region will benefit from three AWS Direct Connect locations. Telehouse Voltaire is available today. AWS Direct Connect will also become available at Equinix Paris in early 2018, followed by Interxion Paris.</p> 
<p>All AWS infrastructure regions around the world are designed, built, and regularly audited to meet the most rigorous compliance standards and to provide high levels of security for all AWS customers. These include ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, SOC 1 (Formerly SAS 70), SOC 2 and SOC 3 Security &amp; Availability, PCI DSS Level 1, and many more. This means customers benefit from all the best practices of AWS policies, architecture, and operational processes built to satisfy the needs of even the most security sensitive customers.</p> 
<p>AWS is certified under the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">EU-US Privacy Shield</a>, and the AWS Data Processing Addendum (DPA) is GDPR-ready and available now to all AWS customers to help them prepare for May 25, 2018 when the GDPR becomes enforceable. The current AWS DPA, as well as the AWS GDPR DPA, allows customers to transfer personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in compliance with European Union (EU) data protection laws. AWS also adheres to the <a href="https://cispe.cloud/">Cloud Infrastructure Service Providers in Europe</a> (CISPE) <a href="https://cispe.cloud/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>. The CISPE Code of Conduct helps customers ensure that AWS is using appropriate data protection standards to protect their data, consistent with the GDPR. In addition, AWS offers a wide range of services and features to help customers meet the requirements of the GDPR, including services for access controls, monitoring, logging, and encryption.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>From Our Customers</strong></span><br /> Many AWS customers are preparing to use this new Region. Here’s a small sample:</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.societegenerale.com/en/home">Societe Generale</a>, one of the largest banks in France and the world, has accelerated their digital transformation while working with AWS. They developed SG Research, an application that makes reports from Societe Generale’s analysts available to corporate customers in order to improve the decision-making process for investments. The new AWS Region will reduce latency between applications running in the cloud and in their French data centers.</p> 
<p><a href="http://www.sncf.com/">SNCF</a> is the national railway company of France. Their mobile app, powered by AWS, delivers real-time traffic information to 14 million riders. Extreme weather, traffic events, holidays, and engineering works can cause usage to peak at hundreds of thousands of users per second. They are planning to use machine learning and big data to add predictive features to the app.</p> 
<p><a href="http://www.radiofrance.fr/">Radio France</a>, the French public radio broadcaster, offers seven national networks, and uses AWS to accelerate its innovation and stay competitive.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.restosducoeur.org/">Les Restos du Coeur</a>, a French charity that provides assistance to the needy, delivering food packages and participating in their social and economic integration back into French society. Les Restos du Coeur is using AWS for its CRM system to track the assistance given to each of their beneficiaries and the impact this is having on their lives.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.alloresto.fr/">AlloResto</a> by JustEat (a leader in the <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20150717-future-food-tech-french-american-startups-wine-soylent-supercook-ruche">French FoodTech</a> industry), is using AWS to to scale during traffic peaks and to accelerate their innovation process.</p>

<p>In the past I’ve talked about several agents, deaemons, and scripts that you could use to collect system metrics and log files for your Windows and Linux instances and on-premise services and publish them to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" title="">Amazon CloudWatch</a>. The data collected by this somewhat disparate collection of tools gave you visibility into the status and behavior of your compute resources, along with the power to take action when a value goes out of range and indicates a potential issue. You can graph any desired metrics on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudwatch-dashboards-create-use-customized-metrics-views/">CloudWatch Dashboards</a>, initiate actions via <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html">CloudWatch Alarms</a>, and search <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/improvements-to-cloudwatch-logs-dashboards/">CloudWatch Logs</a> to find error messages, while taking advantage of our support for custom <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-high-resolution-custom-metrics-and-alarms-for-amazon-cloudwatch/">high-resolution metrics</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Unified Agent</strong></span><br /> Today we are taking a nice step forward and launching a new, unified CloudWatch Agent. It runs in the cloud and on-premises, on Linux and Windows instances and servers, and handles metrics and log files. You can deploy it using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/features/">AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Run Command</a>, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-state.html">SSM State Manager</a>, or from the CLI. Here are some of the most important <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html">features</a>:</p> 
<p><strong>Single Agent</strong> – A single agent now collects both metrics and logs. This simplifies the setup process and reduces complexity.</p> 
<p><strong>Cross-Platform / Cross-Environment</strong> – The new agent runs in the cloud and on-premises, on 64-bit Linux and 64-bit Windows, and includes HTTP proxy server support.</p> 
<p><strong>Configurable</strong> – The new agent captures the most useful system metrics automatically. It can be configured to collect hundreds of others, including fine-grained metrics on sub-resources such as CPU threads, mounted filesystems, and network interfaces.</p> 
<p><strong>CloudWatch-Friendly</strong> – The new agent supports standard 1-minute metrics and the newer 1-second high-resolution metrics. It automatically includes EC2 dimensions such as Instance Id, Image Id, and Auto Scaling Group Name, and also supports the use of custom dimensions. All of the dimensions can be used for custom aggregation across Auto Scaling Groups, applications, and so forth.</p> 
<p><strong>Migration</strong> – You can easily <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/monitoring-cwagent.html">migrate</a> existing AWS SSM and EC2Config configurations for use with the new agent.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Installing the Agent</strong></span><br /> The CloudWatch Agent uses an <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM role</a> when running on an EC2 instance, and an <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html">IAM user</a> when running on an on-premises server. I used the <strong>AmazonSSMFullAccess</strong> and <strong>AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess</strong> policies because I was a bit short on time, but I could have also followed the directions at <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create-iam-roles-for-cloudwatch-agent.html">Create IAM Roles and Users for Use With CloudWatch Agent</a> to create a fine-tuned custom policy. Here’s my role:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_agent_role_2.png" /></p> 
<p>I can easily add it to a running instance (this is a relatively new and very handy EC2 feature):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_attach_role_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The SSM Agent is already running on my instance. If it wasn’t, I would follow the steps in <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html">Installing and Configuring SSM Agent</a> to set it up.</p> 
<p>Next, I install the CloudWatch Agent using the AWS Systems Manager:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_run_install_agent_1.png" /></p> 
<p>This takes just a few seconds. Now I can use a simple wizard to set up the configuration file for the agent:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_wizard_pt1_2.png" /></p> 
<p>The wizard also lets me set up the log files to be monitored:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_wizard_pt2_3.png" /></p> 
<p>The wizard generates a JSON-format config file and stores it on the instance. It also offers me the option to upload the file to my Parameter Store so that I can deploy it to my other instances (I can also do fine-grained customization of the metrics and log collection configuration by editing the file):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_wizard_pt3_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Now I can start the CloudWatch Agent using Run Command, supplying the name of my configuration in the Parameter Store:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_run_start_agent_1.png" /></p> 
<p>This runs in a few seconds and the agent begins to publish metrics right away. As I mentioned earlier, the agent can publish fine-grained metrics on the resources inside of or attached to an instance. For example, here are the metrics for each filesystem:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_metrics_fs_1.png" /></p> 
<p>There’s a separate log stream for each monitored log file on each instance:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_log_streams_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I can view and search it, just like I can do for any other log stream:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_a_log_stream_1.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Now Available</strong></span><br /> The new CloudWatch Agent is available now and you can start using it today in all public AWS Regions, with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/" title="">AWS GovCloud (US)</a> and the Regions in China to follow.</p> 
<p>There’s no charge for the agent; you pay the usual <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/">CloudWatch prices</a> for logs and custom metrics.</p>
