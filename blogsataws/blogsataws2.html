<p>In 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reported that <a href="https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nationalhealthaccountshistorical.html">healthcare spending made up 17.8% of the U.S. GDP</a> – that’s almost $3.2 trillion or $9,990 per person. By 2025, <a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2017/02/16/spending-growth">the CMS estimates this number will increase to nearly 20%</a>. As cloud technology evolves in the healthcare and life science industries, we are seeing how companies of all sizes are using AWS to provide powerful and innovative solutions to customers across the globe. This month we are excited to feature the following startups:</p> 
<li><b>ClearCare </b>– helping home care agencies operate efficiently and grow their business.</li> 
<li><b>DNAnexus </b>– providing a cloud-based global network for sharing and managing genomic data.</li> 
<p><b>ClearCare (San Francisco, CA)<a href="https://www.clearcareonline.com/"><img class=" wp-image-21479 alignright" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/10/30/clearcare-300x128.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="160" /></a></b></p> 
<p><a href="https://www.clearcareonline.com/">ClearCare</a> envisions a future where home care is the only choice for aging in place. Home care agencies play a critical role in the economy and their communities by significantly lowering the overall cost of care, reducing the number of hospital admissions, and bending the cost curve of aging. Patients receiving home care typically have multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations, driving over $190 billion in healthcare spending in the U.S. each year. To offset these costs, health insurance payers are developing in-home care management programs for patients. ClearCare’s goal is to help home care agencies leverage technology to improve costs, outcomes, and quality of life for the aging population. The company’s powerful software platform is specifically designed for use by non-medical, in-home care agencies to manage their businesses.</p> 
<p>Founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/geoffrey-nudd-7501b9/">Geoff Nudd</a> created ClearCare because of his own grandmother’s need for care. Keeping family members and caregivers up to date on a loved one’s well being can be difficult, so Geoff created what is now ClearCare’s <a href="https://www.clearcareonline.com/family-room">Family Room</a>, which enables caregivers and agency staff to check schedules and receive real-time updates about what’s happening in the home. Since then, agencies have provided feedback on others areas of their businesses that could be streamlined. ClearCare has now built over 20 modules to help home care agencies optimize operations with services including a <a href="https://www.clearcareonline.com/smart-telephony">telephony service</a>, <a href="https://www.clearcareonline.com/billing-payroll">billing and payroll</a>, and more. ClearCare now serves over 4,000 home care agencies, representing 500,000 caregivers and 400,000 seniors.</p> 
<p>Using AWS, ClearCare is able to spin up reliable infrastructure for proofs of concept and iterate on those systems to quickly get value to market. The company runs many AWS services including <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/?nc2=h_m1">Amazon Elasticsearch Service</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/?nc2=h_m1">Amazon RDS</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/?nc2=h_m1">Amazon CloudFront</a>. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/emr/?nc2=h_m1">Amazon EMR</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/athena/?nc2=h_m1">Amazon Athena</a> have enabled ClearCare to build a Hadoop-based ETL and data warehousing system that processes terabytes of data each day. By utilizing these managed services, ClearCare has been able to go from concept to customer delivery in less than three months.</p>

<p><b>DNAnexus (Mountain View, CA)<br /> </b></p> 
<p><a href="https://www.dnanexus.com/">DNAnexus</a> is accelerating the application of genomic data in precision medicine by <a href="https://www.dnanexus.com/"><img class=" wp-image-21480 alignright" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/10/30/dnanexus-medium-300x53.png" alt="" width="390" height="69" /></a>providing a cloud-based platform for sharing and managing genomic and biomedical data and analysis tools. The company was founded in 2009 by Stanford graduate student <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asundqui/">Andreas Sundquist</a> and two Stanford professors <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arend-sidow-19b74211/">Arend Sidow</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/serafim-batzoglou-89a148/">Serafim Batzoglou</a>, to address the need for scaling secondary analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data in the cloud. The founders quickly learned that users needed a flexible solution to build complex analysis workflows and tools that enable them to share and manage large volumes of data. DNAnexus is optimized to address the challenges of security, scalability, and collaboration for organizations that are pursuing genomic-based approaches to health, both in clinics and research labs. DNAnexus has a global customer base – spanning North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, South America, and Africa – that runs a million jobs each month and is doubling their storage year-over-year. The company currently stores more than 10 petabytes of biomedical and genomic data. That is equivalent to approximately 100,000 genomes, or in simpler terms, over 50 billion Facebook photos!</p> 
<p>DNAnexus is working with its customers to help expand their translational informatics research, which includes expanding into clinical trial genomic services. This will help companies developing different medicines to better stratify clinical trial populations and develop companion tests that enable the right patient to get the right medicine. In collaboration with <a href="http://www.janssen.com/human-microbiome-institute">Janssen Human Microbiome Institute</a>, DNAnexus is also launching <a href="http://mosaicbiome.com/">Mosaic</a> – a community platform for microbiome research.</p> 
<p>AWS provides DNAnexus and its customers the flexibility to grow and scale research programs. Building the technology infrastructure required to manage these projects in-house is expensive and time-consuming. DNAnexus removes that barrier for labs of any size by using AWS scalable cloud resources. The company deploys its customers’ genomic pipelines on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a>, using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> for high-performance, high-durability storage, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/">Amazon Glacier</a> for low-cost data archiving. DNAnexus is also an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/health/life-sciences-partners/">AWS Life Sciences Competency Partner</a>.</p>

<p>Driven by customer demand and made possible by on-going advances in the state-of-the-art, we’ve come a long way since the original <strong>m1.small</strong> instance that we launched in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon_ec2_beta/">2006</a>, with instances that emphasize compute power, burstable performance, memory size, local storage, and accelerated computing.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>The New P3</strong></span><br /> Today we are making the next generation of GPU-powered EC2 instances available in four AWS regions. Powered by up to eight <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-v100/">NVIDIA Tesla V100</a> GPUs, the P3 instances are designed to handle compute-intensive machine learning, deep learning, computational fluid dynamics, computational finance, seismic analysis, molecular modeling, and genomics workloads.</p> 
<p>P3 instances use customized Intel Xeon E5-2686v4 processors running at up to 2.7 GHz. They are available in three sizes (all VPC-only and EBS-only):</p>

<p>Each of the NVIDIA GPUs is packed with 5,120 CUDA cores and another 640 Tensor cores and can deliver up to 125 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS">TFLOPS</a> of mixed-precision floating point, 15.7 TFLOPS of single-precision floating point, and 7.8 TFLOPS of double-precision floating point. On the two larger sizes, the GPUs are connected together via <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/nvlink.html">NVIDIA NVLink 2.0</a> running at a total data rate of up to 300 GBps. This allows the GPUs to exchange intermediate results and other data at high speed, without having to move it through the CPU or the PCI-Express fabric.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>What’s a Tensor Core?</strong></span><br /> I had not heard the term Tensor core before starting to write this post. According to this <a href="https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/inside-volta/">very helpful post</a> on the NVIDIA Blog, Tensor cores are designed to speed up the training and inference of large, deep neural networks. Each core is able to quickly and efficiently multiply a pair of 4&times;4 half-precision (also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format">FP16</a>) matrices together, add the resulting 4&times;4 matrix to another half or single-precision (FP32) matrix, and store the resulting 4&times;4 matrix in either half or single-precision form. Here’s a diagram from NVIDIA’s blog post:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/nvidia_tensor_core_op_math_2.png" width="800" height="198" /></p> 
<p>This operation is in the innermost loop of the training process for a deep neural network, and is an excellent example of how today’s NVIDIA GPU hardware is purpose-built to address a very specific market need. By the way, the <em>mixed-precision</em> qualifier on the Tensor core performance means that it is flexible enough to work with with a combination of 16-bit and 32-bit floating point values.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Performance in Perspective</strong></span><br /> I always like to put raw performance numbers into a real-world perspective so that they are easier to relate to and (hopefully) more meaningful. This turned out to be surprisingly difficult, given that the eight NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs on a single <strong>p3.16xlarge</strong> can do 125 trillion single-precision floating point multiplications per second.</p> 
<p>Let’s go back to the dawn of the microprocessor era, and consider the Intel 8080A chip that powered the MITS Altair that I bought in the summer of 1977. With a 2 MHz clock, it was able to do about 832 multiplications per second (I used <a href="https://www.pcjs.org/pubs/pc/reference/intel/8087/">this data</a> and corrected it for the faster clock speed). The <strong>p3.16xlarge</strong> is roughly 150 billion times faster. However, just 1.2 billion seconds have gone by since that summer. In other words, I can do 100x more calculations today in one second than my Altair could have done in the last 40 years!</p> 
<p>What about the innovative 8087 math coprocessor that was an optional accessory for the IBM PC that was announced in the summer of 1981? With a 5 MHz clock and purpose-built hardware, it was able to do about 52,632 multiplications per second. 1.14 billion seconds have elapsed since then, <strong>p3.16xlarge</strong> is 2.37 billion times faster, so the poor little PC would be barely halfway through a calculation that would run for 1 second today.</p> 
<p>Ok, how about a Cray-1? First delivered in 1976, this supercomputer was able to perform vector operations at 160 MFLOPS, making the <strong>p3.x16xlarge</strong> 781,000 times faster. It could have iterated on some interesting problem 1500 times over the years since it was introduced.</p> 
<p>Comparisons between the P3 and today’s scale-out supercomputers are harder to make, given that you can think of the P3 as a step-and-repeat component of a supercomputer that you can launch on as as-needed basis.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Run One Today<br /> </strong></span>In order to take full advantage of the NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs and the Tensor cores, you will need to use <a title="undefined" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit/whatsnew" target="null">CUDA 9</a> and <a title="undefined" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn" target="null">cuDNN7</a>. These drivers and libraries have already been added to the newest versions of the Windows AMIs and will be included in an updated Amazon Linux AMI that is scheduled for release on November 7th. New packages are already available in our repos if you want to to install them on your existing Amazon Linux AMI.</p> 
<p>The newest <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/amis/">AWS Deep Learning AMIs</a> come preinstalled with the latest releases of Apache MxNet, Caffe2, and Tensorflow (each with support for the NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs), and will be updated to support P3 instances with other machine learning frameworks such as Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit and PyTorch as soon as these frameworks release support for the NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs. You can also use the NVIDIA Volta Deep Learning AMI for NGC.</p> 
<p>P3 instances are available in the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span>, and <span title="">Asia Pacific (Tokyo)</span> Regions in On-Demand, Spot, Reserved Instance, and Dedicated Host form.</p>

<p>Late last year I told you about our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-aurora-update-postgresql-compatibility/">plans</a> to add PostgreSQL compatibility to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/" title="">Amazon Aurora</a>. We launched the private beta shortly after that announcement, and followed it up earlier this year with an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/sign-up-today-preview-of-amazon-aurora-with-postgresql-compatibility/">open preview</a>. We’ve received lots of great feedback during the beta and the preview and have done our best to make sure that the product meets your needs and exceeds your expectations!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Now Generally Available</strong></span><br /> I am happy to report that Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL Compatibility is now generally available and that you can use it today in four AWS Regions, with more to follow. It is compatible with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/release-9-6-3.html">PostgreSQL 9.6.3</a> and scales automatically to support up to 64 TB of storage, with 6-way replication behind the scenes to improve performance and availability.</p> 
<p>Just like Amazon Aurora with MySQL compatibility, this edition is fully managed and is very easy to set up and to use. On the performance side, you can expect up to 3x the throughput that you’d get if you ran PostgreSQL on your own (you can read <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/p1041-verbitski.pdf">Amazon Aurora: Design Considerations for High Throughput Cloud-Native Relational Databases</a> to learn more about how we did this).</p> 
<p>You can launch a PostgreSQL-compatible Amazon Aurora instance from the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home">RDS Console</a> by selecting Amazon Aurora as the engine and PostgreSQL-compatible as the edition, and clicking on <strong>Next</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_console_launch_page1_3.png" width="688" height="635" /></p> 
<p>Then choose your instance class, single or Multi-AZ deployment (good for dev/test and production, respectively), set the instance name, and the administrator credentials, and click on <strong>Next</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_console_launch_page2_2.png" width="775" height="535" /></p> 
<p>You can choose between six instance classes (2 to 64 vCPUs and 15.25 to 488 GiB of memory):</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_console_instance_types_menu_2.png" width="286" height="162" /></p> 
<p>The <strong>db.r4</strong> instance class is new addition to Aurora and to RDS, and gives you an additional size at the top-end. The <strong>db.r4.16xlarge</strong> will give you additional write performance, and may allow you to use a single Aurora database instead of two or more sharded databases.</p> 
<p>You can also set many advanced options on the next page, starting with network options such as the VPC and public accessibility:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_adv_net_3.png" width="770" height="357" /></p> 
<p>You can set the cluster name and other database options. Encryption is easy to use and enabled by default; you can use the built-in default master key or choose one of your own:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_adv_db_3.png" width="900" height="482" /></p> 
<p>You can also set failover behavior, the retention period for snapshot backups, and choose to enable collection of detailed (OS-level) metrics via Enhanced Monitoring:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_adv_fbr_2.png" width="895" height="593" /></p> 
<p>After you have set it up to your liking, click on <strong>Launch DB Instance</strong> to proceed!</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_takeoff_2.png" width="661" height="600" /></p> 
<p>The new instances (primary and secondary since I specified Multi-AZ) are up and running within minutes:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_running_3.png" /></p> 
<p>Each PostgreSQL-compatible instance publishes 44 metrics to CloudWatch automatically:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_metrics_std_2.png" width="810" height="922" /></p> 
<p>With enhanced monitoring enabled, each instance collects additional per-instance and per-process metrics. It can be enabled when the instance is launched, or afterward, via <strong>Modify Instance</strong>. Here are some of the metrics collected when enhanced monitoring is enabled:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_enh_metrics_2.png" width="810" height="629" /></p> 
<p>Clicking on Manage Graphs lets you choose which metrics are shown:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_pick_em_1.png" width="830" height="715" /></p> 
<p>Per-process metrics are also available:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_procs_1.png" width="810" height="527" /></p> 
<p>You can scale your read capacity by creating up to 15 Aurora replicas:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_create_rr_2.png" width="288" height="527" /></p> 
<p>The cluster provides a single reader endpoint that you can access in order to load-balance requests across the replicas:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_endpoint_2.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Performance Insights</strong></span><br /> As I noted earlier, Performance Insights is turned on automatically. This Amazon Aurora feature is wired directly into the database engine and allows you to look deep inside of each query, seeing the database resources that it uses and how they contribute to the overall response time. Here’s the initial view:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_pi_load_2.png" /></p> 
<p>I can slice the view by SQL query in order to see how many concurrent copies of each query are running:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_pi_load_by_query_2.png" /></p> 
<p>There are more views and options than I can fit in this post; to learn more take a look at <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.html">Using Performance Insights</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Migrating to Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL Compatibility</strong></span><br /> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dms/" title="">AWS Database Migration Service</a> and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dms/#sct" title="">Schema Conversion Tool</a> are ready to help you to move data stored in commercial and open-source databases to Amazon Aurora. The Schema Conversion Tool will perform a quick assessment of your database schemas and your code in order to help you to choose between MySQL and PostgreSQL. Our new, limited-time, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dms/free-dms/">Free DMS</a> program allows you to use DMS and SCT to migrate to Aurora at no cost, with access to several types of DMS Instances for up to 6 months.</p> 
<p>If you are already using PostgreSQL, you will be happy to hear that we support a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_PostgreSQL.html#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.FeatureSupport.Extensions.96x">long list of extensions</a> including <a href="http://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/dblink.html">dblink</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> You can use Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL Compatibility today in the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span>, <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, and <span title="">US East (Ohio)</span> Regions, with others to follow as soon as possible.</p>

<p>You have long had the ability to tag your AWS resources and to see cost breakouts on a per-tag basis. Cost allocation was launched in 2012 (see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-cost-allocation/">AWS Cost Allocation for Customer Bills</a>) and we have steadily added support for additional services, most recently DynamoDB (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/announcing-tagging-for-amazon-dynamodb/">Introducing Cost Allocation Tags for Amazon DynamoDB</a>), Lambda (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/04/aws-lambda-supports-tagging-and-cost-allocations/">AWS Lambda Supports Tagging and Cost Allocations</a>), and EBS (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-cost-allocation-for-ebs-snapshots/">New – Cost Allocation for AWS Snapshots</a>).</p> 
<p>Today, we are launching tag-based cost allocation for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" title="">Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)</a>. You can now assign tags to your queues and use them to manage your costs at any desired level: application, application stage (for a loosely coupled application that communicates via queues), project, department, or developer. After you have tagged your queues, you can use the AWS Tag Editor to search queues that have tags of interest.</p> 
<p>Here’s how I would add three tags (<strong>app</strong>, <strong>stage</strong>, and <strong>department</strong>) to one of my queues:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/sqs_tag_queue_1.png" width="860" height="521" /></p> 
<p>This feature is available now in all AWS Regions and you can start using in today! To learn more about tagging, read <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-queue-tags.html">Tagging Your Amazon SQS Queues</a>. To learn more about cost allocation via tags, read <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html">Using Cost Allocation Tags</a>. To learn more about how to use message queues to build loosely coupled microservices for modern applications, read our blog post (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-loosely-coupled-scalable-c-applications-with-amazon-sqs-and-amazon-sns/">Building Loosely Coupled, Scalable, C# Applications with Amazon SQS and Amazon SNS</a>) and watch the recording of our recent webinar, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UesxWuZMZqI">Decouple and Scale Applications Using Amazon SQS and Amazon SNS</a>.</p> 
<p>If you are coming to <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a>, plan to attend session <a href="https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=17553">ARC 330: How the BBC Built a Massive Media Pipeline Using Microservices</a>. In the talk you will find out how they used SNS and SQS to improve the elasticity and reliability of the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer">BBC iPlayer</a> architecture.</p>

<p>With just 40 days remaining before <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a> begins, my colleagues and I want to share some tips that will help you to make the most of your time in Las Vegas. As always, our focus is on training and education, mixed in with some after-hours fun and recreation for balance.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Locations, Locations, Locations</strong></span><br /> The <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/campus/">re:Invent Campus</a> will span the length of the Las Vegas strip, with events taking place at the MGM Grand, Aria, Mirage, Venetian, Palazzo, the Sands Expo Hall, the Linq Lot, and the Encore. Each venue will host tracks devoted to specific topics:</p> 
<p><a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/campus/"><img style="float: right;margin-left: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/reinvent_2017_strip_map_1.png" /></a><strong>MGM Grand</strong> – Business Apps, Enterprise, Security, Compliance, Identity, Windows.</p> 
<p><strong>Aria</strong> – Analytics &amp; Big Data, Alexa, Container, IoT, AI &amp; Machine Learning, and Serverless.</p> 
<p><strong>Mirage</strong> – Bootcamps, Certifications &amp; Certification Exams.</p> 
<p><strong>Venetian / Palazzo / Sands Expo Hall</strong> – Architecture, AWS Marketplace &amp; Service Catalog, Compute, Content Delivery, Database, DevOps, Mobile, Networking, and Storage.</p> 
<p><strong>Linq Lot</strong> – Alexa Hackathons, Gameday, Jam Sessions, re:Play Party, Speaker Meet &amp; Greets.</p> 
<p><strong>Encore</strong> – <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/info/bookable-meeting-space/">Bookable meeting space</a>.</p> 
<p>If your interests span more than one topic, plan to take advantage of the re:Invent shuttles that will be making the rounds between the venues.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Lots of Content</strong></span><br /> The <a href="https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/search.ww">re:Invent Session Catalog</a> is now live and you should start to choose the sessions of interest to you now.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/search.ww"><img style="float: right;margin-left: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/reinvent_2017_session_catalog_1.png" /></a>With more than 1100 sessions on the agenda, planning is essential! Some of the most popular “deep dive” sessions will be run more than once and others will be streamed to overflow rooms at other venues. We’ve analyzed a lot of data, run some simulations, and are doing our best to provide you with multiple opportunities to build an action-packed schedule.</p> 
<p>We’re just about ready to let you reserve seats for your sessions (follow <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffbarr">me</a> and/or <a href="https://twitter.com/awscloud">@awscloud</a> on Twitter for a heads-up). Based on feedback from earlier years, we have fine-tuned our seat reservation model. This year, 75% of the seats for each session will be reserved and the other 25% are for walk-up attendees. We’ll start to admit walk-in attendees 10 minutes before the start of the session.</p> 
<p>Las Vegas never sleeps and neither should you! This year we have a host of late-night sessions, workshops, chalk talks, and hands-on labs to keep you busy after dark.</p> 
<p>To learn more about our plans for sessions and content, watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIngAvWk0gY">Get Ready for re:Invent 2017 Content Overview</a> video.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Have Fun</strong></span><br /> After you’ve had enough training and learning for the day, plan to attend the <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/pubcrawl/">Pub Crawl</a>, the <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/replay/">re:Play party</a>, the <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/tatonka-challenge/">Tatonka Challenge</a> (two locations this year), our <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/hands-on-lego/">Hands-On LEGO Activities</a>, and the <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/harley-ride">Harley Ride</a>. Stay fit with our <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/run/">4K Run</a>, <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/spinning-challenge/">Spinning Challenge</a>, <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/bootcamp/">Fitness Bootcamps</a>, and <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/broomball/">Broomball</a> (a longstanding Amazon tradition).</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>See You in Vegas</strong></span><br /> As always, I am looking forward to meeting as many AWS users and blog readers as possible. Never hesitate to stop me and to say hello!</p>

<p>Starting today, you can connect to your Amazon Elasticsearch Service domains from within an Amazon VPC without the need for NAT instances or Internet gateways. VPC support for Amazon ES is easy to configure, reliable, and offers an extra layer of security. With VPC support, traffic between other services and Amazon ES stays entirely within the AWS network, isolated from the public Internet. You can manage network access using existing VPC security groups, and you can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for additional protection. VPC support for Amazon ES domains is available at no additional charge.</p> 
<h3>Getting Started</h3> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21238" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/10/16/2017-10-16-10.43.19.gif" alt="" width="1310" height="688" /></p> 
<p>Creating an Amazon Elasticsearch Service domain in your VPC is easy. Follow all the steps you would normally follow to create your cluster and then select “VPC access”.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21241" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/10/16/Screenshot-2017-10-16-15.46.23.png" alt="" width="1280" height="505" /></p> 
<p>That’s it. There are no additional steps. You can now access your domain from within your VPC!</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21244" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/10/16/Screenshot-2017-10-16-18.56.42.png" alt="" width="1822" height="806" /></p> 
<h3>Things To Know</h3> 
<p>To support VPCs, Amazon ES places an endpoint into at least one subnet of your VPC. Amazon ES places an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) into the VPC for each data node in the cluster. Each ENI uses a private IP address from the IPv4 range of your subnet and receives a public DNS hostname. If you enable zone awareness, Amazon ES creates endpoints in two subnets in different availability zones, which provides greater data durability.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21266" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/10/17/2az_arch.png" alt="" width="1158" height="900" /></p> 
<p>You need to set aside three times the number of IP addresses as the number of nodes in your cluster. You can divide that number by two if Zone Awareness is enabled. Ideally, you would create separate subnets just for Amazon ES.</p> 
<p>A few notes:</p> 
<li>Currently, you cannot move existing domains to a VPC or vice-versa. To take advantage of VPC support, you must create a new domain and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-managedomains-snapshots.html">migrate your data</a>.</li> 
<li>Currently, Amazon ES does not support Amazon Kinesis Firehose integration for domains inside a VPC.</li> 
<p>To learn more, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-vpc.html">Amazon ES documentation</a>.</p>

<p>I first told you about <a href="https://amazonlightsail.com" title="">Amazon Lightsail</a> last year in my blog post, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-lightsail-the-power-of-aws-the-simplicity-of-a-vps/">Amazon Lightsail – the Power of AWS, the Simplicity of a VPS</a>. Since last year’s launch, thousands of customers have used Lightsail to get started with AWS, launching Linux-based Virtual Private Servers.</p> 
<p>Today we are adding support for Windows-based Virtual Private Servers. You can launch a VPS that runs Windows Server 2012 R2, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/windows-server">Windows Server 2016</a>, or Windows Server 2016 with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express">SQL Server 2016 Express</a> and be up and running in minutes. You can use your VPS to build, test, and deploy .NET or Windows applications without having to set up or run any infrastructure. Backups, DNS management, and operational metrics are all accessible with a click or two.</p> 
<p>Servers are available in five sizes, with 512 MB to 8 GB of RAM, 1 or 2 vCPUs, and up to 80 GB of SSD storage. Prices (including software licenses) start at $10 per month:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ls_win_plans_1.png" width="814" height="314" /></p> 
<p>You can try out a 512 MB server for one month (up to 750 hours) at no charge.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Launching a Windows VPS</strong></span><br /> To launch a Windows VPS, <a href="https://amazonlightsail.com/">log in to Lightsail</a> , click on <strong>Create instance</strong>, and select the <strong>Microsoft Windows</strong> platform. Then click on <strong>Apps + OS</strong> if you want to run SQL Server 2016 Express, or <strong>OS Only</strong> if Windows is all you need:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ls_pick_os_win_1.png" width="900" height="908" /></p> 
<p>If you want to use a Powershell script to customize your instance after it launches for the first time, click on <strong>Add launch script</strong> and enter the script:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ls_win_powershell_1.png" width="672" height="276" /></p> 
<p>Choose your instance plan, enter a name for your instance(s), and select the quantity to be launched, then click on <strong>Create</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ls_win_ready_create_one_2.png" width="900" height="627" /></p> 
<p>Your instance will be up and running within a minute or so:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ls _win_running_1.png" width="900" height="478" /></p> 
<p>Click on the instance, and then click on <strong>Connect using RDP</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ls_win_connect_1.png" width="900" height="763" /></p> 
<p>This will connect using a built-in, browser-based RDP client (you can also use the IP address and the credentials with another client):</p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS </a>and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/blog/2017/10/microsoft-aws-advance-open-ai-ecosystem-gluon-partnership/">Microsoft</a> announced <a href="http://www.github.com/gluon-api/gluon-api/">Gluon</a>, a new open source deep learning interface which allows developers to more easily and quickly build machine learning models, without compromising performance.</p> 
<p><img class="wp-image-21191 size-medium alignright" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/10/12/photo-1-300x234.jpg" alt="Gluon Logo" width="300" height="234" /></p> 
<p>Gluon provides a clear, concise API for defining machine learning models using a collection of pre-built, optimized neural network components. Developers who are new to machine learning will find this interface more familiar to traditional code, since machine learning models can be defined and manipulated just like any other data structure. More seasoned data scientists and researchers will value the ability to build prototypes quickly and utilize dynamic neural network graphs for entirely new model architectures, all without sacrificing training speed.</p> 
<p>Gluon is available in <a href="https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/gluon/">Apache MXNet</a> today, a forthcoming Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit release, and in more frameworks over time.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Neural Networks vs Developers<br /> </strong></span>Machine learning with neural networks (including ‘deep learning’) has three main components: data for training; a neural network model, and an algorithm which trains the neural network. You can think of the neural network in a similar way to a directed graph; it has a series of inputs (which represent the data), which connect to a series of outputs (the prediction), through a series of connected layers and weights. During training, the algorithm adjusts the weights in the network based on the error in the network output. This is the process by which the network learns; it is a memory and compute intensive process which can take days.</p> 
<p>Deep learning frameworks such as Caffe2, Cognitive Toolkit, TensorFlow, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mxnet/">Apache MXNet</a> are, in part, an answer to the question ‘how can we speed this process up? Just like query optimizers in databases, the more a training engine knows about the network and the algorithm, the more optimizations it can make to the training process (for example, it can infer what needs to be re-computed on the graph based on what else has changed, and skip the unaffected weights to speed things up). These frameworks also provide parallelization to distribute the computation process, and reduce the overall training time.</p> 
<p>However, in order to achieve these optimizations, most frameworks require the developer to do some extra work: specifically, by providing a formal definition of the network graph, up-front, and then ‘freezing’ the graph, and just adjusting the weights.</p> 
<p>The network definition, which can be large and complex with millions of connections, usually has to be constructed by hand. Not only are deep learning networks unwieldy, but they can be difficult to debug and it’s hard to re-use the code between projects.</p> 
<p>The result of this complexity can be difficult for beginners and is a time-consuming task for more experienced researchers. At AWS, we’ve been experimenting with some ideas in MXNet around new, flexible, more approachable ways to define and train neural networks. Microsoft is also a contributor to the open source MXNet project, and were interested in some of these same ideas. Based on this, we got talking, and found we had a similar vision: to use these techniques to reduce the complexity of machine learning, making it accessible to more developers.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Enter Gluon: dynamic graphs, rapid iteration, scalable training<br /> </strong></span>Gluon introduces four key innovations.</p> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>Friendly API:</strong> Gluon networks can be defined using a simple, clear, concise code – this is easier for developers to learn, and much easier to understand than some of the more arcane and formal ways of defining networks and their associated weighted scoring functions.</li> 
<li><strong>Dynamic networks:</strong> the network definition in Gluon is dynamic: it can bend and flex just like any other data structure. This is in contrast to the more common, formal, symbolic definition of a network which the deep learning framework has to effectively carve into stone in order to be able to effectively optimize computation during training. Dynamic networks are easier to manage, and with Gluon, developers can easily ‘hybridize’ between these fast symbolic representations and the more friendly, dynamic ‘imperative’ definitions of the network and algorithms.</li> 
<li><strong>The algorithm can define the network:</strong> the model and the training algorithm are brought much closer together. Instead of separate definitions, the algorithm can adjust the network dynamically during definition and training. Not only does this mean that developers can use standard programming loops, and conditionals to create these networks, but researchers can now define even more sophisticated algorithms and models which were not possible before. They are all easier to create, change, and debug.</li> 
<li><strong>High performance operators for training:</strong> which makes it possible to have a friendly, concise API and dynamic graphs, without sacrificing training speed. This is a huge step forward in machine learning. Some frameworks bring a friendly API or dynamic graphs to deep learning, but these previous methods all incur a cost in terms of training speed. As with other areas of software, abstraction can slow down computation since it needs to be negotiated and interpreted at run time. Gluon can efficiently blend together a concise API with the formal definition under the hood, without the developer having to know about the specific details or to accommodate the compiler optimizations manually.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>The team here at AWS, and our collaborators at Microsoft, couldn’t be more excited to bring these improvements to developers through Gluon. We’re already seeing quite a bit of excitement from developers and researchers alike.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Getting started with Gluon<br /> </strong></span>Gluon is available today in Apache MXNet, with support coming for the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit in a future release. We’re also publishing the front-end interface and the low-level API specifications so it can be included in other frameworks in the fullness of time.</p> 
<p>You can get started with Gluon today. Fire up the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/amis/">AWS Deep Learning AMI</a> with a single click and jump into one of 50 fully worked, notebook examples. If you’re a contributor to a machine learning framework, check out the interface specs on <a href="https://github.com/gluon-api/gluon-api/">GitHub</a>.</p>
