<p>I’m still catching up with the last couple of <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a> launches!</p> 
<p>Today I would like to tell you about inter-region VPC peering. You have been able to create peering connections between Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in the same AWS Region since early 2014 (read <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-vpc-peering-for-the-amazon-virtual-private-cloud/">New VPC Peering for the Amazon Virtual Cloud</a> to learn more). Once established, EC2 instances in the peered VPCs can communicate with each other across the peering connection using their private IP addresses, just as if they were on the same network.</p> 
<p>At <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">re:Invent</a> we extended the peering model so that it works across AWS Regions. Like the existing model, it also works within the same AWS account or across a pair of accounts. All of the use cases that I listed in my earlier post still apply; you can centralize shared resources in an organization-wide VPC and then peer it with multiple, per-department VPCs. You can also share resources between members of a consortium, conglomerate, or joint venture.</p> 
<p>Inter-region VPC peering also allows you to take advantage of the high degree of isolation that exists between AWS Regions while building highly functional applications that span Regions. For example, you can choose geographic locations for your compute and storage resources that will help you to comply with regulatory requirements and other constraints.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Peering Details</strong></span><br /> This feature is currently enabled in the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span>, <span title="">US East (Ohio)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, and <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span> Regions and for IPv4 traffic. You can connect any two VPCs in these Regions, as long as they have distinct, non-overlapping CIDR blocks. This ensures that all of the private IP addresses are unique and allows all of the resources in the pair of VPCs to address each other without the need for any form of network address translation.</p> 
<p>Connections are requested by sending an invitation from one VPC to the other and the invitation must be accepted in order to establish the connection. You can set up a peering connection using the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/vpc/">VPC APIs</a>, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>, or the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/powershell/" title="">AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell</a>.</p> 
<p>Data that passes between VPCs in distinct regions flows across the AWS global network in encrypted form. The data is encrypted in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption">AEAD</a> fashion using a modern algorithm and AWS-supplied keys that are managed and rotated automatically. The same key is used to encrypt traffic for all peering connections; this makes all traffic, regardless of customer, look the same. This anonymity provides additional protection in situations where your inter-VPC traffic is intermittent.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Setting up Inter-Region Peering</strong></span><br /> Here’s how I set up peering between two of my VPCs. I’ll start with a VPC in <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span> and request peering with a VPC in <span title="">US East (Ohio)</span>. I start by noting the ID (<strong>vpc-acd8ccc5</strong>) of the VPC in Ohio:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ivpc_accept_id_2.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I switch to the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span> Region, click on <strong>Create Peering Connection</strong>, and choose to peer with the VPC in Ohio. I enter the Id and click on <strong>Create Peering Connection</strong> to proceed:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ivpc_create_2.png" /></p> 
<p>This creates a peering request:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ivpc_req_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I switch to the other Region and accept the pending request:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ivpc_accept_req_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Now I need to arrange to route IPv4 traffic between the two VPCs by creating route table entries in each one. I can edit the main route table or one associated with a particular VPC subnet. Here’s how I arrange to route traffic from Virginia to Ohio:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ivpc_va_to_ohio_1.png" /></p> 
<p>And here’s how I route it from Ohio to Virginia:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ivpc_ohio_to_va_1.png" /></p> 
<p>To learn more about how to do this, read <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/vpc-peering-routing.html">Updating Your Route Tables for a VPC Peering Connection</a>.</p> 
<p>The private DNS names for EC2 instances (<strong>ip-10-90-211-18.ec2.internal</strong> and the like) will not resolve across a peering connection. If you need to refer to EC2 instances and other AWS resources in other VPCs, consider creating a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-private.html">Private Hosted Zone</a> using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/" title="">Amazon Route 53</a>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ivpc_make_zone_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Unlike VPC peering within a single region, you cannot reference security groups across Inter-Region VPC Peering. Also, jumbo frames cannot be sent between regions.</p>

<p>We launched some important new EC2 instance types and features at <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a>. I’ve already told you about the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/m5-the-next-generation-of-general-purpose-ec2-instances/">M5</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-b-instances-fast-dense-storage-for-big-data-applications/">H1</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-t2-unlimited-going-beyond-the-burst-with-high-performance/">T2 Unlimited</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-bare-metal-instances-with-direct-access-to-hardware/">Bare Metal</a> instances, and about <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">Spot</a> features such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ec2-update-streamlined-access-to-spot-capacity-smooth-price-changes-instance-hibernation/">Hibernation</a> and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ec2-update-streamlined-access-to-spot-capacity-smooth-price-changes-instance-hibernation/">New Pricing Model</a>. Randall told you about the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/keeping-time-with-amazon-time-sync-service/">Amazon Time Sync Service</a>. Today I would like to tell you about two of the features that we launched: Spread placement groups and Launch Templates. Both features are available in the EC2 Console and from the EC2 APIs, and can be used in all of the AWS Regions in the “aws” partition:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ec2_menu_1.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Launch Templates</strong></span><br /> You can use launch templates to store the instance, network, security, storage, and advanced parameters that you use to launch EC2 instances, and can also include any desired tags. Each template can include any desired subset of the full collection of parameters. You can, for example, define common configuration parameters such as tags or network configurations in a template, and allow the other parameters to be specified as part of the actual launch.</p> 
<p>Templates give you the power to set up a consistent launch environment that spans instances launched in On-Demand and Spot form, as well as through EC2 Auto Scaling and as part of a Spot Fleet. You can use them to implement organization-wide standards and to enforce best practices, and you can give your IAM users the ability to launch instances via templates while withholding the ability to do so via the underlying APIs.</p> 
<p>Templates are versioned and you can use any desired version when you launch an instance. You can create templates from scratch, base them on the previous version, or copy the parameters from a running instance.</p> 
<p>Here’s how you create a launch template in the Console:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/lt_prod_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Here’s how to include network interfaces, storage volumes, tags, and security groups:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/lt_net_more_1.png" /></p> 
<p>And here’s how to specify advanced and specialized parameters:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/lt_advanced_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You don’t have to specify values for all of these parameters in your templates; enter the values that are common to multiple instances or launches and specify the rest at launch time.</p> 
<p>When you click Create launch template, the template is created and can be used to launch On-Demand instances, create Auto Scaling Groups, and create Spot Fleets:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/lt_greenery_2.png" /></p> 
<p>The <strong>Launch Instance</strong> button now gives you the option to launch from a template:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/con_li_lt_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Simply choose the template and the version, and finalize all of the launch parameters:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/lt_launch_picky_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You can also manage your templates and template versions from the Console:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/lt_action_1.png" /></p> 
<p>To learn more about this feature, read <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html">Launching an Instance from a Launch Template</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Spread Placement Groups</strong></span><br /> Spread placement groups indicate that you do not want the instances in the group to share the same underlying hardware. Applications that rely on a small number of critical instances can launch them in a spread placement group to reduce the odds that one hardware failure will impact more than one instance. Here are a couple of things to keep in mind when you use spread placement groups:</p> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em"><strong>Availability Zones</strong> – A single spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones. You can have a maximum of seven running instances per Availability Zone per group.</li> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em"><strong>Unique Hardware</strong> – Launch requests can fail if there is insufficient unique hardware available. The situation changes over time as overall usage changes and as we add additional hardware; you can retry failed requests at a later time.</li> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em"><strong>Instance Types</strong> – You can launch a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html#placement-groups-spread">wide variety</a> of M4, M5, C3, R3, R4, X1, X1e, D2, H1, I2, I3, HS1, F1, G2, G3, P2, and P3 instances types in spread placement groups.</li> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em"><strong>Reserved Instances</strong> – Instances launched into a spread placement group can make use of reserved capacity. However, you cannot currently reserve capacity for a placement group and could receive an ICE (Insufficient Capacity Error) even if you have some RI’s available.</li> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em"><strong>Applicability</strong> – You cannot use spread placement groups in conjunction with Dedicated Instances or Dedicated Hosts.</li> 
<p>You can create and use spread placement groups from the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/powershell/" title="">AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell</a>, and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/" title="">AWS SDKs</a>. The console has a new feature that will help you to learn how to use the command line:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ec2_pg_create_2.png" /></p> 
<p>You can specify an existing placement group or create a new one when you launch an EC2 instance:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ec2_pg_use_1.png" /></p> 
<p>To learn more, read about <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html">Placement Groups</a>.</p> 
<p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffbarr">Jeff</a>;</p> 
<p><strong>PS</strong> – There’s no charge for either feature.</p>

<p>I’ve been talking about scalability for servers and other cloud resources for a very long time! <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/sometimes_you_n/">Back in 2006</a>, I wrote “This is the new world of scalable, on-demand web services. Pay for what you need and use, and not a byte more.” Shortly after we launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" title="">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</a>, we made it easy for you to do this with the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-load-balancing-automatic-scaling-and-cloud-monitoring-services/">simultaneous launch</a> of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing" title="">Elastic Load Balancing</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling">EC2 Auto Scaling</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" title="">Amazon CloudWatch</a>. Since then we have added Auto Scaling to other AWS services including <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/automatic-scaling-with-amazon-ecs/">ECS</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-auto-scaling-for-ec2-spot-fleets/">Spot Fleets</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-auto-scaling-for-amazon-dynamodb/">DynamoDB</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/amazon-aurora-now-supports-auto-scaling-for-aurora-replicas/">Aurora</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-appstream-2-0-features-fleet-auto-scaling-image-builder-saml-metrics-and-fleet-management/">AppStream 2.0</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-auto-scaling-for-emr-clusters/">EMR</a>. We have also added features such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-target-tracking-policies-for-ec2-auto-scaling/">target tracking</a> to make it easier for you to scale based on the metric that is most appropriate for your application.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Introducing AWS Auto Scaling</strong></span><br /> Today we are making it easier for you to use the Auto Scaling features of multiple AWS services from a single user interface with the introduction of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling" title="">AWS Auto Scaling</a>. This new service unifies and builds on our existing, service-specific, scaling features. It operates on any desired EC2 Auto Scaling groups, EC2 Spot Fleets, ECS tasks, DynamoDB tables, DynamoDB Global Secondary Indexes, and Aurora Replicas that are part of your application, as described by an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" title="">AWS CloudFormation</a> stack or in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/" title="">AWS Elastic Beanstalk</a> (we’re also exploring some other ways to flag a set of resources as an application for use with <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span>).</p> 
<p>You no longer need to set up alarms and scaling actions for each resource and each service. Instead, you simply point <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span> at your application and select the services and resources of interest. Then you select the desired scaling option for each one, and <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span> will do the rest, helping you to discover the scalable resources and then creating a scaling plan that addresses the resources of interest.</p> 
<p>If you have tried to use any of our Auto Scaling options in the past, you undoubtedly understand the trade-offs involved in choosing scaling thresholds. <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span> gives you a variety of scaling options: You can optimize for availability, keeping plenty of resources in reserve in order to meet sudden spikes in demand. You can optimize for costs, running close to the line and accepting the possibility that you will tax your resources if that spike arrives. Alternatively, you can aim for the middle, with a generous but not excessive level of spare capacity. In addition to optimizing for availability, cost, or a blend of both, you can also set a custom scaling threshold. In each case, <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span> will create scaling policies on your behalf, including appropriate upper and lower bounds for each resource.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS Auto Scaling in Action</strong></span><br /> I will use <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span> on a simple CloudFormation stack consisting of an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances and a pair of DynamoDB tables. I start by removing the existing Scaling Policies from my Auto Scaling group:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_delete_old_ec2_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I open up the new <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/awsautoscaling/home">Auto Scaling Console</a> and selecting the stack:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_cons_main_2.png" /></p> 
<p>Behind the scenes, Elastic Beanstalk applications are always launched via a CloudFormation stack. In the screen shot above, <strong>awseb-e-sdwttqizbp-stack</strong> is an Elastic Beanstalk application that I launched.</p> 
<p>I can click on any stack to learn more about it before proceeding:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_cons_my_stack_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I select the desired stack and click on <strong>Next</strong> to proceed. Then I enter a name for my scaling plan and choose the resources that I’d like it to include:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_setup_scaling_2.png" /></p> 
<p>I choose the scaling strategy for each type of resource:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_setup_scaling_ec2_as_1.png" /></p> 
<p>After I have selected the desired strategies, I click <strong>Next</strong> to proceed. Then I review the proposed scaling plan, and click <strong>Create scaling plan</strong> to move ahead:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_make_my_plan_2.png" /></p> 
<p>The scaling plan is created and in effect within a few minutes:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_a_man_a_plan_panama_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I can click on the plan to learn more:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_the_plan_details_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I can also inspect each scaling policy:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_policy_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I tested my new policy by applying a load to the initial EC2 instance, and watched the scale out activity take place:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_ec2_scale_up_happening_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I also took a look at the CloudWatch metrics for the EC2 Auto Scaling group:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/as_asg_metrics_1.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> We are launching <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span> today in the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span>, <span title="">US East (Ohio)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span>, and <span title="">Asia Pacific (Singapore)</span> Regions today, with more to follow. There’s no charge for <span title="">AWS Auto Scaling</span>; you pay only for the CloudWatch Alarms that it creates and any AWS resources that you consume.</p> 
<p>As is often the case with our new services, this is just the first step on what we hope to be a long and interesting journey! We have a long roadmap, and we’ll be adding new features and options throughout 2018 in response to your feedback.</p>

<p>We expand AWS by picking a geographic area (which we call a Region) and then building multiple, isolated Availability Zones in that area. Each Availability Zone (AZ) has multiple Internet connections and power connections to multiple grids.</p> 
<p>Today I am happy to announce that we are opening our 50<sup>th</sup> AWS Availability Zone, with the addition of a third AZ to the <span title="">EU (London)</span> Region. This will give you additional flexibility to architect highly scalable, fault-tolerant applications that run across multiple AZs in the UK.</p> 
<p>Since launching the <span title="">EU (London)</span> Region, we have seen an ever-growing set of customers, particularly in the public sector and in regulated industries, use AWS for new and innovative applications. Here are a couple of examples, courtesy of my AWS colleagues in the UK:</p> 
<p><strong>Enterprise</strong> – Some of the UK’s most respected enterprises are using AWS to transform their businesses, including <a href="http://www.bbc.com/">BBC</a>, <a href="http://home.bt.com/">BT</a>, <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en.html">Deloitte</a>, and <a href="https://www.travisperkins.co.uk/">Travis Perkins</a>. Travis Perkins is one of the largest suppliers of building materials in the UK and is implementing the biggest systems and business change in its history, including an all-in migration of its data centers to AWS.</p> 
<p><strong>Startups</strong> – Cross-border payments company <a href="https://www.currencycloud.com/en-us/">Currencycloud</a> has migrated its entire payments production, and demo platform to AWS resulting in a 30% saving on their infrastructure costs. <a href="https://www.clearscore.com/">Clearscore</a>, with plans to disrupting the credit score industry, has also chosen to host their entire platform on AWS. <a href="https://www.underwriteme.co.uk/">UnderwriteMe</a> is using the EU (London) Region to offer an underwriting platform to their customers as a managed service.</p> 
<p><strong>Public Sector</strong> -The <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/">Met Office</a> chose AWS to support the <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/mobile-digital-services/weather-app">Met Office Weather App</a>, available for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1068146838?pt=294279&amp;ct=Desktop%20Apps%20page&amp;mt=8">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.gov.metoffice.weather.android&amp;referrer=utm_source%3DMet%2520Office%2520Desktop%2520site%2520apps%2520page">Android</a> phones. Since the Met Office Weather App went live in January 2016, it has attracted more than 4.5 million downloads. Using AWS, the Met Office has been able to increase agility, speed, and scalability while reducing costs. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency">Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency</a> (DVLA) is using the <span title="">EU (London)</span> Region for services such as the Strategic Card Payments platform, which helps the agency achieve PCI DSS compliance.</p> 
<p>The AWS <span title="">EU (London)</span> Region has <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-uk-region-achieves-public-services-network-psn-assurance/">achieved Public Services Network (PSN) assurance</a>, which provides UK Public Sector customers with an assured infrastructure on which to build UK Public Sector services. In conjunction with AWS’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/01/standardized-architecture-for-uk-official-in-the-aws-cloud-quick-start-reference-deployment/">Standardized Architecture for UK-OFFICIAL</a>, PSN assurance enables UK Public Sector organizations to move their UK-OFFICIAL classified data to the <span title="">EU (London)</span> Region in a controlled and risk-managed manner.</p> 
<p>For a complete list of AWS Regions and Services, visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">AWS Global Infrastructure</a> page. As always, pricing for services in the Region can be found on the detail pages; visit our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/products/">Cloud Products</a> page to get started.</p>

<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ces_aces_1.png">INRIX</a>. Bryan’s talk provided a glimpse into the future of transportation, centering around four principle attributes, often abbreviated as ACES:</p> 
<p><strong>Autonomous</strong> – Cars and trucks are gaining the ability to scan and to make sense of their environments and to navigate without human input.</p> 
<p><strong>Connected</strong> – Vehicles of all types have the ability to take advantage of bidirectional connections (either full-time or intermittent) to other cars and to cloud-based resources. They can upload road and performance data, communicate with each other to <a href="http://econosystemics.com/?p=730">run in packs</a>, and take advantage of traffic and weather data.</p> 
<p><strong>Electric</strong> – Continued development of battery and motor technology, will make electrics vehicles more convenient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly.</p> 
<p><strong>Shared</strong> – Ride-sharing services will change usage from an ownership model to an as-a-service model (sound familiar?).</p> 
<p>Individually and in combination, these emerging attributes mean that the cars and trucks we will see and use in the decade to come will be markedly different than those of the past.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>On the Road with AWS</strong></span><br /> AWS customers are already using our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot" title="">AWS IoT</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/">edge computing</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/" title="">Amazon Machine Learning</a>, and <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa">Alexa</a> products to bring this future to life – vehicle manufacturers, their tier 1 suppliers, and AutoTech startups all use AWS for their ACES initiatives. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass" title="">AWS Greengrass</a> is playing an important role here, attracting design wins and helping our customers to add processing power and machine learning inferencing at the edge.</p> 
<p>AWS customer <a href="http://www.aptiv.com/">Aptiv</a> (formerly Delphi) talked about their Automated Mobility on Demand (AMoD) smart vehicle architecture in a <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a> session. Aptiv’s AMoD platform will use Greengrass and microservices to drive the onboard user experience, along with edge processing, monitoring, and control. Here’s an overview:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ces_aptiv_amod_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Another customer, <a href="https://www.denso.com/global/en/">Denso</a> of Japan (one of the world’s largest suppliers of auto components and software) is using Greengrass and AWS IoT to support their vision of <a href="https://www.denso.com/global/en/innovation/technology/maas/">Mobility as a Service</a> (MaaS). Here’s a <a href="https://youtu.be/cu9glnsxgYM?t=35m27s">video</a>:</p> 
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/cu9glnsxgYM?t=35m27s"><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ces_ri_denso_1.png" /></a></p> 
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">AWS at CES</span></strong><br /> The AWS team will be out in force at CES in Las Vegas and would love to talk to you. They’ll be running demos that show how AWS can help to bring innovation and personalization to connected and autonomous vehicles.</p> 
<p><strong>Personalized In-Vehicle Experience</strong> – This demo shows how AWS AI and Machine Learning can be used to create a highly personalized and branded in-vehicle experience. It makes use of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lex" title="">Amazon Lex</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/polly" title="">Polly</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/" title="">Amazon Rekognition</a>, but the design is flexible and can be used with other services as well. The demo encompasses driver registration, login and startup (including facial recognition), voice assistance for contextual guidance, personalized e-commerce, and vehicle control. Here’s the architecture for the voice assistance:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ces_demo1_1.png" /></p> 
<p><strong>Connected Vehicle Solution</strong> – This demo shows how a connected vehicle can combine local and cloud intelligence, using edge computing and machine learning at the edge. It handles intermittent connections and uses <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/deeplens/" title="">AWS DeepLens</a> to train a model that responds to distracted drivers. Here’s the overall architecture, as described in our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/iot/connected-vehicle-solution/">Connected Vehicle Solution</a>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ces_demo2_1.png" /></p> 
<p><strong>Digital Content Delivery </strong>– This demo will show how a customer uses a web-based 3D configurator to build and personalize their vehicle. It will also show high resolution (4K) 3D image and an optional immersive AR/VR experience, both designed for use within a dealership.</p> 
<p><strong>Autonomous Driving</strong> – This demo will showcase the AWS services that can be used to build autonomous vehicles. There’s a 1/16th scale model vehicle powered and driven by Greengrass and an overview of a new AWS Autonomous Toolkit. As part of the demo, attendees drive the car, training a model via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/" title="">Amazon SageMaker</a> for subsequent on-board inferencing, powered by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/ml/">Greengrass ML Inferencing</a>.</p> 
<p>To speak to one of my colleagues or to set up a time to see the demos, check out the <a href="http://go.amazonsellerservices.com/ces18/aws">Visit AWS at CES 2018</a> page.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Some Resources</strong></span><br /> If you are interested in this topic and want to learn more, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/automotive/">AWS for Automotive</a> page is a great starting point, with discussions on connected vehicles &amp; mobility, autonomous vehicle development, and digital customer engagement.</p> 
<p>When you are ready to start building a connected vehicle, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/iot/connected-vehicle-solution/">AWS Connected Vehicle Solution</a> contains a reference architecture that combines local computing, sophisticated event rules, and cloud-based data processing and storage. You can use this solution to accelerate your own connected vehicle projects.</p>

<p>Happy 2018! I am looking forward to getting back to my usual routine, working with our teams to learn about their upcoming launches and then writing blog posts to bring the news to you. Right now I am still catching up on a few launches and announcements from late 2017.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/"><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/dc_aag_1.png">AWS Direct Connect</a>. AWS customers all over the world use Direct Connect to create dedicated network connections from their premises to AWS in order to reduce their network costs, increase throughput, and to pursue a more consistent network experience.</p> 
<p>We added ten new locations to our Direct Connect roster in December, all of which offer both 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps connectivity, along with partner-supplied options for speeds below 1 Gbps. Here are the newest locations, along withe the data centers and associated AWS Regions:</p>

<p>I’m getting ready to wrap up my work for the year, cleaning up my inbox and catching up on a few recent AWS launches that happened at and shortly after <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a>.</p> 
<p>Last week we launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/" title="">Amazon Linux 2</a>. This is modern version of Linux, designed to meet the security, stability, and productivity needs of enterprise environments while giving you timely access to new tools and features. It also includes all of the things that made the Amazon Linux AMI popular, including AWS integration, <a href="https://cloud-init.io/">cloud-init</a>, a secure default configuration, regular security updates, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support</a>. From that base, we have added many new features including:</p> 
<p><strong>Long-Term Support</strong> – You can use <span title="">Amazon Linux 2</span> in situations where you want to stick with a single major version of Linux for an extended period of time, perhaps to avoid re-qualifying your applications too frequently. This build (2017.12) is a candidate for LTS status; the final determination will be made based on feedback in the <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=228">Amazon Linux Discussion Forum</a>. Long-term support for the Amazon Linux 2 LTS build will include security updates, bug fixes, user-space Application Binary Interface (ABI), and user-space Application Programming Interface (API) compatibility for 5 years.</p> 
<p><strong>Extras Library</strong> – You can now get fast access to fresh, new functionality while keeping your base OS image stable and lightweight. The Amazon Linux Extras Library eliminates the age-old tradeoff between OS stability and access to fresh software. It contains open source databases, languages, and more, each packaged together with any needed dependencies.</p> 
<p><strong>Tuned Kernel</strong> – You have access to the latest 4.9 LTS kernel, with support for the latest EC2 features and tuned to run efficiently in AWS and other virtualized environments.</p> 
<p><strong>Systemd</strong> – <span title="">Amazon Linux 2</span> includes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd">systemd</a> init system, designed to provide better boot performance and increased control over individual services and groups of interdependent services. For example, you can indicate that Service B must be started only after Service A is fully started, or that Service C should start on a change in network connection status.</p> 
<p><strong>Wide Availabilty</strong> – <span title="">Amazon Linux 2</span> is available in all AWS Regions in AMI and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/amazonlinux/">Docker image</a> form. <a href="https://cdn.amazonlinux.com/os-images/2017.12.0.20171212.2/">Virtual machine images</a> for Hyper-V, KVM, VirtualBox, and VMware are also available. You can build and test your applications on your laptop or in your own data center and then deploy them to AWS.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Launching an Instance</strong></span><br /> You can launch an instance in all of the usual ways – <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/powershell/" title="">AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell</a>, <code><a title="undefined" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html" target="null">RunInstances</a></code>, and via a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" title="">AWS CloudFormation</a> template. I’ll use the Console:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/al2_console_launch_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I’m interested in the Extras Library; here’s how I see which topics (lists of packages) are available:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/al2_see_extras_2.png" /></p> 
<p>As you can see, the library includes languages, editors, and web tools that receive frequent updates. Each topic contains all of dependencies that are needed to install the package on <span title="">Amazon Linux 2</span>. For example, the <strong>Rust</strong> topic includes the <a href="http://alexcrichton.com/cmake-rs/cmake/index.html">cmake</a> build system for Rust, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo">cargo</a> for Rust package maintenance, and the LLVM-based compiler toolchain for Rust.</p> 
<p>Here’s how I install a topic (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/news/NEWS.25.3">Emacs 25.3</a>):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/al2_install_extras_emacs_1.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>SNS Updates</strong></span><br /> Many AWS customers use the Amazon Linux AMIs as a starting point for their own AMIs. If you do this and would like to kick off your build process whenever a new AMI is released, you can <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/amazon-linux-ami-basics.html#linux-ami-notifications">subscribe to an SNS topic</a>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/al2_sub_sns_topic_2.png" /></p> 
<p>You can be notified by email, invoke a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> function, and so forth.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/" title="">Amazon Linux 2</a> is available now and you can start using it in the cloud and on-premises today! To learn more, read the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/release-notes/">Amazon Linux 2 LTS Candidate (2017.12) Release Notes</a>.</p>

<p>AWS is certified under the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">EU-US Privacy Shield</a>, and the AWS Data Processing Addendum (DPA) is GDPR-ready and available now to all AWS customers to help them prepare for May 25, 2018 when the GDPR becomes enforceable. The current AWS DPA, as well as the AWS GDPR DPA, allows customers to transfer personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in compliance with European Union (EU) data protection laws. AWS also adheres to the <a href="https://cispe.cloud/">Cloud Infrastructure Service Providers in Europe</a> (CISPE) <a href="https://cispe.cloud/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>. The CISPE Code of Conduct helps customers ensure that AWS is using appropriate data protection standards to protect their data, consistent with the GDPR. In addition, AWS offers a wide range of services and features to help customers meet the requirements of the GDPR, including services for access controls, monitoring, logging, and encryption.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>From Our Customers</strong></span><br /> Many AWS customers are preparing to use this new Region. Here’s a small sample:</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.societegenerale.com/en/home">Societe Generale</a>, one of the largest banks in France and the world, has accelerated their digital transformation while working with AWS. They developed SG Research, an application that makes reports from Societe Generale’s analysts available to corporate customers in order to improve the decision-making process for investments. The new AWS Region will reduce latency between applications running in the cloud and in their French data centers.</p> 
<p><a href="http://www.sncf.com/">SNCF</a> is the national railway company of France. Their mobile app, powered by AWS, delivers real-time traffic information to 14 million riders. Extreme weather, traffic events, holidays, and engineering works can cause usage to peak at hundreds of thousands of users per second. They are planning to use machine learning and big data to add predictive features to the app.</p> 
<p><a href="http://www.radiofrance.fr/">Radio France</a>, the French public radio broadcaster, offers seven national networks, and uses AWS to accelerate its innovation and stay competitive.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.restosducoeur.org/">Les Restos du Coeur</a>, a French charity that provides assistance to the needy, delivering food packages and participating in their social and economic integration back into French society. Les Restos du Coeur is using AWS for its CRM system to track the assistance given to each of their beneficiaries and the impact this is having on their lives.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.alloresto.fr/">AlloResto</a> by JustEat (a leader in the <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20150717-future-food-tech-french-american-startups-wine-soylent-supercook-ruche">French FoodTech</a> industry), is using AWS to to scale during traffic peaks and to accelerate their innovation process.</p>
