<p>Amazon SageMaker continues to iterate quickly and release new features on behalf of customers. Starting today, SageMaker adds support for many new instance types, local testing with the SDK, and Apache MXNet 1.1.0 and Tensorflow 1.6.0. Let’s take a quick look at each of these updates.</p> 
<h3>New Instance Types</h3> 
<p>Amazon SageMaker customers now have additional options for right-sizing their workloads for notebooks, training, and hosting. Notebook instances now support almost all T2, M4, P2, and P3 instance types with the exception of t2.micro, t2.small, and m4.large instances. Model training now supports nearly all M4, M5, C4, C5, P2, and P3 instances with the exception of m4.large, c4.large, and c5.large instances. Finally, model hosting now supports nearly all T2, M4, M5, C4, C5, P2, and P3 instances with the exception of m4.large instances. Many customers can take advantage of the newest P3, C5, and M5 instances to get the best price/performance for their workloads. Customers also take advantage of the burstable compute model on T2 instances for endpoints or notebooks that are used less frequently.</p> 
<h3>Open Sourced Containers, Local Mode, and TensorFlow 1.6.0 and MXNet 1.1.0</h3> 
<p>Today Amazon SageMaker has open sourced the <a href="https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-mxnet-containers">MXNet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-tensorflow-containers">Tensorflow</a> deep learning containers that power the <a href="https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk#mxnet-sagemaker-estimators">MXNet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk#tensorflow-sagemaker-estimators">Tensorflow</a> estimators in the SageMaker SDK. The ability to write Python scripts that conform to simple interface is still one of my favorite SageMaker features and now those containers can be additionally customized to include any additional libraries. You can download these containers locally to iterate and experiment which can accelerate your debugging cycle. When you’re ready go from local testing to production training and hosting you just change one line of code.</p> 
<p>These containers launch with support for Tensorflow 1.6.0 and MXNet 1.1.0 as well. Tensorflow has a number of new 1.6.0 features including support for CUDA 9.0, cuDNN 7, and AVX instructions which allows for significant speedups in many training applications. MXNet 1.1.0 adds a number of new features including a Text API <a href="https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/contrib/text.html"><code>mxnet.text</code></a> with support for text processing, indexing, glossaries, and more. Two of the really cool pre-trained embeddings included are <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/">GloVe</a> and <a href="https://fasttext.cc/">fastText</a>.<br /> &lt;</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> All of the features mentioned above are available today. As always please let us know on Twitter or in the comments below if you have any questions or if you’re building something interesting. Now, if you’ll excuse me I’m going to go experiment with some of those new MXNet APIs!</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" title="">Amazon ECS</a> now includes integrated service discovery. This makes it possible for an ECS service to automatically register itself with a predictable and friendly DNS name in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/" title="">Amazon Route 53</a>. As your services scale up or down in response to load or container health, the Route 53 hosted zone is kept up to date, allowing other services to lookup where they need to make connections based on the state of each service. You can see a demo of service discovery in an imaginary social networking app over at: <a href="https://servicediscovery.ranman.com/">https://servicediscovery.ranman.com/</a>.</p> 
<h3>Service Discovery</h3> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/28/ECS-Service-Discovery-1024x865.png" /><br /> Part of the transition to microservices and modern architectures involves having dynamic, autoscaling, and robust services that can respond quickly to failures and changing loads. Your services probably have complex dependency graphs of services they rely on and services they provide. A modern architectural best practice is to loosely couple these services by allowing them to specify their own dependencies, but this can be complicated in dynamic environments as your individual services are forced to find their own connection points.</p> 
<p>Traditional approaches to service discovery like consul, etcd, or zookeeper all solve this problem well, but they require provisioning and maintaining additional infrastructure or installation of agents in your containers or on your instances. Previously, to ensure that services were able to discover and connect with each other, you had to configure and run your own service discovery system or connect every service to a load balancer. Now, you can enable service discovery for your containerized services in the ECS console, AWS CLI, or using the ECS API.</p> 
<h3>Introducing Amazon Route 53 Service Registry and Auto Naming APIs</h3> 
<p>Amazon ECS Service Discovery works by communicating with the Amazon Route 53 Service Registry and Auto Naming APIs. Since we haven’t talked about it before on this blog, I want to briefly outline how these Route 53 APIs work. First, some vocabulary:</p> 
<li><b>Namespaces</b> – A namespace specifies a domain name you want to route traffic to (e.g. internal, local, corp). You can think of it as a logical boundary between which services should be able to discover each other. You can create a namespace with a call to the <code>aws servicediscovery create-private-dns-namespace</code> command or in the ECS console. Namespaces are roughly equivalent to hosted zones in Route 53. A namespace contains services, our next vocabulary word.</li> 
<li><b>Service</b> – A service is a specific application or set of applications in your namespace like “auth”, “timeline”, or “worker”. A service contains service instances.</li> 
<li><b>Service Instance</b> – A service instance contains information about how Route 53 should respond to DNS queries for a resource.</li> 
<p>Route 53 provides APIs to create: namespaces, <code>A</code> records per task IP, and <code>SRV</code> records per task IP + port.</p> 
<p>When we ask Route 53 for something like: <code>worker.corp</code> we should get back a set of possible IPs that could fulfill that request. If the application we’re connecting to exposes dynamic ports then the calling application can easily query the <code>SRV</code> record to get more information.</p> 
<p>ECS service discovery is built on top of the Route 53 APIs and manages all of the underlying API calls for you. Now that we understand how the service registry, works lets take a look at the ECS side to see service discovery in action.</p> 
<h3>Amazon ECS Service Discovery</h3> 
<p>Let’s launch an application with service discovery! First, I’ll create two task definitions: “flask-backend” and “flask-worker”. Both are simple <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/" title="AWS Fargate">AWS Fargate</a> tasks with a single container serving HTTP requests. I’ll have flask-backend ask <code>worker.corp</code> to do some work and I’ll return the response as well as the address Route 53 returned for <code>worker</code>. Something like the code below:</p> 
<code>@app.route(&quot;/&quot;)
namespace = os.getenv(&quot;namespace&quot;)
worker_host = &quot;worker&quot; + namespace
def backend():
r = requests.get(&quot;http://&quot;+worker_host)
worker = socket.gethostbyname(worker_host)
return &quot;Worker Message: {]\nFrom: {}&quot;.format(r.content, worker)
</code> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now, with my containers and task definitions in place, I’ll create a service in the console.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/26/2018-03-26_06-28-34-1-1024x727.png" /></p> 
<p>As I move to step two in the service wizard I’ll&nbsp;fill out the service discovery section and have ECS create a new namespace for me.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/26/2018-03-26_06-30-58.png" /></p> 
<p>I’ll also tell ECS to monitor the health of the tasks in my service and add or remove them from Route 53 as needed. Then I’ll set a TTL of 10 seconds on the A records we’ll use.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/26/2018-03-26_06-31-16.png" /></p> 
<p>I’ll repeat those same steps for my “worker” service and after a minute or so most of my tasks should be up and running.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/26/2018-03-26_06-35-08-1024x471.png" /></p> 
<p>Over in the Route 53 console I can see all the records for my tasks!<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/26/2018-03-26_07-00-09-1024x460.png" /></p> 
<p>We can use the Route 53 service discovery APIs to list all of our available services and tasks and programmatically reach out to each one. We could easily extend to any number of services past just backend and worker. I’ve created a simple demo of an imaginary social network with services like “auth”, “feed”, “timeline”, “worker”, “user” and more here: <a href="https://servicediscovery.ranman.com/">https://servicediscovery.ranman.com/</a>. You can see the code used to run that page on <a href="https://github.com/ranman/ecs-service-discovery-demo">github</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> Amazon ECS service discovery is available now in <span title="">US East (N. Virginia)</span>, <span title="">US East (Ohio)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, and <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span>. AWS Fargate is currently only available in <span title="">US East (N. Virginia)</span>. When you use ECS service discovery, you pay for the Route 53 resources that you consume, including each namespace that you create, and for the lookup queries your services make. Container level health checks are provided at no cost. For more information on pricing check out the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html#service-discovery-pricing">documentation</a>.</p> 
<p>Please let us know what you’ll be building or refactoring with service discovery either in the comments or on Twitter!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" title="">Amazon DynamoDB</a> team is back with another useful feature hot on the heels of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-encryption-at-rest-for-dynamodb/">encryption at rest</a>. At <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a> 2017 we launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-amazon-dynamodb-global-tables-and-on-demand-backup/">global tables and on-demand backup and restore</a> of your DynamoDB tables and today we’re launching continuous backups with point-in-time recovery (PITR).</p> 
<p>You can enable continuous backups with a single click in the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>, a simple API call, or with the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>. DynamoDB can back up your data with per-second granularity and restore to any single second from the time PITR was enabled up to the prior 35 days. We built this feature to protect against accidental writes or deletes.&nbsp;If a developer runs a script against production instead of staging or if someone fat-fingers a DeleteItem call, PITR has you covered. We also built it for the scenarios you can’t normally predict. You can still keep your on-demand backups for as long as needed for archival purposes but PITR works as additional insurance against accidental loss of data. Let’s see how this works.</p> 
<h3>Continuous Backup</h3> 
<p>To enable this feature in the console we navigate to our table and select the <b>Backups</b> tab. From there simply click <b>Enable</b> to turn on the feature. I could also&nbsp;turn on continuous backups&nbsp;via the UpdateContinuousBackups API call.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/18/ddb_3.png" /></p> 
<p>Let’s imagine a scenario where I have a lot of old user profiles that I want to delete.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/18/ddb_2-1-1024x575.png" /></p> 
<p>I really only want to send service updates to our active users based on their <code>last_update</code> date. I decided to write a quick Python script to delete all the users that haven’t used my service in a while.</p> 
<code class="lang-python">import boto3
table = boto3.resource(&quot;dynamodb&quot;).Table(&quot;VerySuperImportantTable&quot;)
items = table.scan(
FilterExpression=&quot;last_update &gt;= :date&quot;,
ExpressionAttributeValues={&quot;:date&quot;: &quot;2014-01-01T00:00:00&quot;},
ProjectionExpression=&quot;ImportantId&quot;
)['Items']
print(&quot;Deleting {} Items! Dangerous.&quot;.format(len(items)))
with table.batch_writer() as batch:
for item in items:
batch.delete_item(Key=item)</code> 
<p>Great! This should delete all those pesky non-users of my service that haven’t logged in since 2013. So,— CTRL+C CTRL+C CTRL+C CTRL+C (interrupt the currently executing command).</p> 
<p>Yikes! Do you see where I went wrong? I’ve just deleted my most important users! Oh, no! Where I had a greater-than sign, I meant to put a less-than! Quick, before Jeff Barr can see, I’m going to restore the table. (I probably could have prevented that typo with Boto 3’s handy <a href="http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/customizations/dynamodb.html#dynamodb-conditions">DynamoDB conditions</a>: <code class="lang-python">Attr(&quot;last_update&quot;).lt(&quot;2014-01-01T00:00:00&quot;)</code>)</p> 
<h3>Restoring</h3> 
<p>Luckily for me, restoring a table is easy. In the console I’ll navigate to the <b>Backups</b> tab for my table and click <b>Restore to point-in-time</b>.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/23/ddb-1024x387.png" /></p> 
<p>I’ll specify the time (a few seconds before I started my deleting spree) and a name for the table I’m restoring to.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/18/ddb_4.png" /></p> 
<p>For a relatively small and evenly distributed table like mine, the restore is quite fast.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/18/ddb_5.png" /></p> 
<p>The time it takes to restore a table varies based on multiple factors and restore times are not neccesarily coordinated with the size of the table. If your dataset is evenly distributed across your primary keys you’ll be able to take advanatage of parallelization which will speed up your restores.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Learn More &amp; Try It Yourself</strong></span><br /> There’s plenty more to learn about this new feature in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/PointInTimeRecovery.html">documentation here</a>.</p> 
<p>Pricing for continuous backups is detailed on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/#Continuous_backup_and_point-in-time_recovery">DynamoDB Pricing Pages</a>. Pricing varies by region and is based on the current size of the table and indexes. For example, in <span title="">US East (N. Virginia)</span> you pay $0.20 per GB based on the size of the data and all local secondary indexes.</p> 
<p>A few things to note:</p> 
<li>PITR works with encrypted tables.</li> 
<li>If you disable PITR and later reenable it, you reset the start time from which you can recover.</li> 
<li>Just like on-demand backups, there are no performance or availability impacts to enabling this feature.</li> 
<li>Stream settings, Time To Live settings, PITR settings, tags, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" title="">Amazon CloudWatch</a> alarms, and auto scaling policies are not copied to the restored table.</li> 
<li>Jeff, it turns out, knew I restored the table all along because every PITR API call is recorded in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/" title="">AWS CloudTrail</a>.</li> 
<p>PITR is available in the US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Canada (Central), EU (Frankfurt), EU (Ireland), EU (London), and South America (Sao Paulo) Regions starting today.</p> 
<p>Let us know how you’re going to use continuous backups and PITR on Twitter and in the comments.<br /> – <a href="https://twitter.com/jrhunt/" title="Randall's Twitter">Randall</a></p>

<p>Mid-march in the USA means millions of people watching, and betting on, college basketball (I live here but I didn’t make the rules). As the NCAA college championship continues I wanted to briefly highlight the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/wesleypasfield">Wesley Pasfield</a> one of our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services/">Professional Services</a> Machine Learning Specialists. Wesley was able to take data from <a href="https://kenpom.com">kenpom.com</a> and <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/">College Basketball Reference</a> to build a model predicting the outcome of March Madness using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/" title="">Amazon SageMaker</a> built-in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/xgboost.html">XGBoost</a> algorithm.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/22/march_madness-1024x463.png" /></p> 
<p>Wesley walks us through grabbing the data, performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA in the data science lingo), reshaping the data for the xgboost algorithm, using the SageMaker SDK to create a training job for two different models, and finally creating a SageMaker inference endpoint for serving predictions at <a href="https://cbbpredictions.com/">https://cbbpredictions.com/</a>. Check out <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/predict-march-madness-using-amazon-sagemaker/">part one</a> of the post and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/building-a-march-madness-predictor-application-supported-by-amazon-sagemaker/">part two.</a></p> 
<p>Pretty cool right? Why not open the notebook and give the xgboost algorithm a try? Just know that there are a few caveats to the predictions so don’t go making your champion prediction just yet!</p>

<p>We launched <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/gs-step-four-sync-files.html">EFS File Sync</a> a few days before <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a> 2017 and I finally have time to tell you about it!</p> 
<p>If you need to move a large collection of files from an on-premises or in-cloud file system to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/efs" title="">Amazon Elastic File System</a>, this tool is for you. Simple, single-threaded command line tools such as <code>cp</code> and <code>rsync</code> predate the cloud and cannot deliver the throughput required to move massive amounts of data from place to place. These tools are generally used as building blocks, often within scripts that take care of scheduling, orchestration, and network security.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Secure &amp; Parallel</strong></span><br /> EFS File Sync uses a secure, highly parallel data transfer mechanism that can run up to 5 times faster than the tools I mentioned above. It is available as an agent that runs within VMware ESXi or on an EC2 instance, and accesses the source file system via NFS (v3 and v4), and can be used in all AWS Regions where EFS is available. Because the agent is responsible for initiating all communication with AWS you don’t need to set up VPNs or allow inbound connections through your firewall.</p> 
<p>You can launch, control, and monitor the agent and your sync tasks from the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>. Jobs can specify the transfer of an entire file system or a specific directory tree, with the option to detect and skip files that are already present in the destination. File metadata (modification and access time, POSIX ownership and permissions, symbolic links, and hard links) is also copied.</p> 
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Using EFS File Sync</span></strong><br /> In order to write this blog post, I launched an EC2 instance, exported an NFS file system (<strong>/data</strong>), and populated the file system with the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux">Linux kernel source code</a>.</p> 
<p>I open the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/efs/home">EFS Console</a> in the same Region as my instance, and click <strong>File syncs</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_sync_splash_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I click on <strong>Get started</strong>, choose <strong>Amazon EC2</strong> as my host platform and click <strong>Launch instance</strong>, and click <strong>Connect to agent</strong> to proceed:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_sync_go_launch_2.png" /></p> 
<p>Clicking <strong>Launch instance</strong> opens the EC2 console in a separate tab. I pick a <strong>Memory optimized</strong> instance type (<strong>xlarge</strong> or bigger), configure it with a public IP address and with a security group that allows inbound traffic on port 80, and launch it as I would any other EC2 instance. Then I wait a minute or two (time to water my plants or check on my dog), and wait until the status checks pass:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_sync_instance_ready_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I capture the instance’s public IP address, return to the EFS tab, enter the address, and click on <strong>Activate agent</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_connect_to_agent_2.png" /></p> 
<p>This step retrieves the activation key from the sync agent. After it completes, I enter a name for it and click <strong>Activate agent</strong> to proceed:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_activate_agent_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Now that the agent is running and activated, I click on <strong>Create sync task</strong> to start moving some files to EFS:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_agents_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I configure the source location (the EC2 instance that I mentioned at the start of this section):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_config_source_nfs_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I also choose the destination EFS file system and specify a target location within it for my files:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_config_dest_2.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I select my sync options and click <strong>Next</strong> to review my configuration:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_config_sync_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The review looks good and I click <strong>Create sync task</strong> to start copying my files:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_review_2.png" /></p> 
<p>After the sync task has been created and its status becomes Available, I can select it and choose <strong>Start</strong> from the <strong>Actions</strong> menu to initiate a sync:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_start_agent_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I fine-tune the settings that I established when I created the task, and click <strong>Start</strong> to proceed:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_go_go_gadget_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I can track the status of the sync task on the <strong>History</strong> tab:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_syncing_1.png" /></p> 
<p>It completes within minutes and my EFS file system now includes the new files:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/efs_linux_synced_1.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> EFS File Sync is available in all AWS Regions where EFS is available. You pay for the EFS and EC2 resources that you consume and $0.01 per GB of data copied (see the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/efs/pricing/">EFS Pricing</a> page for more info).</p>

<p>The whole idea started about a year <span style="color: #808080">ago</span> during an casual conversation with Jeff when I first joined AWS. While <span style="color: #808080">we’re <span style="color: #000000">usually pretty good at staying focused in our meetings, he brought up that he had just finished a book he really enjoyed and asked me if I had read it. (A book that has since been made into a movie.) I don’t think there was a way for him to even </span>imagine<span style="color: #000000"> that as a huge fan of games, both table top and video games, how stoked I would be about the idea of bringing a game to our readers.<br /> </span></span></p> 
<p>We got to talking about how great it would be to <span style="color: #808080">attempt&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000">a game that would involve the <span style="color: #808080">entire</span>&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000">suite of AWS products and our various platforms. This idea might <span style="color: #808080">appear&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000">to be <span style="color: #808080">easy<span style="color: #000000">, but it has kept us <span style="color: #808080">busy&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000">with Lone Shark for about a year and we haven’t even scratched the surface of what we would like to do. Being able to <span style="color: #808080">finally</span> share this first game with our customers has been an absolute delight.<br /> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p> 
<p>From March 8-27th, each day we have been and will be releasing a new puzzle. The clues for the puzzles are hidden <span style="color: #808080">somewhere</span> all over AWS, and once customers have found the clues they can figure out the puzzle which results in a word. That word is the name of a component to rebuild Ozz, Jeff’s robot buddy.</p> 
<p><span style="color: #808080"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #808080"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #808080"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #808080"><span style="color: #000000">We wanted to try make sure that <span style="color: #808080">anyone</span> could play and we tried to <span style="color: #808080">surround <span style="color: #000000">each puzzle with interesting Easter eggs. So far, it seems to be working and we are seeing some really cool collaborative effort between customers to solve the puzzles. From tech talks to <span style="color: #808080">women</span> who code, posts both recent and well in the past, and to Twitter and podcasts, we wanted to <span style="color: #808080">hide</span> the puzzles in places our customers might not have had a chance to really explore before. <span style="color: #808080">Given</span> how much Jeff enjoyed doing a live Twitch stream so much I won’t be surprised when he tells me he wants to do a <span style="color: #808080">TV</span> show next.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-route-53-traffic-flow/">learnings</a> we have already gathered as we are just a little past halfway in the quest are mind boggling. We have learned that there will be a <span style="color: #808080">guy</span> who figures out how to build a chicken coop in 3D to solve a puzzle, or build a script to crawl a site looking for any <span style="color: #808080">reply <span style="color: #000000">to a blog post</span></span> that might be a clue. There were puzzles we completely expected people to get <span style="color: #808080">stuck&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000">on that they have solved in a <span style="color: #808080">snap</span>. They have really </span>kept<span style="color: #000000"> us on our toes, which isn’t a <span style="color: #808080">bad</span> thing. It really doesn’t <span style="color: #808080">hurt</span> that the players are incredibly adept at thinking outside the box, and we can’t wait to tell you how the puzzles were solved at the <span style="color: #808080">end</span>.<br /> </span></span></p> 
<p><span style="color: #808080"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #808080"><span style="color: #000000">We <span style="color: #808080">still</span> have a little under a week of puzzles to go, before you can all join Jeff and special guests on a live Twitch stream to reassemble Ozz 2.0! And you don’t have to <span style="color: #808080">hold<span style="color: #000000"> off for the next time we play, as there are still many puzzles to be solved and every player matters!

<p>Today we’re releasing a new machine learning feature in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-analytics/">Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics</a> for detecting “hotspots” in your streaming data. We launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-kinesis-analytics-process-streaming-data-in-real-time-with-sql/">Kinesis Data Analytics</a> in August of 2016 and we’ve continued to add features since. As you may already know, Kinesis Data Analytics is a fully managed real-time processing engine for streaming data that lets you write SQL queries to derive meaning from your data and output the results to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/">Kinesis Data Firehose</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/">Kinesis Data Streams</a>, or even an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> function. The new <code>HOTSPOTS</code> function adds to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/real-time-clickstream-anomaly-detection-with-amazon-kinesis-analytics/">existing machine learning capabilities</a> in Kinesis that allow customers to leverage unsupervised streaming based machine learning algorithms. Customers don’t need to be experts in data science or machine learning to take advantage of these capabilities.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d1.awsstatic.com/diagrams/product-page-diagrams/diagram-how-it-works-kinesis-data-analytics.6298bab19eaf33227cce667729cbba2a6ac8af18.png" /></p> 
<h3>Hotspots</h3> 
<p>The <code><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/sqlref/sqlrf-hotspots.html">HOTSPOTS</a></code> function is a new Kinesis Data Analytics SQL function you can use to idenitfy relatively dense regions in your data without having to explicity build and train complicated machine learning models. You can identify subsections of your data that need immediate attention and take action programatically by streaming the hotspots out to a Kinesis Data stream, to a Firehose delivery stream, or by invoking a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> function.</p> 
<p>There are a ton of really cool scenarios where this could make your operations easier. Imagine a ride-share program or autonomous vehicle fleet communicating spatiotemporal data about traffic jams and congestion, or a datacenter where a number of servers start to overheat indicating an HVAC issue. <code>HOTSPOTS</code> is not limited to spatiotemporal data and you could apply it across many problem domains.</p> 
<p>The function follows some simple syntax and accepts the <code>DOUBLE</code>, <code>INTEGER</code>, <code>FLOAT</code>, <code>TINYINT</code>, <code>SMALLINT</code>, <code>REAL</code>, and <code>BIGINT</code> data types.</p> 
<p>The <code>HOTSPOTS</code> function takes a cursor as input and returns a JSON string describing the hotspot. This will be easier to understand with an example.</p> 
<h3>Using Kinesis Data Analytics to Detect Hotspots</h3> 
<p>Let’s take a simple data set from <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml">NY Taxi and&nbsp;Limousine&nbsp;Commission</a> that tracks yellow cab pickup and dropoff locations.&nbsp;Most of this data is already on S3 and publicly accessible at s3://nyc-tlc/. We will create a small python script to load our Kinesis Data Stream with Taxi records which will feed our Kinesis Data Analytics. Finally we’ll output all of this to a Kinesis Data Firehose connected to an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/" title="">Amazon Elasticsearch Service</a> cluster for visualization with Kibana. I know from living in New York for 5 years that we’ll probably find a hotspot or two in this data.</p> 
<p>First, we’ll create an input&nbsp;Kinesis stream and start sending our NYC Taxi Ride data into it. I just&nbsp;wrote a quick python script to read from one of the CSV files and used boto3 to push the records into Kinesis. You can put the record in whatever way works for you.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<code class="lang-python">import csv
import json
import boto3
def chunkit(l, n):
&quot;&quot;&quot;Yield successive n-sized chunks from l.&quot;&quot;&quot;
for i in range(0, len(l), n):
yield l[i:i + n]
kinesis = boto3.client(&quot;kinesis&quot;)
with open(&quot;taxidata2.csv&quot;) as f:
reader = csv.DictReader(f)
records = chunkit([{&quot;PartitionKey&quot;: &quot;taxis&quot;, &quot;Data&quot;: json.dumps(row)} for row in reader], 500)
for chunk in records:
kinesis.put_records(StreamName=&quot;TaxiData&quot;, Records=chunk)</code> 
<p>Next, we’ll create the Kinesis&nbsp;Data&nbsp;Analytics application and add our input stream with our taxi data as the source.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/19/kinesis_5-1024x420.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/19/kinesis_4-1024x370.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/20/kinesis_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Next we’ll automatically detect the schema.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/20/kinesis_2-1-1024x736.png" /></p> 
<p>Now we’ll create a quick SQL Script to detect our hotspots and add that to the Real Time Analytics section of our application.</p> 
<code class="lang-sql">CREATE OR REPLACE STREAM &quot;DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM&quot; (
&quot;pickup_longitude&quot; DOUBLE,
&quot;pickup_latitude&quot; DOUBLE,
HOTSPOTS_RESULT VARCHAR(10000)
); 
CREATE OR REPLACE PUMP &quot;STREAM_PUMP&quot; AS INSERT INTO &quot;DESTINATION_SQL_STREAM&quot; 
SELECT &quot;pickup_longitude&quot;, &quot;pickup_latitude&quot;, &quot;HOTSPOTS_RESULT&quot; FROM
TABLE(HOTSPOTS(
CURSOR(SELECT STREAM * FROM &quot;SOURCE_SQL_STREAM_001&quot;),
1000,
0.013,
20
)
);
</code> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/20/kinesis_7-1-1024x721.png">documentation</a>. The <code>HOTSPOTS_RESULT</code> returns some useful JSON that would let us plot bounding boxes around our hotspots:<br /> <code></code></p> 
{
&quot;hotspots&quot;: [
{
&quot;density&quot;: &quot;elided&quot;,
&quot;minValues&quot;: [40.7915039, -74.0077401],
&quot;maxValues&quot;: [40.7915041, -74.0078001]
}
]
} 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When we have our desired results we can save the script and connect our application to our Amazon Elastic Search Service Firehose Delivery Stream. We can run an intermediate lambda function in the firehose to transform our record into a format more suitable for geographic work. Then we can update our mapping in Elasticsearch to index the hotspot objects as Geo-Shapes.</p> 
<p>Finally, we can connect to Kibana and visualize the results.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2018/03/20/Screen-Shot-2018-03-20-at-10.48.12-AM.png" /></p> 
<p>Looks like Manhattan is pretty busy!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> This feature is available now in all existing regions with Kinesis Data Analytics. I think this is a really interesting new feature of Kinesis Data Analytics that can bring immediate value to many applications. Let us know what you build with it on Twitter or in the comments!</p>

<p>As a follow-up to our earlier work to provide <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/heads-up-longer-ec2-ebs-resource-ids-coming-in-2016/">longer IDs</a> for a small set of essential EC2 resources, we are now doing the same for the remaining EC2 resources, with a migration deadline of July 2018. You can opt-in on a per-user, per-region, per-type basis and verify that your code, regular expressions, database schemas, and database queries work as expected</p> 
<p>If you have code that recognizes, processes, or stores IDs for any type of EC2 resources, please read this post with care! Here’s what you need to know:</p> 
<p><strong>Migration Deadline</strong> – You have until July 2018 to make sure that your code and your schemas can process and store the new, longer IDs. After that, longer IDs will be assigned by default for all newly created resources. IDs for existing resources will remain as-is and will continue to work.</p> 
<p><strong>More Resource Types</strong> – Longer IDs are now supported for all types of EC2 resources, and you can opt-in as desired:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ec2_longer_id_setup_opt_in_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I would like to encourage you to opt-in, starting with your test accounts, as soon as possible. This will give you time to thoroughly test your code and to make any necessary changes before promoting the code to production.</p> 
<p><strong>More Regions</strong> – The longer IDs are now available in the AWS <span title="">China (Beijing)</span> and AWS <span title="">China (Ningxia)</span> Regions.</p> 
<p><strong>Test AMIs</strong> – We have published AMIs with longer IDs that you can use for testing (search for <strong>testlongids</strong> to find them in the <strong>Public images</strong>):</p>

<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/ozz_2_0_4.jpg">AWS Quest</a> for quite some time and it has been great to see all of the progress made toward solving the puzzles in order to find the orangeprints that I will use to rebuild Ozz.</p> 
<p>The community effort has been impressive! There’s a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OFvY0kqA1Qkz8kQpcyoDlr_7jwyJGmGiTfGm7TOLUls/edit#gid=948135787">shared spreadsheet</a> with tabs for puzzles and clues, a busy Slack channel, and a <a href="http://awsquest-leaderboard.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/">leaderboard</a>, all organized and built by a team that spans the globe.</p> 
<p style="clear: both">I’ve been checking out the orangeprints as they are uncovered and have been doing a bit of planning and preparation to make sure that I am ready for the live-streamed rebuild on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/aws">Twitch</a> later this month. Yesterday I labeled a bunch of containers, one per puzzle, and stocked each one with the parts that I will use to rebuild the corresponding component of Ozz. Fortunately, I have at least (my last count may have skipped a few) 119,807 bricks and other parts at hand so this was easy. Here’s what I have set up so far:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/puzzle_11.jpg" /></p> 
<p>The Twitch session will take place on Tuesday, March 27 at Noon PT. In the meantime, you should check out the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/awsquest?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;src=refgoogle">#awsquest</a> tweets and see what you can do to help me to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/join-the-aws-quest-help-me-to-rebuild-ozz/">rebuild Ozz</a>.</p>
