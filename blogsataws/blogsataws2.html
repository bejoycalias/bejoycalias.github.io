<p>My colleague Sanjay Padhi shared the guest post below in order to recognize an important milestone in the use of EC2 Spot Instances.</p> 
<p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffbarr">Jeff</a>;</p> 
<hr /> 
<p>A group of researchers from <a href="http://www.clemson.edu/">Clemson University</a> achieved a remarkable milestone while studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model">topic modeling</a>, an important component of machine learning associated with natural language processing, breaking the record for creating the largest high-performance cluster in the cloud by using more than 1,100,000 vCPUs on Amazon EC2 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">Spot Instances</a> running in a single AWS region. The researchers conducted nearly half a million topic modeling experiments to study how human language is processed by computers. Topic modeling helps in discovering the underlying themes that are present across a collection of documents. Topic models are important because they are used to forecast business trends and help in making policy or funding decisions. These topic models can be run with many different parameters and the goal of the experiments is to explore how these parameters affect the model outputs.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>The Experiment</strong></span><br /> Professor <a href="https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~aapon/">Amy Apon</a>, Co-Director of the Complex Systems, Analytics and Visualization Institute at Clemson University with Professor <a href="http://alexherzog.net/">Alexander Herzog</a> and graduate students <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-posey-a4705571/">Brandon Posey</a> and Christopher Gropp in collaboration with members of the AWS team as well as AWS Partner <a href="http://www.omnibond.com/">Omnibond</a> performed the experiments. &nbsp;They used software infrastructure based on <a href="http://www.cloudycluster.com/">CloudyCluster</a> that provisions high performance computing clusters on dynamically allocated AWS resources using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ec2-spot-fleet-api-manage-thousands-of-instances-with-one-request/">Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet</a>. Spot Fleet is a collection of biddable spot instances in EC2 responsible for maintaining a target capacity specified during the request. The <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/">SLURM scheduler</a> was used as an overlay virtual workload manager for the data analytics workflows. The team developed additional provisioning and workflow automation software as shown below for the design and orchestration of the experiments. This setup allowed them to evaluate various topic models on different data sets with massively parallel parameter sweeps on dynamically allocated AWS resources. This framework can easily be used beyond the current study for other scientific applications that use parallel computing.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Ramping to 1.1 Million vCPUs</strong></span><br /> The figure below shows elastic, automatic expansion of resources as a function of time, in the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span> Region. At just after 21:40 (GMT-1) on Aug. 26, 2017, the number of vCPUs utilized was 1,119,196. Clemson researchers also took advantage of the new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-per-second-billing-for-ec2-instances-and-ebs-volumes/">per-second billing for the EC2 instances</a> that they launched. The vCPU count usage is comparable to the core count on the largest supercomputers in the world.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/clemson_util_2.png" width="900" height="512" /></p> 
<p>Here’s the breakdown of the EC2 instance types that they used:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/clemson_vcpu_dist_1.png" width="810" height="433" /></p> 
<p>Campus resources at Clemson funded by the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a> were used to determine an effective configuration for the AWS experiments as compared to campus resources, and the AWS cloud resources complement the campus resources for large-scale experiments.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Meet the Team</strong></span><br /> Here’s the team that ran the experiment (Professor Alexander Herzog, graduate students Christopher Gropp and Brandon Posey, and Professor Amy Apon):</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/clemson_team_1.png" width="710" height="399" /></p> 
<p>Professor Apon said about the experiment:</p> 
<p style="padding-left: 60px">I am absolutely thrilled with the outcome of this experiment. The graduate students on the project are amazing. They used resources from AWS and Omnibond and developed a new software infrastructure to perform research at a scale and time-to-completion not possible with only campus resources. Per-second billing was a key enabler of these experiments.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/boydwilson/">Boyd Wilson</a> (CEO, Omnibond, member of the AWS Partner Network) told me:</p> 
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Participating in this project was exciting, seeing how the Clemson team developed a provisioning and workflow automation tool that tied into CloudyCluster to build a huge Spot Fleet supercomputer in a single region in AWS was outstanding.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>About the Experiment</strong></span><br /> The experiments test parameter combinations on a range of topics and other parameters used in the topic model. The topic model outputs are stored in Amazon S3 and are currently being analyzed. The models have been applied to 17 years of computer science journal abstracts (533,560 documents and 32,551,540 words) and full text papers from the <a href="https://nips.cc/">NIPS</a> (Neural Information Processing Systems) Conference (2,484 documents and 3,280,697 words). This study allows the research team to systematically measure and analyze the impact of parameters and model selection on model convergence, topic composition and quality.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Looking Forward</strong></span><br /> This study constitutes an interaction between computer science, artificial intelligence, and high performance computing. Papers describing the full study are being submitted for peer-reviewed publication. I hope that you enjoyed this brief insight into the ways in which AWS is helping to break the boundaries in the frontiers of natural language processing!</p>

<p>Last week <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/" title="">Amazon Pinpoint</a> launched AWS Global SMS two-way text messaging and we didn’t get an opportunity to cover the launch. AWS Pinpoint users can now programmaticaly respond to their end-users’ text messages. Users can provision both short codes and long codes (10-digit phone numbers) which send inbound messages to an SNS topic. Let’s take a look.</p> 
<p>First I’ll navigate to the Pinpoint console where I’ll use the “Create a project in Mobile Hub” button in the top right corner. I’ll follow the steps in the wizard until the project is created.</p> 
<p><img style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/09/18/Screenshot-2017-09-17-20.26.21.png" alt="" width="1024" height="479" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20927" /></p> 
<p><img style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/09/18/2017-09-17-20.26.45.gif" alt="" width="748" height="856" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20928" /></p> 
<p>Next, in the Pinpoint console I’ll click “Account Settings” in the top-right of the console window.</p> 
<p><img style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/09/18/Screenshot-2017-09-17-20.32.25.png" alt="" width="1024" height="651" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20929" /></p> 
<p>At the bottom of the Account Settings page there is a “Number Settings” section. If you don’t already have any short codes or long codes provisioned you’ll have to open a support ticket to request one. It can take multiple weeks for a short code to be approved by all carriers. Long codes are typically easier to provision.</p> 
<p><img style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/09/18/Screenshot-2017-09-17-20.33.31.png" alt="" width="1024" height="477" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20930" /></p> 
<p>Since I already have a few numbers provisioned I’ll use one of them now by clicking on it which brings me to that number’s configuration page.</p> 
<p><img style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/09/18/Screenshot-2017-09-17-20.48.44.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1015" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20931" /></p> 
<p>Here I’ll enable 2-way SMS and create an SNS topic for messages.</p> 
<p>I could create a quick lambda function to trigger on the SNS topic messages and then respond again with pinpoint.</p> 
<pre class="lang-python"><code>
import boto3
pinpoint = boto3.client('pinpoint')
def lambda_handler(event, context):
pinpoint.send_messages(
ApplicationId='557d87b57bdb499f8b5eef575435d3b8',
MessageRequest={
'Addresses': {
event['Records'][0]['Sns']['originationNumber']: {'ChannelType': 'SMS'}
},
'MessageConfiguration': {
'SMSMessage': {
'Body': 'Vim is the best!',
'MessageType': 'TRANSACTIONAL'
}
}
}
)
</code></pre> 
<p>But pinpoint is extremely full-featured and you’re not limited to this simple message type. You can define rich <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/campaigns-message.html">messaging campaigns</a> with various substitutions based on stored user data.</p> 
<p>SMS is an area of continued investment for AWS so you can expect to see more advances and improvements as customers give us feedback on these new features. Let us know if you build anything cool with this!</p>

<p>Last year we launched new AWS Regions in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-canada-central-region/">Canada</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-asia-pacific-mumbai-region/">India</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-asia-pacific-seoul-region/">Korea</a>, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-london-region/">UK</a>, and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-us-east-ohio-region/">United States</a>, and announced that new regions are coming to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">China</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/coming-in-2017-new-aws-region-in-france/">France</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-region-in-hong-kong/">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/coming-in-2018-new-aws-region-in-sweden/">Sweden</a>, and a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-govcloud-us-heads-east-new-region-in-the-works-for-2018/">second GovCloud Region</a> in the US throughout 2017 and 2018.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Middle East Region by Early 2019</strong></span><br /> Today, I am happy to announce that we will be opening an AWS Region in the Middle East by early 2019. The new Region will be based in Bahrain, will be comprised of three Availability Zones at launch, and will give AWS customers and partners the ability to run their workloads and store their data in the Middle East.</p> 
<p>AWS customers are already making use of 44 Availability Zones across 16 geographic regions. Today’s announcement brings the total number of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">global regions</a> (operational and in the works) up to 22.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>UAE Edge Location in 2018</strong></span><br /> We also plan to open an edge location in the UAE in the first quarter of 2018. This will bring <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" title="">Amazon CloudFront</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/" title="">Amazon Route 53</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/shield/" title="">AWS Shield</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/waf" title="">AWS WAF</a> to the region, adding to our existing set of 84 points of presence world-wide.</p> 
<p>These announcements add to our continued investment in the Middle East. Earlier this year we announced the opening of AWS offices in Dubai, UAE and Manama, Bahrain. Prior to this we have supported the growth of technology education in the region with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/">AWS Educate</a> and have supported the growth of new businesses through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/activate/">AWS Activate</a> for many years.</p> 
<p>The addition of AWS infrastructure in the Middle East will help countries across the region to innovate, grow their economies, and pursue their vision plans (<a href="http://vision2030.gov.sa/en">Saudi Vision 2030</a>, <a href="https://www.vision2021.ae/en">UAE Vision 2021</a>, <a href="http://bahrainedb.com/about-us/economic-vision-2030/">Bahrain Vision 2030</a>, and so forth).</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Talk to Us</strong></span><br /> As always, we are looking forward to serving new and existing customers in the Middle East and working with partners across the region. Of course, the new Region will also be open to existing AWS customers who would like to serve users in the Middle East.</p> 
<p>To learn more about the AWS Middle East Region feel free to contact our team at <a href="mailto:aws-me@amazon.com">aws-me@amazon.com</a> .</p> 
<p>If you are interested in joining the team and would like to learn more about AWS positions in the Middle East, take a look at the <a href="http://amazon.jobs/">Amazon Jobs</a> site.</p>

<p>As I have noted in the past, the AWS Blog Team is working hard to make sure that you know about as many AWS launches and publications as possible, without totally burying you in content! As part of our balancing act, we will occasionally publish catch-up posts to clear our queues and to bring more information to your attention. Here’s what I have in store for you today:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Monitoring for Cross-Region Replication of S3 Objects</li> 
<li>Tags for Spot Fleet Instances</li> 
<li>PCI DSS Compliance for 12 More Services</li> 
<li>HIPAA Eligibility for WorkDocs</li> 
<li>VPC Resizing</li> 
<li>AppStream 2.0 Graphics Design Instances</li> 
<li>AMS Connector App for ServiceNow</li> 
<li>Regtech in the Cloud</li> 
<li>New &amp; Revised Quick Starts</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Let’s jump right in!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Monitoring for Cross-Region Replication of S3 Objects</strong></span><br /> I told you about <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-cross-region-replication-for-amazon-s3/">cross-region replication for S3</a> a couple of years ago. As I showed you at the time, you simply enable versioning for the source bucket and then choose a destination region and bucket. You can check the replication status manually, or you can create an inventory (daily or weekly) of the source and destination buckets.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/infrastructure-management/crr-monitor/">Cross-Region Replication Monitor</a> (CRR Monitor for short) solution checks the replication status of objects across regions and gives you metrics and failure notifications in near real-time.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/crr_monitor_overview_1.png" width="743" height="461" /></p> 
<p>To learn more, read the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/crr-monitor/welcome.html">CRR Monitor Implementation Guide</a> and then use the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" title="">AWS CloudFormation</a> template to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/crr-monitor/deployment.html">Deploy the CRR Monitor</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Tags for Spot Instances</strong></span><br /> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">Spot Instances</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet.html">Spot Fleets</a> (collections of Spot Instances) give you access to spare compute capacity. We recently gave you the ability to enter tags (key/value pairs) as part of your spot requests and to have those tags applied to the EC2 instances launched to fulfill the request:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/tag_spot_instances_1.png" width="754" height="209" /></p> 
<p>To learn more, read <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/07/tag-your-spot-fleet-ec2-instances/">Tag Your Spot Fleet EC2 Instances</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>PCI DSS Compliance for 12 More Services</strong></span><br /> As first announced on the AWS Security Blog, we recently <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-adds-12-more-services-to-its-pci-dss-compliance-program/">added 12 more services</a> to our PCI DSS compliance program, raising the total number of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/">in-scope services</a> to 42. To learn more, check out our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/resources/">Compliance Resources</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>HIPAA Eligibility for WorkDocs</strong></span><br /> In other compliance news, we announced that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/07/amazon-workdocs-achieves-hipaa-eligibility-and-pci-dss-compliance/">Amazon WorkDocs has achieved HIPAA eligibility and PCI DSS compliance</a> in all AWS Regions where WorkDocs is available.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>VPC Resizing</strong></span><br /> This feature allows you to extend an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) by adding additional blocks of addresses. This gives you more flexibility and should help you to deal with growth. You can add up to four secondary /16 CIDRs per VPC. You can also edit the secondary CIDRs by deleting them and adding new ones. Simply select the VPC and choose <strong>Edit CIDRs</strong> from the menu:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/vpc_edit_cidrs_1.png" width="538" height="344" /></p> 
<p>Then add or remove CIDR blocks as desired:</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AMS Connector App for ServiceNow</strong></span><br /> AWS Managed Services (AMS) provides <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/category/aws-managed-services/">Infrastructure Operations Management for the Enterprise</a>. Designed to accelerate cloud adoption, it automates common operations such as change requests, patch management, security and backup.</p>

<p><img style="float: right;padding-left: 8px;padding-bottom: 8px" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/req_spot_inst_button_v1.png" /><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">EC2 Spot Instances</a> give you access to spare EC2 compute capacity at up to 90% off of the On-Demand rates. Starting with the ability to request a specific number of instances of a particular size, we made Spot Instances even more useful and flexible with support for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ec2-spot-fleet-api-manage-thousands-of-instances-with-one-request/">Spot Fleets</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-auto-scaling-for-ec2-spot-fleets/">Auto Scaling Spot Fleets</a>, allowing you to maintain any desired level of compute capacity.</p> 
<p>EC2 users have long had the ability to stop running instances while leaving EBS volumes attached, opening the door to applications that automatically pick up where they left off when the instance starts running again.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Stop and Resume Spot Workloads</strong></span><br /> Today we are blending these two important features, allowing you to set up Spot bids and Spot Fleets that respond by stopping (rather than terminating) instances when capacity is no longer available at or below your bid price. EBS volumes attached to stopped instances remain intact, as does the EBS-backed root volume. When capacity becomes available, the instances are started and can keep on going without having to spend time provisioning applications, setting up EBS volumes, downloading data, joining network domains, and so forth.</p> 
<p>Many AWS customers have enhanced their applications to create and make use of checkpoints, adding some resilience and gaining the ability to take advantage of EC2’s start/stop feature in the process. These customers will now be able to run these applications on Spot Instances, with savings that average 70-90%.</p> 
<p>While the instances are stopped, you can modify the EBS Optimization, User data, Ramdisk ID, and Delete on Termination attributes. Stopped Spot Instances do not incur any charges for compute time; space for attached EBS volumes is charged at the usual rates.</p> 
<p>Here’s how you create a Spot bid or Spot Fleet and specify the use of stop/start:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/spot_set_stop_1.png" width="793" height="570" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Things to Know<br /> </strong></span>This feature is available now and you can start using it today in all AWS Regions where Spot Instances are available. It is designed to work well in conjunction with the new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-per-second-billing-for-ec2-instances-and-ebs-volumes/">per-second billing for EC2 instances and EBS volumes</a>, with the potential for another dimension of cost savings over and above that provided by Spot Instances.</p> 
<p>EBS volumes always exist within a particular Availability Zone (AZ). As a result, Spot and Spot Fleet requests that specify a particular AZ will always restart in that AZ.</p> 
<p>Take care when using this feature in conjunction with Spot Fleets that have the potential to span a wide variety of instance types. Because the composition of the fleet can change over time, you need to pay attention to your account’s limits for IP addresses and EBS volumes.</p> 
<p>I’m looking forward to hearing about the new and creative uses that you’ll come up with for this feature. If you thought that your application was not a good fit for Spot Instances, or if the overhead needed to handle interruptions was too high, it is time to take another look!</p>

<p>Back in the old days, you needed to buy or lease a server if you needed access to compute power. When we <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon_ec2_beta/">launched EC2</a> back in 2006, the ability to use an instance for an hour, and to pay only for that hour, was big news. The pay-as-you-go model inspired our customers to think about new ways to develop, test, and run applications of all types.</p> 
<p>Today, services like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> prove that we can do a lot of useful work in a short time. Many of our customers are dreaming up applications for EC2 that can make good use of a large number of instances for shorter amounts of time, sometimes just a few minutes.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Per-Second Billing for EC2 and EBS</strong></span><br /> Effective October 2nd, usage of Linux instances that are launched in On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot form will be billed in one-second increments. Similarly, provisioned storage for EBS volumes will be billed in one-second increments.</p> 
<p>Per-second billing also applies to several other AWS services:</p> 
<p><strong>Amazon EMR</strong> – Our customers add capacity to their EMR clusters in order to get their results more quickly. With per-second billing for the EC2 instances in the clusters, adding nodes is more cost-effective than ever. To learn more, read <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/10/amazon-emr-now-supports-per-second-billing/">Amazon EMR Now Supports Per-Second Billing</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>AWS Batch</strong> – Many of the batch jobs that our customers run complete in less than an hour. AWS Batch already launches and terminates Spot Instances; with per-second billing for the EC2 instances, batch processing will become even more economical.</p> 
<p><strong>Elastic GPUs</strong> – Usage of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-work-amazon-ec2-elastic-gpus/">Elastic GPUs</a> is billed by the second, with a 1 minute minimum.</p> 
<p><strong>Provisioned IOPS</strong> – <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/fast-forward-provisioned-iops-ebs/">Provisioned IOPS</a> for <strong>io1</strong> EBS volumes is billed by the second.</p> 
<p>Some of our more sophisticated customers have built systems to get the most value from EC2 by strategically choosing the most advantageous target instances when managing their gaming, ad tech, or 3D rendering fleets. Per-second billing obviates the need for this extra layer of instance management, and brings the costs savings to all customers and all workloads.</p> 
<p>While this will result in a price reduction for many workloads (and you know we love <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/category/price-reduction/">price reductions</a>), I don’t think that’s the most important aspect of this change. I believe that this change will inspire you to innovate and to think about your compute-bound problems in new ways. How can you use it to improve your support for continuous integration? Can it change the way that you provision transient environments for your dev and test workloads? What about your analytics, batch processing, and 3D rendering?</p> 
<p>One of the many advantages of cloud computing is the elastic nature of provisioning or deprovisioning resources as you need them. By billing usage down to the second we will enable customers to level up their elasticity, save money, and customers will be positioned to take advantage of continuing advances in computing.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Things to Know</strong></span><br /> This change is effective in all AWS Regions and will be effective October 2, for all Linux instances that are newly launched or already running. There is a 1 minute minimum charge per-instance.</p> 
<p>Per-second billing is not currently applicable to instances running Microsoft Windows or Linux distributions that have a separate hourly charge. Marketplace AMIs that do not have a separate hourly charge are eligible for per-second billing.</p> 
<p>List prices and Spot Market prices are still listed on a per-hour basis, but bills are calculated down to the second, as is Reserved Instance usage (you can launch, use, and terminate multiple instances within an hour and get the Reserved Instance Benefit for all of the instances). Also, bills will show times in decimal form, like this:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/psb_bill_example_1.png" width="892" height="255" /></p> 
<p>The Dedicated Per Region Fee, EBS Snapshots, and products in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/" title="">AWS Marketplace</a> are still billed on an hourly basis.</p>

<p>The third annual <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=13887280011">Prime Day</a> set another round of records for global orders, topping Black Friday and Cyber Monday, making it the biggest day in Amazon retail history. Over the course of the 30 hour event, tens of millions of Prime members purchased things like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015TJD0Y4">Echo Dots</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-Tablet-Family/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=6669703011">Fire tablets</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01B1VC13K">programmable pressure cookers</a>, espresso machines, rechargeable batteries, and much more! July 11th also set a record for the number of new Prime memberships, as people signed up in order to take advantage of hundreds of thousands of deals. Amazon customers shopped online and made heavy use of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000625601">Amazon App</a>, with mobile orders more than doubling from last Prime Day.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Powered by AWS</strong></span><br /> Last year I told you about <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/how-aws-powered-amazons-biggest-day-ever/">How AWS Powered Amazon’s Biggest Day Ever</a>, and shared what the team had learned with regard to preparation, automation, monitoring, and thinking big. All of those lessons still apply and you can read that post to learn more. Preparation for this year’s Prime Day (which started just days after Prime Day 2016 wrapped up) started by collecting and sharing best practices and identifying areas for improvement, proceeding to implementation and stress testing as the big day approached. Two of the best practices involve auditing and GameDay:</p> 
<p><strong>Auditing</strong> – This is a formal way for us to track preparations, identify risks, and to track progress against our objectives. Each team must respond to a series of detailed technical and operational questions that are designed to help them determine their readiness. On the technical side, questions could revolve around time to recovery after a database failure, including the all-important check of the TTL (time to live) for the CNAME. Operational questions address schedules for on-call personnel, points of contact, and ownership of services &amp; instances.</p> 
<p><strong>GameDay</strong> – This practice (which I believe originated with former Amazonian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Robbins">Jesse Robbins</a>), is intended to validate all of the capacity planning &amp; preparation and to verify that all of the necessary operational practices are in place and work as expected. It introduces simulated failures and helps to train the team to identify and quickly resolve issues, building muscle memory in the process. It also tests failover and recovery capabilities, and can expose latent defects that are lurking under the covers. GameDays help teams to understand scaling drivers (page views, orders, and so forth) and gives them an opportunity to test their scaling practices. To learn more, read <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2371297">Resilience Engineering: Learning to Embrace Failure</a> or watch the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoz0ZjfrQ9s">GameDay: Creating Resiliency Through Destruction</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Prime Day 2017 Metrics</strong></span><br /> So, how did we do this year?</p> 
<p>The AWS teams checked their dashboards and log files, and were happy to share their metrics with me. Here are a few of the most interesting ones:</p> 
<p><strong>Block Storage </strong>– Use of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/" title="">Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)</a> grew by 40% year-over-year, with aggregate data transfer jumping to 52 petabytes (a 50% increase) for the day and total I/O requests rising to 835 million (a 30% increase). The team told me that they loved the elasticity of EBS, and that they were able to ramp down on capacity after Prime Day concluded instead of being stuck with it.</p> 
<p><strong>NoSQL Database – </strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" title="">Amazon DynamoDB</a> requests from Alexa, the Amazon.com sites, and the Amazon fulfillment centers totaled 3.34 trillion, peaking at 12.9 million per second. According to the team, the extreme scale, consistent performance, and high availability of DynamoDB let them meet needs of Prime Day without breaking a sweat<strong>.</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Stack Creation</strong> – Nearly 31,000 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" title="">AWS CloudFormation</a> stacks were created for Prime Day in order to bring additional AWS resources on line.</p> 
<p><strong>API Usage – </strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/" title="">AWS CloudTrail</a> processed over 50 billion events and tracked more than 419 billion calls to various AWS APIs, all in support of Prime Day.</p> 
<p><strong>Configuration Tracking</strong> – <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/config/" title="">AWS Config</a> generated over 14 million Configuration items for AWS resources.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>You Can Do It</strong></span><br /> Running an event that is as large, complex, and mission-critical as Prime Day takes a lot of planning. If you have an event of this type in mind, please take a look at our new <a href="https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-infrastructure-event-readiness.pdf">Infrastructure Event Readiness</a> white paper. Inside, you will learn how to design and provision your applications to smoothly handle planned scaling events such as product launches or seasonal traffic spikes, with sections on automation, resiliency, cost optimization, event management, and more.</p>

<p>Earlier this year I told you about <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-in-memory-processing-update-instances-with-4-to-16-tb-of-memory-scale-out-sap-hana-to-34-tb/">our plan</a> to launch EC2 instances with up to 16 TB of memory. Today I am happy to announce that the new <strong>x1e.32xlarge</strong> instances with 4 TB of DDR4 memory are available in four AWS Regions. As I wrote in my earlier post, these instances are designed to run SAP HANA and other memory intensive, in-memory applications. Many of our customers are already running production SAP applications on the existing <strong>x1.32xlarge</strong> instances. With today’s launch, these customers can now store and process far larger data sets, making them a great fit for larger production deployments.</p> 
<p>Like the <strong>x1.32xlarge</strong>, the <strong>x1e.32xlarge</strong> is powered by quad socket Intel Xeon E7 8880 v3 Haswell processors running at 2.3GHz (128 vCPUs), with large L3 caches, plenty of memory bandwidth, and support for C-state and P-state management.</p> 
<p>On the network side, the instances offer up to 25 Gbps of network bandwidth when launched within an EC2 placement group, powered by the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/elastic-network-adapter-high-performance-network-interface-for-amazon-ec2/">Elastic Network Adapter</a> (ENA), with support for up to 8 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-elastic-network-interfaces-in-the-virtual-private-cloud/">Elastic Network Interfaces</a> (ENIs) per instance. The instances are EBS-optimized by default, with an additional 14 Gbps of dedicated bandwidth to your EBS volumes, and support for up to 80,000 IOPS per instance. Each instance also includes a pair of 1,920 GB SSD volumes.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>A Few Notes</strong></span><br /> Here are a couple of things to keep in mind regarding the <strong>x1e.32xlarge</strong>:</p> 
<p><strong>SAP Certification</strong> – The <strong>x1e.32xlarge</strong> instances are our largest cloud-native instances certified and supported by SAP for&nbsp;production HANA deployments of SAP Business Suite on HANA (SoH), SAP Business Warehouse on HANA (BWoH), and the next-generation SAP S/4HANA ERP and SAP BW/4HANA data warehouse solution. If you are already running SAP HANA workloads on smaller X1 instances, scaling up will be quick and easy. The <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstart/latest/sap-hana/welcome.html">SAP HANA on the AWS Cloud Quick Start Reference Deployment</a> has been updated and will help you to set up a deployment that follows SAP and AWS standards for high performance and reliability. The <a href="https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/iaas.html#categories=Amazon%20Web%20Services">SAP HANA Hardware Directory</a> and the <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/benchmark/sizing.html">SAP HANA Sizing Guidelines</a> are also relevant.</p> 
<p><strong>Reserved Instances</strong> – The regional size flexibility for Reserved Instances does not apply across <strong>x1</strong> and <strong>x1e</strong>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Now Available</strong></span><br /> The <strong>x1e.32xlarge</strong> instances can be launched in On-Demand and Reserved Instance form via the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/" title="">AWS SDKs</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/" title="">AWS Marketplace</a> in the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span>, and <span title="">Asia Pacific (Tokyo)</span> Regions.</p> 
<p>I would also like to make you aware of a couple of other upgrades to the X1 instances:</p> 
<p><strong>EBS</strong> – As part of today’s launch, existing X1 instances also support up to 14 Gbps of dedicated bandwidth to EBS, along with 80,000 IOPS per instance.</p> 
<p><strong>Network</strong> – Earlier this week, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/09/announcing-improved-networking-performance-for-amazon-ec2-instances/">we announced</a> that existing <strong>x1.32xlarge</strong> instances also support up to 25 Gbps of network bandwidth within placement groups.</p>

<p><img style="float: right;padding-left: 8px;padding-bottom: 8px" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/nlb_con_menu_1.png" /><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing" title="">Elastic Load Balancing</a> (ELB) has been an important part of AWS since 2009, when it was <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-load-balancing-automatic-scaling-and-cloud-monitoring-services/">launched</a> as part of a three-pack that also included <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling" title="">Auto Scaling</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" title="">Amazon CloudWatch</a>. Since that time we have added many features, and also introduced the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-application-load-balancer/">Application Load Balancer</a>. Designed to support application-level, content-based routing to applications that run in containers, Application Load Balancers pair well with microservices, streaming, and real-time workloads.</p> 
<p>Over the years, our customers have used ELB to support web sites and applications that run at almost any scale — from simple sites running on a T2 instance or two, all the way up to complex applications that run on large fleets of higher-end instances and handle massive amounts of traffic. Behind the scenes, ELB monitors traffic and automatically scales to meet demand. This process, which includes a generous buffer of headroom, has become quicker and more responsive over the years and works well even for our customers who use ELB to support live broadcasts, “flash” sales, and holidays. However, in some situations such as instantaneous fail-over between regions, or extremely spiky workloads, we have worked with our customers to pre-provision ELBs in anticipation of a traffic surge.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Network Load Balancer</strong></span><br /> Today we are introducing the new Network Load Balancer (NLB). It is designed to handle tens of millions of requests per second while maintaining high throughput at ultra low latency, with no effort on your part. The Network Load Balancer is API-compatible with the Application Load Balancer, including full programmatic control of Target Groups and Targets. Here are some of the most important features:</p> 
<p><strong>Static IP Addresses</strong> – Each Network Load Balancer provides a single IP address for each Availability Zone in its purview. If you have targets in <strong>us-west-2a</strong> and other targets in <strong>us-west-2c</strong>, NLB will create and manage two IP addresses (one per AZ); connections to that IP address will spread traffic across the instances in all the VPC subnets in the AZ. You can also specify an existing Elastic IP for each AZ for even greater control. With full control over your IP addresses, Network Load Balancer can be used in situations where IP addresses need to be hard-coded into DNS records, customer firewall rules, and so forth.</p> 
<p><strong>Zonality – </strong>The IP-per-AZ feature reduces latency with improved performance, improves availability through isolation and fault tolerance and makes the use of Network Load Balancers transparent to your client applications. Network Load Balancers also attempt to route a series of requests from a particular source to targets in a single AZ while still providing automatic failover should those targets become unavailable.</p> 
<p><strong>Source Address Preservation</strong> – With Network Load Balancer, the original source IP address and source ports for the incoming connections remain unmodified, so application software need not support <strong>X-Forwarded-For, </strong>proxy protocol<strong>,</strong> or other workarounds. This also means that normal firewall rules, including VPC Security Groups, can be used on targets.</p> 
<p><strong>Long-running Connections</strong> – NLB handles connections with built-in fault tolerance, and can handle connections that are open for months or years, making them a great fit for IoT, gaming, and messaging applications.</p> 
<p><strong>Failover</strong> – Powered by <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover.html">Route 53 health checks</a>, NLB supports failover between IP addresses within and across regions.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Creating a Network Load Balancer</strong></span><br /> I can create a Network Load Balancer opening up the EC2 Console, selecting <strong>Load Balancers</strong>, and clicking on <strong>Create Load Balancer</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/nlb_choose_type_2.png" /></p> 
<p>I choose Network Load Balancer and click on <strong>Create,</strong> then enter the details. I can choose an Elastic IP address for each subnet in the target VPC and I can tag the Network Load Balancer:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/nlb_config_step1_1.png" width="900" height="874" /></p> 
<p>Then I click on <strong>Configure Routing</strong> and create a new target group. I enter a name, and then choose the protocol and port. I can also set up health checks that go to the traffic port or to the alternate of my choice:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/nlb_config_step2_targeting_2.png" width="900" height="528" /></p> 
<p>Then I click on <strong>Register Targets</strong> and the EC2 instances that will receive traffic, and click on <strong>Add to registered</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/nlb_config_step3_pick_targets_1.png" width="900" height="690" /></p> 
<p>I make sure that everything looks good and then click on <strong>Create</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/nlb_config_review_1.png" width="896" height="517" /></p> 
<p>The state of my new Load Balancer is <strong>provisioning</strong>, switching to <strong>active</strong> within a minute or so:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/nlb_lbs_configuring_1.png" width="598" height="260" /></p> 
<p>For testing purposes, I simply grab the DNS name of the Load Balancer from the console (in practice I would use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/" title="">Amazon Route 53</a> and a more friendly name):</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/nlb_lb_dns_1.png" width="827" height="402" /></p> 
<p>Then I sent it a ton of traffic (I intended to let it run for just a second or two but got distracted and it created a huge number of processes, so this was a happy accident):</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ while true;
&gt; do
&gt;   wget http://nlb-1-6386cc6bf24701af.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/phpinfo2.php &amp;
&gt; done
</code></pre> 
<p>A more disciplined test would use a tool like <a href="https://github.com/newsapps/beeswithmachineguns">Bees with Machine Guns</a>, of course!</p> 
<p>I took a quick break to let some traffic flow and then checked the CloudWatch metrics for my Load Balancer, finding that it was able to handle the sudden onslaught of traffic with ease:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/nlb_metrics_1.png" width="900" height="748" /></p> 
<p>I also looked at my EC2 instances to see how they were faring under the load (really well, it turns out):</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/nlb_ec2_fine_2.png" width="887" height="573" /></p> 
<p>It turns out that my colleagues did run a more disciplined test than I did. They set up a Network Load Balancer and backed it with an Auto Scaled fleet of EC2 instances. They set up a second fleet composed of hundreds of EC2 instances, each running Bees with Machine Guns and configured to generate traffic with highly variable request and response sizes. Beginning at 1.5 million requests per second, they quickly turned the dial all the way up, reaching over 3 million requests per second and 30 Gbps of aggregate bandwidth before maxing out their test resources.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Choosing a Load Balancer</strong></span><br /> As always, you should consider the needs of your application when you choose a load balancer. Here are some guidelines:</p> 
<p><strong>Network Load Balancer (NLB) – I</strong>deal for load balancing of TCP traffic, NLB is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies. NLB is optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns while using a single static IP address per Availability Zone.</p> 
<p><strong>Application Load Balancer (ALB)</strong> – Ideal for advanced load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic, ALB provides advanced request routing that supports modern application architectures, including microservices and container-based applications.</p> 
<p><strong>Classic Load Balancer (CLB)</strong> – Ideal for applications that were built within the EC2-Classic network.</p> 
<p>For a side-by-side feature comparison, see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/details/#compare">Elastic Load Balancer Details</a> table.</p> 
<p>If you are currently using a Classic Load Balancer and would like to migrate to a Network Load Balancer, take a look at our new <a href="https://github.com/aws/elastic-load-balancing-tools">Load Balancer Copy Utility</a>. This Python tool will help you to create a Network Load Balancer with the same configuration as an existing Classic Load Balancer. It can also register your existing EC2 instances with the new load balancer.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Pricing &amp; Availability</strong></span><br /> Like the Application Load Balancer, pricing is based on Load Balancer Capacity Units, or LCUs. Billing is $0.006 per LCU, based on the highest value seen across the following dimensions:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Bandwidth</strong> – 1 GB per LCU.</li> 
<li><strong>New Connections</strong> – 800 per LCU.</li> 
<li><strong>Active Connections</strong> – 100,000 per LCU.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Most applications are bandwidth-bound and should see a cost reduction (for load balancing) of about 25% when compared to Application or Classic Load Balancers.</p> 
<p>Network Load Balancers are available today in all AWS commercial regions except <span title="">China (Beijing)</span>, supported by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" title="">AWS CloudFormation</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling" title="">Auto Scaling</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" title="">Amazon ECS</a>.</p>
