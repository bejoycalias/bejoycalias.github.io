<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/" title="">Serverless</a> applications have become mainstream more quickly than I ever could have imagined. Every second of every day, countless <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> functions spring to life on an as-needed basis, take care of some critical business function, and then finish up. Our users tell us that they love the flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of this model.</p> 
<p>We want to make sure that every AWS customer moves ahead into the serverless future. After the launch of Lambda, we followed up with the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model">Serverless Application Model</a> (SAM) to further simplify the process of deploying and managing serverless applications on AWS. We have also published serverless reference architectures for <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-webapp">web apps</a>, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-mobilebackend">mobile backends</a>, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-imagerecognition">image recognition &amp; processing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-fileprocessing">real-time file processing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-iotbackend">IoT</a>, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-mapreduce">MapReduce</a>, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-streamprocessing">real-time stream processing</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-imagemoderationchatbot">image moderation for chatbots</a>.</p> 
<p>Today I would like to tell you about the next step forward. We want to make it as easy as possible for AWS customers to discover and deploy serverless apps. We also want to strengthen the open source community around Lambda, SAM, and serverless apps, with room for everyone to share, participate, and benefit.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS Serverless Application Repository</strong></span><br /> <img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/sar_box_1.png">AWS Serverless Application Repository</a>. Designed for producers and consumers of serverless apps, this AWS Console component supports publishing, discovery, and deployment.</p> 
<p>Producers (developers, ISVs, SaaS providers, and AWS partners) can easily publish to the repository. Apps must be in SAM format, accompanied by a <a href="https://spdx.org/">SPDX</a> license identifier, with options to share globally (for all AWS customers) or privately (with access controls for individuals and teams). Source code and other application components can be stored in <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or another source code repository, and then included via reference; again with control over sharing.</p> 
<p>We’re looking forward to your submission. It will join others in progress from Datadog, Here, Splunk, and SignalFx.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>For Publishers</strong></span><br /> If you are already using SAM to build serverless apps, we’re just about ready to start accepting contributions. As a quick refresher, SAM lets you define <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/apigateway" title="">Amazon API Gateway</a> APIs, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" title="">Amazon DynamoDB</a> tables, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> functions that are triggered by API actions and uploads to S3. Your serverless app can use third-party libraries as long as they are available under an open source license that has been approved by the <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> (OSI). You will be able to use resource-based IAM policies to control access to your app—you can keep it private, grant cross-account access on an extremely selective basis, or make it available publicly.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>For Consumers</strong></span><br /> You will be able to find and start using the apps from the Lambda console:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/sar_find_app_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You will also be able to check on the status of each app:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/sar_app_status_1.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Stay Tuned</strong></span><br /> All of this functionality will be accessible from the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>, and a rich set of APIs. I’ll be sharing more info as it becomes available.</p> 
<p>If you are ready to get started, you can <a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/serverlessrepo-preview.html">sign up for the Preview</a>!</p>

<p>One of the first things you learn when you start programming is that, just like any craftsperson, your tools matter. Notepad.exe isn’t going to cut it. A powerful editor and testing pipeline supercharge your productivity. I still remember learning to use Vim for the first time and being able to zip around systems and complex programs. Do you remember how hard it was to setup all your compilers and dependencies on a new machine? How many cycles have you wasted matching versions, tinkering with configs, and then writing documentation to onboard a new developer to a project?</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/24/cloud9_console-1.png" /></p> 
<p>Today we’re launching <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">AWS Cloud9</a>, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing, running, and debugging code, all from your web browser. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for many popular programming languages (Javascript, Python, PHP, etc.) so you don’t have to tinker with installing various compilers and toolchains. Cloud9 also provides a seamless experience for working with serverless applications allowing you to quickly switch between local and remote testing or debugging. Based on the popular open source <a href="https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace">Ace Editor</a> and c9.io IDE (which we acquired last year), AWS Cloud9 is designed to make collaborative cloud development easy with extremely powerful pair programming features. There are more features than I could ever cover in this post but to give a quick breakdown I’ll break the IDE into 3 components: The editor, the AWS integrations, and the collaboration.</p> 
<b>Editing</b> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/24/cloud9_editor-1.png" /><br /> The Ace Editor at the core of Cloud9 is what lets you write code quickly, easily, and beautifully. It follows a UNIX philosophy of doing one thing and doing it well: writing code.</p> 
<p>It has all the typical IDE features you would expect: live syntax checking, auto-indent, auto-completion, code folding, split panes, version control integration, multiple cursors and selections, and it also has a few unique features I want to highlight. First of all, it’s fast, even for large (100000+ line) files. There’s no lag or other issues while typing. It has over two dozen themes built-in (solarized!) and you can bring all of your favorite themes from Sublime Text or TextMate as well. It has built-in support for 40+ language modes and customizable run configurations for your projects. Most importantly though, <b>it has Vim mode</b> (or emacs if your fingers work that way). It also has a keybinding editor that allows you to bend the editor to your will.</p> 
<p>The editor supports powerful keyboard navigation and commands (similar to Sublime Text or vim plugins like <a href="https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a>). On a Mac, with <code>⌘+P</code> you can open any file in your environment with fuzzy search. With <code>⌘+.</code> you can open up the command pane which allows you to do invoke any of the editor commands by typing the name. It also helpfully displays the keybindings for a command in the pane, for instance to open to a terminal you can press <code>⌥+T</code>. Oh, did I mention there’s a terminal? It ships with the AWS CLI preconfigured for access to your resources.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/24/cloud9_terminal_1-1.png" /></p> 
<p>The environment also comes with pre-installed debugging tools for many popular languages – but you’re not limited to what’s already installed. It’s easy to add in new programs and define new run configurations.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/23/cloud9_debug_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The editor is just one, admittedly important, component in an IDE though. I want to show you some other compelling features.</p> 
<b>AWS Integrations</b> 
<p>The AWS Cloud9 IDE is the first IDE I’ve used that is truly “cloud native”. The service is provided at no additional charge, and you only charged for the underlying compute and storage resources. When you create an environment you’re prompted for either: an instance type and an auto-hibernate time, or SSH access to a machine of your choice.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/22/cloud9_create_environment.png" /></p> 
<p>If you’re running in AWS the auto-hibernate feature will stop your instance shortly after you stop using your IDE. This can be a huge cost savings over running a more permanent developer desktop. You can also launch it within a VPC to give it secure access to your development resources. If you want to run Cloud9 outside of AWS, or on an existing instance, you can provide SSH access to the service which it will use to create an environment on the external machine. Your environment is provisioned with automatic and secure access to your AWS account so you don’t have to worry about copying credentials around. Let me say that again: you can run this anywhere.</p> 
<h3>Serverless Development with AWS Cloud9</h3> 
<p>I spend a lot of time on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/aws">Twitch</a> developing serverless applications. I have hundreds of lambda functions and APIs deployed. Cloud9 makes working with every single one of these functions delightful. Let me show you how it works.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/24/cloud9_lambda_functions-1.png" /><br /> If you look in the top right side of the editor you’ll see an AWS Resources tab. Opening this you can see all of the lambda functions in your region (you can see functions in other regions by adjusting your region preferences in the AWS preference pane).</p> 
<p>You can import these remote functions to your local workspace just by double-clicking them. This allows you to edit, test, and debug your serverless applications all locally. You can create new applications and functions easily as well. If you click the Lambda icon in the top right of the pane you’ll be prompted to create a new lambda function and Cloud9 will automatically create a <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model" title="Serverless Application Model - SAM">Serverless Application Model</a> template for you as well. The IDE ships with support for the popular <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-local">SAM local</a> tool pre-installed. This is what I use in most of my local testing and serverless development. Since you have a terminal, it’s easy to install additional tools and use other serverless frameworks.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Launching an Environment from AWS CodeStar</h3> 
<p>With <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/" title="AWS CodeStar">AWS CodeStar</a> you can easily provision an end-to-end continuous delivery toolchain for development on AWS. Codestar provides a unified experience for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications using AWS CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, and CodeDeploy suite of services. Now, with a few simple clicks you can provision a Cloud9 environment to develop your application. Your environment will be pre-configured with the code for your CodeStar application already checked out and git credentials already configured.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/23/codestar_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You can easily share this environment with your coworkers which leads me to another extremely useful set of features.</p> 
<b>Collaboration</b> 
<p>One of the many things that sets AWS Cloud9 apart from other editors are the rich collaboration tools. You can invite an IAM user to your environment with a few clicks.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/23/cloud9_share_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You can see what files they’re working on, where their cursors are, and even share a terminal. The chat features is useful as well.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/22/cloud9_collab-1.png" /></p> 
<h3>Things to Know</h3> 
<li>There are no additional charges for this service beyond the underlying compute and storage.</li> 
<li><a href="https://c9.io">c9.io</a> continues to run for existing users. You can continue to use all the features of c9.io and add new team members if you have a team account. In the future, we will provide tools for easy migration of your c9.io workspaces to AWS Cloud9.</li> 
<li>AWS Cloud9 is available in the US West (Oregon), US East (Ohio), US East (N.Virginia), EU (Ireland), and Asia Pacific (Singapore) regions.</li> 
<p>I can’t wait to see what you build with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">AWS Cloud9</a>!</p>

<p>There are only a few things more integrated into my day-to-day life than Alexa. I use my Echo device and the enabled Alexa Skills for turning on lights in my home, checking video from my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J24C0TI">Echo Show </a>to see who is ringing my doorbell, keeping track of my extensive to-do list on a weekly basis, playing music, and lots more. I even have my family members enabling Alexa skills on their Echo devices for all types of activities that they now cannot seem to live without. My mother, who is in a much older generation (<em>please don’t tell her I said that</em>), uses her Echo and the custom Alexa skill I built for her to store her baking recipes. She also enjoys exploring skills that have the latest health and epicurean information. It’s no wonder then, that when I go to work I feel like something is missing. For example, I would love to be able to ask Alexa to read my flash briefing when I get to the office.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-1-LOGO-1024x121.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For those of you that would love to have Alexa as your intelligent assistant at work, I have exciting news. I am delighted to announce <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/alexaforbusiness/"><strong>Alexa for Business</strong></a>, a new service that enables businesses and organizations to bring Alexa into the workplace at scale. <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> not only brings Alexa into your workday to boost your productivity, but also provides tools and resources for organizations to set up and manage Alexa devices at scale, enable private skills, and enroll users.</p> 
<p><strong><u>Making Workplaces Smarter with Alexa for Business</u></strong></p> 
<p><strong>Alexa for Business</strong> brings the Alexa you know and love into the workplace to help all types of workers to be more productive and organized on both personal and shared Echo devices. In the workplace, shared devices can be placed in common areas for anyone to use, and workers can use their personal devices to connect at work and at home.</p> 
<p><strong>End users</strong> can use shared devices or personal devices. Here’s what they can do from each.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Shared devices</span></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Join meetings in conference rooms: You can simply say “Alexa, start the meeting”. Alexa turns on the video conferencing equipment, dials into your conference call, and gets the meeting going.</li> 
<li>Help around the office: access custom skills to help with directions around the office, finding an open conference room, reporting a building equipment problem, or ordering new supplies.</li> 
</ol> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Personal devices</span></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Enable calling and messaging: Alexa helps make phone calls, hands free and can also send messages on your behalf.</li> 
<li>Automatically dial into conference calls: Alexa can join any meeting with a conference call number via voice from home, work, or on the go.</li> 
<li>Intelligent assistant: Alexa can quickly check calendars, help schedule meetings, manage to-do lists, and set reminders.</li> 
<li>Find information: Alexa can help find information in popular business applications like Salesforce, Concur, or Splunk.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Here are some of the controls available to <strong>administrators</strong>:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Provision &amp; Manage Shared Alexa Devices: You can provision and manage shared devices around your workplace using the <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> console. For each device you can set a location, such as a conference room designation, and assign public and private skills for the device.</li> 
<li>Configure Conference Room Settings: Kick off your meetings with a simple “Alexa, start the meeting.” <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> allows you to configure your conference room settings so you can use Alexa to start your meetings and control your conference room equipment, or dial in directly from the Amazon Echo device in the room.</li> 
<li>Manage Users: You can invite users in your organization to enroll their personal Alexa account with your <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> account. Once your users have enrolled, you can enable your custom private skills for them to use on any of the devices in their personal Alexa account, at work or at home.</li> 
<li>Manage Skills: You can assign public skills and custom private skills your organization has created to your shared devices, and make private skills available to your enrolled users.&nbsp; You can create skills groups, which you can then assign to specific shared devices.</li> 
<li>Build Private Skills &amp; Use <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> APIs:&nbsp; Dig into the Alexa Skills Kit and build your own skills.&nbsp; Then you can make these available to the shared devices and enrolled users in your <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> account, all without having to publish them in the public Alexa Skills Store.&nbsp; <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> offers additional APIs, which you can use to add context to your skills and automate administrative tasks.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Let’s take a quick journey into <strong>Alexa for Business</strong>. I’ll first log into the AWS Console and go to the <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> service.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-2-GETTING-STARTED-1024x505.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Once I log in to the service, I am presented with the <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> dashboard. As you can see, I have access to manage Rooms, Shared devices, Users, and Skills, as well as the ability to control conferencing, calendars, and user invitations.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-3-DASHBOARD-copy.png" /></p> 
<p>First, I’ll start by setting up my Alexa devices. <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> provides a Device Setup Tool to setup multiple devices, connect them to your Wi-Fi network, and register them with your <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> account. This is quite different from the setup process for personal Alexa devices. With <strong>Alexa for Business</strong>, you can provision 25 devices at a time.</p> 
<p>Once my devices are provisioned, I can create location profiles for the locations where I want to put these devices (such as in my conference rooms). We call these locations “Rooms” in our <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> console. I can go to the Room profiles menu and create a Room profile. A Room profile contains common settings for the Alexa device in your room, such as the wake word for the device, the address, time zone, unit of measurement, and whether I want to enable outbound calling.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-4-DEVICE-SETUP-borded.png" /></p> 
<p>The next step is to enable skills for the devices I set up. I can enable any skill from the Alexa Skills store, or use the private skills feature to enable skills I built myself and made available to my <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> account. To enable skills for my shared devices, I can go to the Skills menu option and enable skills. After I have enabled skills, I can add them to a skill group and assign the skill group to my rooms.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-5-SKILLS-1024x426.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-6-CREATE-SKILLS-1024x363.png" /></p> 
<p>Something I really like about <strong>Alexa for Business</strong>, is that I can use Alexa to dial into conference calls. To enable this, I go to the Conferencing menu option and select Add provider. At Amazon we use Amazon Chime, but you can choose from a list of different providers, or you can even add your own provider if you want to.</p> 
<p>Once I’ve set this up, I can say “Alexa, join my meeting”; Alexa asks for my Amazon Chime meeting ID, after which my Echo device will automatically dial into my Amazon Chime meeting. <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> also provides an intelligent way to start any meeting quickly. We’ve all been in the situation where we walk into a meeting room and can’t find the meeting ID or conference call number. With <strong>Alexa for Business</strong>, I can link to my corporate calendar, so Alexa can figure out the meeting information for me, and automatically dial in – I don’t even need my meeting ID. Here’s how you do that:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-7-CONFERENCING-1-1024x462.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-8-ADD-PROVIDER-1024x331.png" /></p> 
<p>Alexa can also control the video conferencing equipment in the room. To do this, all I need to do is select the skill for the equipment that I have, select the equipment provider, and enable it for my conference rooms. Now when I ask Alexa to join my meeting, Alexa will dial-in from the equipment in the room, and turn on the video conferencing system, without me needing to do anything else.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-12-CONFERENCE-HARDWARE-1-1024x280.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Let’s switch to enrolled users next.</strong></p> 
<p>I’ll start by setting up the User Invitation for my organization so that I can invite users to my <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> account. To allow a user to use <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> within an organization, you invite them to enroll their personal Alexa account with the service by sending a user invitation via email from the management console. If I choose, I can customize the user enrollment email to contain additional content. For example, I can add information about my organization’s Alexa skills that can be enabled after they’ve accepted the invitation and completed the enrollment process.&nbsp;My users must join in order to use the features of <strong>Alexa for Business</strong>, such as auto dialing into conference calls, linking their Microsoft Exchange calendars, or using private skills.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-9-USER-INVITATIONScorrect-1024x432.png" /></p> 
<p>Now that I have customized my User Invitation, I will invite users to take advantage of <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> for my organization by going to the Users menu on the Dashboard and entering their email address.&nbsp; This will send an email with a link that can be used to join my organization. Users will join using the Amazon account that their personal Alexa devices are registered to. Let’s invite Jeff Barr to join my <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> organization.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-10-INVITE-USER.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-11-REGISTRATION-PORTAL-1-copy.png" /></p> 
<p>After Jeff has enrolled in my <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> account, he can discover the private skills I’ve enabled for enrolled users, and he can access his work skills and join conference calls from any of his personal devices, including the Echo in his home office.</p>

<p>Today we’re launching Amazon Time Sync Service, a time synchronization service delivered over Network Time Protocol (NTP) which uses a fleet of redundant satellite-connected and atomic clocks in each region to deliver a highly accurate reference clock. This service is provided at no additional charge and is immediately available in all public AWS regions to all instances running in a VPC.</p> 
<p>You can access the service via the link local 169.254.169.123 IP address. This means you don’t need to configure external internet access and the service can be securely accessed from within your private subnets.</p> 
<b>Setup</b> 
<p><a href="https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/">Chrony</a> is a different implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">NTP</a> than what ntpd uses and it’s able to synchronize the system clock faster and with better accuracy than ntpd. I’d recommend using Chrony unless you have a legacy reason to use ntpd.</p> 
<p>Installing and configuring chrony on Amazon Linux&nbsp;is as simple as:</p> 
<code>
sudo yum erase ntp*
sudo yum -y install chrony
sudo service chrony start
</code> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/21/ntp_console.png" /></p> 
<p>Alternatively, just modify your existing NTP config by adding the line <code>server 169.254.169.123 prefer iburst</code>.</p> 
<p>On Windows you can run the following commands in PowerShell or a command prompt:</p> 
<code>
net stop w32time
w32tm /config /syncfromflags:manual /manualpeerlist:&quot;169.254.169.123&quot;
w32tm /config /reliable:yes
net start w32time
</code> 
<b>Leap Seconds</b> 
<p>Time is hard. Science, and society, measure time with respect to the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF), which is computed using long baseline interferometry of distant quasars, GPS satellite orbits, and laser ranging of the moon (cool!). Irregularities in Earth’s rate of rotation cause UTC to drift from time with respect to the ICRF. To address this clock drift the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems (IERS) occasionally introduce an extra second into UTC to keep it within 0.9 seconds of real time.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/look-before-you-leap-december-31-2016-leap-second-on-aws/">Leap seconds</a> are known to cause application errors and this can be a concern for many savvy developers and systems administrators. The <code>169.254.169.123</code> clock smooths out leap seconds over a period of time (commonly called leap smearing) which makes it easy for your applications to deal with leap seconds.</p> 
<p>This timely update should provide immediate benefits to anyone previously relying on an external time synchronization service.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/low-cost-burstable-ec2-instances/">first wrote about</a> the T2 instances in the summer of 2014, and talked about how many workloads have a modest demand for continuous compute power and an occasional need for a lot more. This model resonated with our customers; the T2 instances are very popular and are now used to host microservices, low-latency interactive applications, virtual desktops, build &amp; staging environments, prototypes, and the like.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t2/"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New T2 Unlimited</strong></span></a><br /> Today we are extending the burst model that we pioneered with the T2, giving you the ability to sustain high CPU performance over any desired time frame while still keeping your costs as low as possible. You simply enable this feature when you launch your instance; you can also enable it for an instance that is already running. The hourly T2 instance price covers all interim spikes in usage if the average CPU utilization is lower than the baseline over a 24-hour window. There’s a small hourly charge if the instance runs at higher CPU utilization for a prolonged period of time. For example, if you run a <strong>t2.micro</strong> instance at an average of 15% utilization (5% above the baseline) for 24 hours you will be charged an additional 6 cents (5 cents per vCPU-hour * 1 vCPU * 5% * 24 hours).</p> 
<p>To launch a T2 Unlimited instance from the EC2 Console, select any T2 instance and then click on<strong> Enable</strong> next to <strong>T2 Unlimited</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/t2_unlimited_launch_2.png" /></p> 
<p>And here’s how to switch a running instance from T2 Standard to T2 Unlimited:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/t2_switch_to_unlimited_2.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Behind the Scenes</strong></span><br /> As I described in my original post, each T2 instance accumulates CPU Credits as it runs and consumes them while it is running at full-core speed, decelerating to a baseline level when the supply of Credits is exhausted. T2 Unlimited instances have the ability to borrow an entire day’s worth of future credits, allowing them to perform additional bursting. This borrowing is tracked by the new <strong>CPUSurplusCreditBalance</strong> CloudWatch metric. When this balance rises to the level where it represents an entire day’s worth of future credits, the instance continues to deliver full-core performance, charged at the rate of $0.05 per vCPU per hour for Linux and $0.096 for Windows. These charged surplus credits are tracked by the new <strong>CPUSurplusCreditsCharged</strong> metric. You will be charged on a per-millisecond basis for partial hours of bursting (further reducing your costs) if you exhaust your surplus late in a given hour.</p> 
<p>The charge for any remaining <strong>CPUSurplusCreditBalance</strong> is processed when the instance is terminated or configured as a T2 Standard. Any accumulated <strong>CPUCreditBalance</strong> carries over during the transition to T2 Standard.</p> 
<p>The T2 Unlimited model is designed to spare you the trouble of watching the CloudWatch metrics, but (if you are like me) you will do it anyway. Let’s take a quick look at a <strong>t2.nano </strong>and watch the credits over time. First, CPU utilization grows to 100% and the instance begins to consume 5 credits every 5 minutes (one credit is equivalent to a VCPU-minute):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/t2u_usage_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The CPU credit balance remains at 0 because the credits are being produced and consumed at the same rate. The surplus credit balance (tracked by the <strong>CPUSurplusCreditBalance</strong> metric) ramps up to 72, representing the credits that are being borrowed from the future:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/t2u_cred_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Once the surplus credit balance hits 72, there’s nothing more to borrow from the future, and any further CPU usage is charged at the end of the hour, tracked with the <strong>CPUSurplusCreditsCharged</strong> metric. The instance consumes 5 credits every 5 minutes and earns 0.25, resulting in a net charge of 4.75 VCPU-minutes for each 5 minutes of bursting:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/t2u_charge_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You can switch each of your instances back and forth between T2 Standard and T2 Unlimited at any time; all credit balances except <strong>CPUSurplusCreditsCharged</strong> remain and are carried over. Because T2 Unlimited instances have the ability to burst at any time, they do not receive the 30 minutes of credits given to newly launched T2 Standard instances. Also, since each AWS account can launch a limited number of T2 Standard instances with initial CPU credits each day, T2 Unlimited instances can be a better fit for use in Auto Scaling Groups and other scenarios where large numbers of instances come and go each day.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/">AWS Systems Manager</a> is a new way to manage your cloud and hybrid IT environments. AWS Systems Manager provides a unified user interface that simplifies resource and application management, shortens the time to detect and resolve operational problems, and makes it easy to operate and manage your infrastructure securely at scale. This service is absolutely packed full of features. It defines a new experience around grouping, visualizing, and reacting to problems using features from products like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/systems-manager/" title="Systems Manager">Amazon EC2 Systems Manager (SSM)</a> to enable rich operations across your resources.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/29/console_first_shot.png" /></p> 
<p>As I said above, there are a lot of powerful features in this service and we won’t be able to dive deep on all of them but it’s easy to go to the console and get started with any of the tools.</p> 
<b>Resource Groupings</b> 
<p>Resource Groups allow you to create logical groupings of most resources that support tagging like: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" title="">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</a> instances, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a> buckets, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing" title="">Elastic Load Balancing</a> balancers, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" title="">Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)</a> instances, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/" title="">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/" title="">Amazon Kinesis</a> streams, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/" title="">Amazon Route 53</a> zones, and more. Previously, you could use the AWS Console to define resource groupings but AWS Systems Manager provides this new resource group experience via a new console and API. These groupings are a fundamental building block of Systems Manager in that they are frequently the target of various operations you may want to perform like: compliance management, software inventories, patching, and other automations.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/26/resource_groups.png" /></p> 
<p>You start by defining a group based on tag filters. From there you can view all of the resources in a centralized console. You would typically use these groupings to differentiate between applications, application layers, and environments like production or dev – but you can make your own rules about how to use them as well. If you imagine a typical 3 tier web-app you might have a few EC2 instances, an ELB, a few S3 buckets, and an RDS instance. You can define a grouping for that application and with all of those different resources simultaneously.</p> 
<b>Insights</b> 
<p>AWS Systems Manager automatically aggregates and displays operational data for each resource group through a dashboard. You no longer need to navigate through multiple AWS consoles to view all of your operational data. You can easily integrate your exiting <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" title="">Amazon CloudWatch</a> dashboards, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/config/" title="">AWS Config</a> rules, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/" title="">AWS CloudTrail</a> trails, AWS Trusted Advisor notifications, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/phd/" title="">AWS Personal Health Dashboard</a> performance and availability alerts. You can also easily view your software inventories across your fleet. AWS Systems Manager also provides a compliance dashboard allowing you to see the state of various security controls and patching operations across your fleets.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/26/inventory_1.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/26/compliance_1.png" /></p> 
<b>Acting on Insights</b> 
<p>Building on the success of EC2 Systems Manager (SSM), AWS Systems Manager takes all of the features of SSM and provides a central place to access them. These are all the same experiences you would have through SSM with a more accesible console and centralized interface. You can use the resource groups you’ve defined in Systems Manager to visualize and act on groups of resources.</p> 
<h3>Automation</h3> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/26/automation_1.png" /><br /> Automations allow you to define common IT tasks as a JSON document that specify a list of tasks. You can also use community published documents. These documents can be executed through the Console, CLIs, SDKs, scheduled maintenance windows, or triggered based on changes in your infrastructure through CloudWatch events. You can track and log the execution of each step in the documents and prompt for additional approvals. It also allows you to incrementally roll out changes and automatically halt when errors occur. You can start executing an automation directly on a resource group and it will be able to apply itself to the resources that it understands within the group.</p> 
<h3>Run Command</h3> 
<p>Run Command is a superior alternative to enabling SSH on your instances. It provides safe, secure remote management of your instances at scale without logging into your servers, replacing the need for SSH bastions or remote powershell. It has granular IAM permissions that allow you to restrict which roles or users can run&nbsp;certain&nbsp;commands.</p> 
<h3>Patch Manager, Maintenance Windows, and State Manager</h3> 
<p>I’ve written about <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ec2-systems-manager-patch-manager-now-supports-linux/">Patch Manager</a> before and if you manage fleets of Windows and Linux instances it’s a great way to maintain a common baseline of security across your fleet.</p> 
<p>Maintenance windows allow you to schedule instance maintenance and other disruptive tasks for a specific time window.</p> 
<p>State Manager allows you to control various server configuration details like anti-virus definitions, firewall settings, and more. You can define policies in the console or run existing scripts, PowerShell modules, or even Ansible playbooks directly from S3 or GitHub. You can query State Manager at any time to view the status of your instance configurations.</p> 
<b>Things To Know</b> 
<p>There’s some interesting terminology here. We haven’t done the best job of naming things in the past so let’s take a moment to clarify. EC2 Systems Manager (sometimes called SSM) is what you used before today. You can still invoke <code>aws ssm</code> commands. However, AWS Systems Manager builds on and enhances many of the tools provided by EC2 Systems Manager and allows those same tools to be applied to more than just EC2. When you see the phrase “Systems Manager” in the future you should think of AWS Systems Manager and not EC2 Systems Manager.</p> 
<p>AWS Systems Manager with all of this useful functionality is provided at no additional charge. It is immediately available in all public AWS regions.</p> 
<p>The best part about these services is that even with their tight integrations each one is designed to be used in isolation as well. If you only need one component of these services it’s simple to get started with only that component.</p> 
<p>There’s a lot more than I could ever document in this post so I encourage you all to jump into the&nbsp;<a href="https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fsystems-manager%2Fhome%3Fstate%3DhashArgs%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue&amp;client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A015428540659%3Auser%2Fssm&amp;forceMobileApp=0">console</a> and<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-systems-manager.html"> documentation</a> to figure out where you can start using AWS Systems Manager.</p>

<p>I was recently reading an article on ReadWrite.com titled “<a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/12/21/iot-devices-increase-200-worldwide-five-years-dl4/">IoT devices go forth and multiply, to increase 200% by 2021</a>“, and while the article noted the benefit for consumers and the industry of this growth, two things in the article stuck with me. The first was the specific statement that read “researchers warned that the proliferation of IoT technology will create a new bevvy of challenges. Particularly troublesome will be IoT deployments at scale for both end-users and providers.” Not only was that sentence a mouthful, but it really addressed some of the challenges that can come building solutions and deployment of this exciting new technology area. The second sentiment in the article that stayed with me was that Security issues could grow.</p> 
<p>So the article got me thinking, how can we create these cool IoT solutions using low-cost efficient microcontrollers with a secure operating system that can easily connect to the cloud. Luckily the answer came to me by way of an exciting new open-source based offering coming from AWS that I am happy to announce to you all today. Let’s all welcome, Amazon&nbsp;FreeRTOS to the technology stage.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/freertos/"><strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong></a> is an IoT microcontroller operating system that&nbsp;simplifies development, security, deployment, and maintenance of microcontroller-based edge devices. Amazon FreeRTOS extends the FreeRTOS kernel, a popular real-time operating system, with libraries that enable local and cloud connectivity, security, and (coming soon) over-the-air updates.</p> 
<p>So what are some of the great benefits of this new exciting offering, you ask. They are as follows:</p> 
<li><strong>Easily to create solutions for Low Power Connected Devices</strong>: provides a common operating system (OS) and libraries that make the development of common IoT capabilities easy for devices. For example; over-the-air (OTA) updates&nbsp;<em>(coming soon)</em> and&nbsp;device configuration.</li> 
<li><strong>Secure Data and Device Connections:&nbsp;</strong>devices only run trusted software using the Code Signing service, Amazon FreeRTOS provides a secure connection to the AWS using TLS, as well as, the ability to securely store keys and sensitive data on the device.</li> 
<li><strong>Extensive Ecosystem:&nbsp;</strong>contains an&nbsp;extensive hardware and technology ecosystem that allows you to choose a variety of qualified chipsets, including Texas Instruments, Microchip, NXP Semiconductors, and STMicroelectronics.</li> 
<li><strong>Cloud or Local Connections:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Devices can connect directly to the AWS Cloud or via <strong>AWS Greengrass</strong>.</li> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span style="color: #3366ff"><strong>What’s cool is that it is easy to get started.</strong>&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p>The <strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong> console allows you to select and download the software that you need for your solution.</p> 
<p>There is a Qualification Program that helps to assure you that the microcontroller you choose will run consistently across several hardware options.</p> 
<p>Finally, <strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong> kernel is an open-source FreeRTOS operating system that is freely available on GitHub for download.</p> 
<p>But I couldn’t leave you without at least showing you a few snapshots of the <strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong> Console.</p> 
<p>Within the <strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong> Console, I can select a predefined software configuration that I would like to use.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AmazonFreeRTOS-02-NewSoftwareConfig1.png" /></p>

<p>One of the technology areas I thoroughly enjoy is the Internet of Things (IoT). Even as a child I used to infuriate my parents by taking apart the toys they would purchase for me to see how they worked and if I could somehow put them back together. It seems somehow I was destined to end up the tough and ever-changing world of technology. Therefore, it’s no wonder that I am really enjoying learning and tinkering with IoT devices and technologies. It combines my love of development and software engineering with my curiosity around circuits, controllers, and other facets of the electrical engineering discipline; even though an electrical engineer I can not claim to be.</p> 
<p>Despite all of the information that is collected by the deployment of IoT devices and solutions, I honestly never really thought about the need to analyze, search, and process this data <strong>until</strong> I came up against a scenario where it became of the utmost importance to be able to search and query through loads of sensory data for an anomaly occurrence. Of course, I understood the importance of analytics for businesses to make accurate decisions and predictions to drive the organization’s direction. But it didn’t occur to me initially, how important it was to make analytics an integral part of my IoT solutions. Well, I learned my lesson just in time because this re:Invent a service is launching to make it easier for anyone to process and analyze IoT messages and device data.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Hello, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-analytics/"><strong>AWS IoT Analytics</strong></a>! &nbsp;<strong>AWS IoT Analytics</strong> is a fully managed service of <strong>AWS IoT</strong> that provides advanced data analysis of data collected from your IoT devices.&nbsp; With the <strong>AWS IoT Analytics</strong> service, you can process messages, gather and store large amounts of device data, as well as, query your data. Also, the new <strong>AWS IoT</strong> <strong>Analytics</strong> service feature integrates with <strong>Amazon Quicksight</strong> for visualization of your data and brings the power of machine learning through integration with <strong>Jupyter Notebooks</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Benefits of AWS IoT Analytics</strong></p> 
<li>Helps with predictive analysis of data by providing access to pre-built analytical functions</li> 
<li>Provides ability to visualize analytical output from service</li> 
<li>Provides tools to clean up data</li> 
<li>Can help identify patterns in the gathered data</li> 
<p><strong>Be In the Know: IoT Analytics Concepts </strong></p> 
<li><strong>Channel</strong>: archives the raw, unprocessed messages and collects data from MQTT topics.</li> 
<li><strong>Pipeline</strong>: consumes messages from channels and allows message processing. 
<li><em><strong>Activities</strong></em>: perform transformations on your messages including filtering attributes and invoking lambda functions advanced processing.</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li><strong>Data Store</strong>: Used as a queryable repository for processed messages. Provide ability to have multiple datastores for messages coming from different devices or locations or filtered by message attributes.</li> 
<li><strong>Data Set</strong>: Data retrieval view from a data store, can be generated by a recurring schedule.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li> 
<p><strong>Getting Started with AWS IoT Analytics</strong></p> 
<p>First, I’ll create a channel to receive incoming messages.&nbsp; This channel can be used to ingest data sent to the channel via MQTT or messages directed from the Rules Engine. To create a channel, I’ll select the <strong>Channels</strong> menu option and then click the <strong>Create a channel</strong> button.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-01-CreateChannel.png" /></p> 
<p>I’ll name my channel, <strong>TaraIoTAnalyticsID</strong> and give the <strong>Channel</strong> a <strong>MQTT topic filter</strong> of <strong>Temperature</strong>. To complete the creation of my channel, I will click the <strong>Create Channel</strong> button.<img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-02-ChannelID.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-03-ChannelCreated.png" /></p> 
<p>Now that I have my <strong>Channel</strong> created, I need to create a <strong>Data Store</strong> to receive and store the messages received on the <strong>Channel</strong> from my IoT device. Remember you can set up multiple Data Stores for more complex solution needs, but I’ll just create one <strong>Data Store</strong> for my example. I’ll select <strong>Data Stores</strong> from menu panel and click <strong>Create a data store</strong>.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-04-CreateDatasource.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I’ll name my <strong>Data Store</strong>, <strong>TaraDataStoreID</strong>, and once I click the <strong>Create the data store</strong> button and I would have successfully set up a <strong>Data Store</strong> to house messages coming from my <strong>Channel</strong>.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-06-DatasourceCreated.png" /></p> 
<p>Now that I have my <strong>Channel</strong> and my <strong>Data Store</strong>, I will need to connect the two using a <strong>Pipeline</strong>. I’ll create a simple pipeline that just connects my Channel and Data Store, but you can create a more robust pipeline to process and filter messages by adding Pipeline activities like a <strong>Lambda activity</strong>.</p> 
<p>To create a pipeline, I’ll select the <strong>Pipelines</strong> menu option and then click the <strong>Create a pipeline</strong> button.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-07-CreatePipeline.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-08-PipelineID.png" /></p> 
<p>I will not add an <strong>Attribute</strong> for this pipeline. So I will click <strong>Next&nbsp;</strong>button.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-09-Attributes.png" /></p> 
<p>As we discussed there are additional pipeline activities that I can add to my pipeline for the processing and transformation of messages but I will keep my first pipeline simple and hit the <strong>Next</strong> button.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-10-Activities.png" /></p> 
<p>The final step in creating my pipeline is for me to select my previously created <strong>Data Store</strong> and click <strong>Create Pipeline</strong>.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-11-PipelineCreateLastStep.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-12-PipelineCreated.png" /></p> 
<p>All that is left for me to take advantage of the <strong>AWS IoT Analytics</strong> service is to create an IoT rule that sends data to an AWS IoT Analytics channel.&nbsp; Wow, that was a super easy process to set up analytics for IoT devices.</p> 
<p>If I wanted to create a <strong>Data Set</strong> as a result of queries run against my data for visualization with <strong>Amazon Quicksight</strong> or integrate with <strong>Jupyter Notebooks </strong>to&nbsp;perform more advanced analytical functions, I can choose the <strong>Analyze</strong> menu option to bring up the screens to create data sets and access the <strong>Juypter Notebook</strong> instances.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-13-DataSet.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-14-Notebooks.png" /></p> 
<p><strong><u>Summary</u></strong></p> 
<p>As you can see, it was a very simple process to set up the advanced data analysis for AWS IoT. With AWS IoT Analytics, you have the ability to collect, visualize, process, query and store large amounts of data generated from your AWS IoT connected device. Additionally, you can access the AWS IoT Analytics service in a myriad of different ways; the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the AWS IoT API, language-specific AWS SDKs, and AWS IoT Device SDKs.</p> 
<p>AWS IoT Analytics is available today for you to dig into the analysis of your IoT data. To learn more about AWS IoT and AWS IoT Analytics go to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-analytics/">AWS IoT Analytics product page</a> and/or the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/iot/">AWS IoT documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Scale takes on a whole new meaning when it comes to IoT. Last year I was lucky enough to tour a gigantic factory that had, on average, one environment sensor per square meter. The sensors measured temperature, humidity, and air purity several times per second, and served as an early warning system for contaminants. I’ve heard customers express interest in deploying IoT-enabled consumer devices in the millions or tens of millions.</p> 
<p>With powerful, long-lived devices deployed in a geographically distributed fashion, managing security challenges is crucial. However, the limited amount of local compute power and memory can sometimes limit the ability to use encryption and other forms of data protection.</p> 
<p>To address these challenges and to allow our customers to confidently deploy IoT devices at scale, we are working on <span title="">IoT Device Defender</span>. While the details might change before release, <span title="">AWS IoT Device Defender</span> is designed to offer these benefits:</p> 
<p><strong>Continuous Auditing</strong> – <span title="">AWS IoT Device Defender</span> monitors the policies related to your devices to ensure that the desired security settings are in place. It looks for drifts away from best practices and supports custom audit rules so that you can check for conditions that are specific to your deployment. For example, you could check to see if a compromised device has subscribed to sensor data from another device. You can run audits on a schedule or on an as-needed basis.</p> 
<p><strong>Real-Time Detection and Alerting</strong> – <span title="">AWS IoT Device Defender</span> looks for and quickly alerts you to unusual behavior that could be coming from a compromised device. It does this by monitoring the behavior of similar devices over time, looking for unauthorized access attempts, changes in connection patterns, and changes in traffic patterns (either inbound or outbound).</p> 
<p><strong>Fast Investigation and Mitigation</strong> – In the event that you get an alert that something unusual is happening, <span title="">AWS IoT Device Defender</span> gives you the tools, including contextual information, to help you to investigate and mitigate the problem. Device information, device statistics, diagnostic logs, and previous alerts are all at your fingertips. You have the option to reboot the device, revoke its permissions, reset it to factory defaults, or push a security fix.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Stay Tuned</strong></span><br /> I’ll have more info (and a hands-on post) as soon as possible, so stay tuned!</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot" title="">AWS IoT</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass" title="">AWS Greengrass</a> give you a solid foundation and programming environment for your IoT devices and applications.</p> 
<p>The nature of IoT means that an at-scale device deployment often encompasses millions or even tens of millions of devices deployed at hundreds or thousands of locations. At that scale, treating each device individually is impossible. You need to be able to set up, monitor, update, and eventually retire devices in bulk, collective fashion while also retaining the flexibility to accommodate varying deployment configurations, device models, and so forth.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New AWS IoT Device Management</strong></span><br /> Today we are launching <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-device-management/"><span title="">AWS IoT Device Management</span></a> to help address this challenge. It will help you through each phase of the device lifecycle, from manufacturing to retirement. Here’s what you get:</p> 
<p><strong>Onboarding</strong> – Starting with devices in their as-manufactured state, you can control the provisioning workflow. You can use IoT Device Management templates to quickly onboard entire fleets of devices with a few clicks. The templates can include information about device certificates and access policies.</p> 
<p><strong>Organization</strong> – In order to deal with massive numbers of devices, <span title="">AWS IoT Device Management</span> extends the existing IoT Device Registry and allows you to create a hierarchical model of your fleet and to set policies on a hierarchical basis. You can drill-down through the hierarchy in order to locate individual devices. You can also query your fleet on attributes such as device type or firmware version.</p> 
<p><strong>Monitoring</strong> – Telemetry from the devices is used to gather real-time connection, authentication, and status metrics, which are published to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" title="">Amazon CloudWatch</a>. You can examine the metrics and locate outliers for further investigation. IoT Device Management lets you configure the log level for each device group, and you can also publish change events for the Registry and Jobs for monitoring purposes.</p> 
<p><strong>Remote Management</strong> – <span title="">AWS IoT Device Management</span> lets you remotely manage your devices. You can push new software and firmware to them, reset to factory defaults, reboot, and set up bulk updates at the desired velocity.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Exploring AWS IoT Device Management</strong></span><br /> The <span title="">AWS IoT Device Management</span> Console took me on a tour and pointed out how to access each of the features of the service:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/iotdm_tour_1.jpg" /></p> 
<p>I already have a large set of devices (pressure gauges):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dm_gauges_1.jpg" /></p> 
<p>These gauges were created using the new template-driven bulk registration feature. Here’s how I create a template:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dm_create_template_1.jpg" /></p> 
<p>The gauges are organized into groups (by US state in this case):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dm_thing_groups_1.jpg" /></p> 
<p>Here are the gauges in Colorado:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dm_things_in_co_1.png" /></p> 
<p>AWS IoT group policies allow you to control access to specific IoT resources and actions for all members of a group. The policies are structured very much like IAM policies, and can be created in the console:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dm_make_policy_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Jobs are used to selectively update devices. Here’s how I create one:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dm_jobs_1.png" /></p> 
<p>As indicated by the <strong>Job type</strong> above, jobs can run either once or continuously. Here’s how I choose the devices to be updated:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dm_pick_your_ear_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I can create custom authorizers that make use of a Lambda function:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dm_custom_auth_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I’ve shown you a medium-sized subset of <span title="">AWS IoT Device Management</span> in this post. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-device-management/">Check it out</a> for yourself to learn more!</p>
