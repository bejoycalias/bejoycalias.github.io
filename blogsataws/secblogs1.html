<p>Now, your applications and federated users can complete longer running workloads in a single session by increasing the maximum session duration up to 12 hours for an IAM role. Users and applications still retrieve temporary credentials by assuming roles using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Security Token Service</a> (AWS STS), but these credentials can now be valid for up to 12 hours when using the AWS SDK or CLI. This change allows your users and applications to perform longer running workloads, such as a batch upload to S3 or a CloudFormation template, using a single session. You can extend the maximum session duration using the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IAM console</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLI</a>. Once you increase the maximum session duration, users and applications assuming the IAM role can request temporary credentials that expire when the IAM role session expires.</p> 
<p>In this post, I show you how to configure the maximum session duration for an existing IAM role to 4 hours (maximum allowed duration is 12 hours) using the IAM console. I’ll use 4 hours because AWS recommends configuring the session duration for a role to the shortest duration that your federated users would require to access your AWS resources. I’ll then show how existing federated users can use the AWS SDK or CLI to request temporary security credentials that are valid until the role session expires.</p> 
<b>Prerequisites</b> 
<p>In this post, I’ll use a federation example. If you have an existing identity provider, you might have enabled federation by using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/identity/saml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)</a> to allow your users to access your AWS resources. This post assumes you have <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">created an IAM role for a third-party identity provider</a> that defines the permissions for your federated users. You could also have <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html#CreatingSAML-configuring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">configured SAML-based federation for API access to AWS</a>. For my example, I’ve chosen to configure SAML-based federation using Microsoft Active Directory Federation Service (ADFS) as the identity provider (IdP).</p> 
<b>Configure the maximum session duration for an existing IAM role to 4 hours</b> 
<p>Let’s assume you have an existing IAM role called ADFS-Production that allows your federated users to upload objects to an S3 bucket in your AWS account. You want to extend the maximum session duration for this role to 4 hours. By default, IAM roles in your AWS accounts have a maximum session duration of one hour. To extend a role’s maximum session duration to 4 hours, follow the steps below:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Sign in to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IAM console</a>.</li> 
<li>In the left navigation pane, select <strong>Roles</strong> and then select the role for which you want to increase the maximum session duration. For this example, I select <code>ADFS-Production</code> and verify the maximum session duration for this role. This value is set to 1 hour (3,600 seconds) by default.</li> 
<li>Select <strong>Edit</strong>, and then define the maximum session duration.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/03/27/federated-api-requests-02.png" /> </li> 
<p> &nbsp;</p> 
<li>Select one of the predefined durations or provide a custom duration. For this example, I set the maximum session duration to be 4 hours. </li> 
<li>Select <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Alternatively, you can use the latest <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS CLI</a> and call <code>Update-Role</code> to set the maximum session duration for the role <code>ADFS-Production</code>. Here’s an example to set the maximum session duration to 14,400 seconds (4 hours).</p> 
<p><code>$ aws iam update-role -–role-name ADFS-Production -–max-session-duration 14400</code></p> 
<p>Now that you’ve successfully extended the maximum session for your IAM role, ADFS-Production, your federated users can use AWS STS to retrieve temporary credentials that are valid for 4 hours to access your S3 buckets.</p> 
<b>Access AWS resources with temporary security credentials using AWS CLI/SDK</b> 
<p>To enable federated SDK and CLI access for your users who use temporary security credentials, you might have implemented the solution described in the blog post on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-implement-federated-api-and-cli-access-using-saml-2-0-and-ad-fs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Implement Federated API and CLI Access Using SAML 2.0 and AD FS</a>. That blog post demonstrates how to use the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Python SDK</a> and some additional client-side integration code provided in the post to implement federated SDK and CLI access for your users. To enable your users to request longer temporary security credentials, you can make the following changes suggested in this blog to the solution provided in that post.</p> 
<p>When calling <a href="https://docs-aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithSAML.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AssumeRoleWithSAML API</a> to request AWS temporary security credentials, you need to include the DurationSeconds parameter. The value of this parameter is the duration the user requests and, therefore, the duration their temporary security credentials are valid. In this example, I am using <a href="https://github.com/boto/boto3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">boto</a> to request the maximum length of 14,400 seconds (4 hours) using code from the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-implement-federated-api-and-cli-access-using-saml-2-0-and-ad-fs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Implement Federated API and CLI Access Using SAML 2.0 and AD FS</a> post that I have updated:</p> 
<p><code># Use the assertion to get an AWS STS token using Assume Role with SAML<br /> conn = boto.sts.connect_to_region(region)<br /> token = conn.assume_role_with_saml(role_arn, principal_arn, assertion, 14400)</code></p> 
<p>By adding a value for the DurationSeconds parameter in the AssumeRoleWithSAML call, your federated user can retrieve temporary security credentials that are valid for up to 14,400 seconds (4 hours). If you don’t provide this value, the default session duration is 1 hour.</p> 
<b>Conclusion</b> 
<p>I demonstrated how you can configure the maximum session duration for a role from 1 hour (default) up to 12 hours. Then, I showed you how your federated users can retrieve temporary security credentials that are valid for longer durations to access AWS resources using AWS CLI/SDK for up to 12 hours.</p> 
<p>Similarly, you can also increase the maximum role session duration for your applications and users who use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web Identity or OpenID Connect Federation</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cross-Account Access with Assume Role</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Update from March 28, 2018</strong>: We updated the Amazon Trust Services table by replacing an out-of-date value with a new value.</p> 
<hr /> 
<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS, formerly called Secure Sockets Layer [SSL]) is essential for encrypting information that is exchanged on the internet. For example, Amazon.com uses TLS for all traffic on its website, and AWS uses it to secure calls to AWS services.</p> 
<p>An electronic document called a <em>certificate</em>&nbsp;verifies the identity of the server when creating such an encrypted connection. The certificate helps establish proof that your web browser is communicating securely with the website that you typed in your browser’s address field. <em>Certificate Authorities</em>, also known as CAs, issue certificates to specific domains. When a domain presents a certificate that is issued by a trusted CA, your browser or application knows it’s safe to make the connection.</p> 
<p>In January 2016, AWS launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/acm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Certificate Manager</a> (ACM), a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy SSL/TLS certificates for use with AWS services. These certificates are available for no additional charge through Amazon’s own CA: <a href="https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Trust Services</a>. For browsers and other applications to trust a certificate, the certificate’s issuer must be included in the browser’s <em>trust store</em>, which is a list of trusted CAs. If the issuing CA is not in the trust store, the browser will display an error message (see an <a href="https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example</a>) and applications will show an application-specific error. To ensure the ubiquity of the Amazon Trust Services CA, AWS purchased the Starfield Services CA, a root found in most browsers and which has been valid since 2005. This means you shouldn’t have to take any action to use the certificates issued by Amazon Trust Services.</p> 
<p>AWS has been offering free certificates to AWS customers from the Amazon Trust Services CA. Now, AWS is in the process of moving certificates for services such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EC2</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon DynamoDB</a> to use certificates from Amazon Trust Services as well. Most software doesn’t need to be changed to handle this transition, but there are exceptions. In this blog post, I show you how to verify that you are prepared to use the Amazon Trust Services CA.</p> 
<h3>How to tell if the Amazon Trust Services CAs are in your trust store</h3> 
<p>The following table lists the Amazon Trust Services certificates. To verify that these certificates are in your browser’s trust store, click each Test URL in the following table to verify that it works for you. When a Test URL does not work, it displays an error similar to <a href="https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this example</a>.<span id="more-5777"></span></p>

</table> 
<p><strong>* Note</strong>: Amazon doesn’t own this root and doesn’t have a test URL for it. The certificate can be downloaded from <a href="https://certs.secureserver.net/repository/sf-class2-root.crt" title="undefined" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> 
<p>You can calculate the SHA-256 hash of Subject Public Key Information as follows. With the PEM-encoded certificate stored in certificate.pem, run the following <code>openssl</code> commands:</p> 
<p><code>openssl x509 -in certificate.pem -noout -pubkey | openssl asn1parse -noout -inform pem -out certificate.key<br /> openssl dgst -sha256 certificate.key</code></p> 
<p>As an example, with the Starfield Class 2 Certification Authority self-signed cert in a PEM encoded file <code>sf-class2-root.crt</code>, you can use the following <code>openssl</code> commands:</p> 
<p><code>openssl x509 -in sf-class2-root.crt -noout -pubkey | openssl asn1parse -noout -inform pem -out sf-class2-root.key<br /> openssl dgst -sha256 sf-class2-root.key ~<br /> SHA256(sf-class2-root.key)= 15f14ac45c9c7da233d3479164e8137fe35ee0f38ae858183f08410ea82ac4b4</code></p> 
<h3>What to do if the Amazon Trust Services CAs are not in your trust store</h3> 
<p>If your tests of any of the Test URLs failed, you must update your trust store. The easiest way to update your trust store is to upgrade the operating system or browser that you are using.</p> 
<p>You will find the Amazon Trust Services CAs in the following operating systems (release dates are in parentheses):</p> 
<li>Microsoft Windows versions that have January 2005 or later updates installed, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and newer versions</li> 
<li>Mac OS X 10.4 with Java for Mac OS X 10.4 Release 5, Mac OS X 10.5 and newer versions</li> 
<li>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (March 2007), Linux 6, and Linux 7 and CentOS 5, CentOS 6, and CentOS 7</li> 
<li>Ubuntu 8.10</li> 
<li>Debian 5.0</li> 
<li>Amazon Linux (all versions)</li> 
<li>Java 1.4.2_12, Java 5 update 2, and all newer versions, including Java 6, Java 7, and Java 8</li> 
<p>All modern browsers trust Amazon’s CAs. You can update the certificate bundle in your browser simply by updating your browser. You can find instructions for updating the following browsers on their respective websites:</p> 
<li><a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome</a></li> 
<li><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/update-firefox-latest-version" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox</a></li> 
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Safari</a></li> 
<li>The Windows operating system manages certificate bundles for <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/which-version-am-i-using#ie=other" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge</a>, so you must update Windows as well.</li> 
<p>If your application is using a custom trust store, you must add the <a href="https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon root CAs</a> to your application’s trust store. The instructions for doing this vary based on the application or platform. Please refer to the documentation for the application or platform you are using.</p> 
<h4>AWS SDKs and CLIs</h4> 
<p>Most&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS SDKs and CLIs</a> are not impacted by the transition to the Amazon Trust Services CA. If you are using a version of the Python AWS SDK or CLI released before October 29, 2013, you&nbsp;must upgrade. The .NET, Java, PHP, Go, JavaScript, and C++ SDKs and CLIs do not bundle any certificates, so their certificates come from the underlying operating system. The Ruby SDK has included at least one of the required CAs since June 10, 2015. Before that date, the Ruby V2 SDK did not bundle certificates.</p> 
<h3>Certificate pinning</h3> 
<p>If you are using a technique called <em>certificate pinning</em> to lock down the CAs you trust on a domain-by-domain basis, you must adjust your pinning to include the Amazon Trust Services CAs. Certificate pinning helps defend you from an attacker&nbsp;using&nbsp;misissued certificates to fool an application into creating a connection to a spoofed host (an illegitimate host masquerading as a legitimate host). The restriction to a specific, pinned certificate is made by checking that the certificate issued is the expected certificate. This is done by checking that the hash of the certificate public key received from the server matches the expected hash stored in the application. If the hashes do not match, the code stops the connection.</p> 
<p>AWS recommends against using certificate pinning because it introduces a potential availability risk. If the certificate to which you pin is replaced, your application will fail to connect. If your use case requires pinning, we&nbsp;recommend that you pin to a CA rather than to an individual certificate. If you are pinning to an Amazon Trust Services CA, you should pin to all&nbsp;CAs shown in the table earlier in this post.</p>

<p>Australian public sector customers now have a clear roadmap to use our secure services for sensitive workloads at the PROTECTED level. For the first time, we’ve released our Information Security Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) PROTECTED documentation via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/" title="undefined" target="_blank">AWS Artifact</a>. This information provides the ability to plan, architect, and self-assess systems built in AWS under the <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/what-we-do/policies-and-programs/secure-cloud/" title="undefined" target="_blank">Digital Transformation Agency’s Secure Cloud Guidelines</a>.</p> 
<p>In short, this documentation gives public sector customers everything needed to evaluate AWS at the PROTECTED level. And we’re making this resource available to download on-demand through AWS Artifact. When you download the guide, you’ll find a mapping of how AWS meets each requirement to securely and compliantly process PROTECTED data.</p> 
<p>With the AWS IRAP PROTECTED documentation, the process of adopting our secure services has never been easier. The information enables individual agencies to complete their own assessments and adopt AWS, but we also continue to work with the <a href="https://www.asd.gov.au/" title="undefined" target="_blank">Australian Signals Directorate</a> to include our services at the PROTECTED level on the <a href="https://www.asd.gov.au/infosec/irap/certified_clouds.htm" title="undefined" target="_blank">Certified Cloud Services List</a>.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, we’re also excited to announce that there are now 46 services in scope, which mean more options to build secure and innovative solutions, while also saving money and gaining the productivity of the cloud.</p> 
<p>If you have questions about this announcement or would like to inquire about how to use AWS for your regulated workloads, contact your account team.</p>

<p>Recent amendments to the Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act) established the Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme in Australia, which went into effect February 22, 2018. The NDB scheme aims to give affected individuals the opportunity to take steps to protect their personal information following a data breach that is likely to result in serious harm. It also reinforces entities’ accountability for the personal information they hold.</p> 
<p>We’re happy to announce AWS offers an Australian Notifiable Data Breaches (ANDB) Addendum to customers who are subject to the Privacy Act and are using AWS to store and process personal information covered by the NDB scheme. The ANDB Addendum addresses customers’ need for notification if a security event affects their data. We have made the ANDB Addendum available online as a click-through agreement in AWS Artifact, where customers can review and activate the ANDB Addendum for AWS accounts they use to store and process personal information covered by the NDB scheme.</p> 
<p>We welcome the arrival of the NDB scheme, and hope it encourages Australian entities to raise the bar on their security capabilities. At AWS, we continually maintain a high bar for security across all of our AWS Regions around the world. </p>

<p>Today, I’m very pleased to announce that AWS services comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This means that, in addition to benefiting from all of the measures that AWS already takes to maintain services security, customers can deploy AWS services as a key part of their GDPR compliance plans.</p> 
<p>This announcement confirms we have completed the entirety of our GDPR service readiness audit, validating that all generally available services and features adhere to the high privacy bar and data protection standards required of data processors by the GDPR. We completed this work two months ahead of the May 25, 2018 enforcement deadline in order to give customers and APN partners an environment in which they can confidently build their own GDPR-compliant products, services, and solutions.</p> 
<p>AWS’s GDPR service readiness is only part of the story; we are continuing to work alongside our customers and the AWS Partner Network (APN) to help on their journey toward GDPR compliance. Along with this announcement, I’d like to highlight the following examples of ways AWS can help you accelerate your own GDPR compliance efforts.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Security of Personal Data</strong></span><br /> During our GDPR service readiness audit, our security and compliance experts confirmed that AWS has in place effective technical and organizational measures for data processors to secure personal data in accordance with the GDPR. Security remains our highest priority, and we continue to innovate and invest in a high bar for security and compliance across all global operations. Our industry-leading functionality provides the foundation for our long list of internationally-recognized certifications and accreditations, demonstrating compliance with rigorous international standards, such as ISO 27001 for technical measures, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/iso-27017-faqs/">ISO 27017</a> for cloud security, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/iso-27018-faqs/">ISO 27018</a> for cloud privacy, SOC 1, SOC 2 and SOC 3, PCI DSS Level 1, and EU-specific certifications such as BSI’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/bsi-c5/">Common Cloud Computing Controls Catalogue</a> (C5). AWS continues to pursue the certifications that assist our customers.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Compliance-enabling Services</strong></span><br /> Many requirements under the GDPR focus on ensuring effective control and protection of personal data. AWS services give you the capability to implement your own security measures in the ways you need in order to enable your compliance with the GDPR, including specific measures such as:</p> 
<li>Encryption of personal data</li> 
<li>Ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services</li> 
<li>Ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident</li> 
<li>Processes for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of processing</li> 
<p>This is an advanced set of security and compliance services that are designed specifically to handle the requirements of the GDPR. There are numerous AWS services that have particular significance for customers focusing on GDPR compliance, including:</p> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/">Amazon GuardDuty</a> – a security service featuring intelligent threat detection and continuous monitoring</li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/macie/">Amazon Macie</a> – a machine learning tool to assist discovery and securing of personal data stored in Amazon S3</li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/">Amazon Inspector</a> – an automated security assessment service to help keep applications in conformity with best security practices</li> 
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html">AWS Config Rules</a> – a monitoring service that dynamically checks cloud resources for compliance with security rules</li> 
<p>Additionally, we have published a whitepaper, “<a href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/GDPR_Compliance_on_AWS.pdf">Navigating GDPR Compliance on AWS</a>,” dedicated to this topic. This paper details how to tie GDPR concepts to specific AWS services, including those relating to monitoring, data access, and key management. Furthermore, our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gdpr-center/">GDPR Center</a> will give you access to the up-to-date resources you need to tackle requirements that directly support your GDPR efforts.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Compliant DPA</strong></span><br /> We <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/">offer</a> a GDPR-compliant Data Processing Addendum (DPA), enabling you to comply with GDPR contractual obligations.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Conformity with a Code of Conduct</strong></span><br /> GDPR introduces adherence to a “code of conduct” as a mechanism for demonstrating sufficient guarantees of requirements that the GDPR places on data processors. In this context, we previously announced compliance with the CISPE Code of Conduct. The CISPE Code of Conduct provides customers with additional assurances regarding their ability to fully control their data in a safe, secure, and compliant environment when they use services from providers like AWS. More detail about the CISPE Code of Conduct can be found at: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/cispe/">https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/cispe/</a></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Training and Summits</strong></span><br /> We can provide you with training on navigating GDPR compliance using AWS services via our Professional Services team. This team has a GDPR workshop offering, which is a two-day facilitated session customized to your specific needs and challenges. We are also providing GDPR presentations during our AWS Summits in European countries, as well as San Francisco and Tokyo.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Additional Resources</strong></span><br /> Finally, we have teams of compliance, data protection, and security experts, as well as the APN, helping customers across Europe prepare for running regulated workloads in the cloud as the GDPR becomes enforceable. For additional information on this, please contact your AWS Account Manager.</p> 
<p>As we move towards May 25 and beyond, we’ll be posting a series of blogs to dive deeper into GDPR-related concepts along with how AWS can help. Please visit our <strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gdpr-center/">GDPR Center</a></strong>&nbsp;for more information. We’re excited about being your partner in fully addressing this important regulation.</p>

<p>AWS Key Management Service (KMS) now uses FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security modules (HSM) and supports FIPS 140-2 validated endpoints, which provide independent assurances about the confidentiality and integrity of your keys. Having additional third-party assurances about the keys you manage in AWS KMS can make it easier to use the service for regulated workloads.</p> 
<p>The process of gaining FIPS 140-2 validation is rigorous. First, AWS KMS HSMs were tested by an independent lab; those results were further reviewed by the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Module-Validation-Program" title="undefined" target="_blank">Cryptographic Module Validation Program</a> run by NIST. You can view the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/Certificate/3139" title="undefined" target="_blank">FIPS 140-2 certificate of the AWS Key Management Service HSM</a> to get more details.</p> 
<p>AWS KMS HSMs are designed so that no one, not even AWS employees, can retrieve your plaintext keys. The service uses the FIPS 140-2 validated HSMs to protect your keys when you request the service to create keys on your behalf or when you import them. Your plaintext keys are never written to disk and are only used in volatile memory of the HSMs while performing your requested cryptographic operation. Furthermore, AWS KMS keys are never transmitted outside the AWS Regions they were created. And HSM firmware updates are controlled by multi-party access that is audited and reviewed by an independent group within AWS. </p> 
<p>AWS KMS HSMs are validated at level 2 overall and at level 3 in the following areas:</p> 
<li>Cryptographic Module Specification</li> 
<li>Roles, Services, and Authentication</li> 
<li>Physical Security</li> 
<li>Design Assurance</li> 
<p>You can also make AWS KMS requests to API endpoints that terminate TLS sessions using a FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic software module. To do so, connect to the unique <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#kms_region" title="undefined" target="_blank">FIPS 140-2 validated HTTPS endpoints</a> in the AWS KMS requests made from your applications. AWS KMS FIPS 140-2 validated HTTPS endpoints are powered by the <a href="https://www.openssl.org/docs/fips/SecurityPolicy-2.0.13.pdf" title="undefined" target="_blank">OpenSSL FIPS Object Module</a>. FIPS 140-2 validated API endpoints are available in all commercial regions where AWS KMS is available.</p>

<p>We’re relentlessly innovating on your behalf at AWS, especially when it comes to security. Last November, we launched Amazon GuardDuty, a continuous security monitoring and threat detection service that incorporates threat intelligence, anomaly detection, and machine learning to help protect your AWS resources, including your AWS accounts. Many large customers, including <a title="undefined" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171128006613/en/AWS-Announces-Amazon-GuardDuty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">General Electric, Autodesk, and MapBox</a>, discovered these benefits and have quickly adopted the service for its ease of use and improved threat detection. In this post, I want to show you how easy it is for everyone to get started—large and small—and discuss our rapid iteration on the service.</p> 
<p>After more than seven years at AWS, I still find myself staying up at night obsessing about unnecessary complexity. Sounds fun, right? Well, I don’t have to tell you that there’s a lot of unnecessary complexity and undifferentiated heavy lifting in security. Most security tooling requires significant care and feeding by humans. It’s often difficult to configure and manage, it’s hard to know if it’s working properly, and it’s costly to procure and run. As a result, it’s not accessible to all customers, and for those that do get their hands on it, they spend a lot of highly-skilled resources trying to keep it operating at its potential.</p> 
<p>Even for the most skilled security teams, it can be a struggle to ensure that all resources are covered, especially in the age of virtualization, where new accounts, new resources, and new users can come and go across your organization at a rapid pace. Furthermore, attackers have come up with ingenious ways of giving you the impression your security solution is working when, in fact, it has been completely disabled.</p> 
<p>I’ve spent a lot of time obsessing about these problems. How can we use the Cloud to not just innovate in security, but also make it easier, more affordable, and more accessible to all? Our ultimate goal is to help you better protect your AWS resources, while also freeing you up to focus on the next big project.</p> 
<p>With GuardDuty, we really turned the screws on unnecessary complexity, distilling continuous security monitoring and threat detection down to a binary decision—it’s either on or off. That’s it. There’s no software, virtual appliances, or agents to deploy, no data sources to enable, and no complex permissions to create. You don’t have to write custom rules or become an expert at machine learning. All we ask of you is to simply turn the service on with a single-click or API call.</p> 
<p>GuardDuty operates completely on our infrastructure, so there’s no risk of disrupting your workloads. By providing a hard hypervisor boundary between the code running in your AWS accounts and the code running in GuardDuty, we can help ensure full coverage while making it harder for a misconfiguration or an ingenious attacker to change that. When we detect something interesting, we generate a security finding and deliver it to you through the GuardDuty console and AWS CloudWatch Events. This makes it possible to simply view findings in GuardDuty or push them to an existing SIEM or workflow system. We’ve already seen customers take it a step further using AWS Lambda to automate actions such as changing security groups, isolating instances, or rotating credentials.</p> 
<p>Now… are you ready to get started? It’s this simple:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d1.awsstatic.com/security-center/SecurityBlog/guard_duty_enable_1.aaab2e0d1fc629e4aa6956d0bc127555e82c74ae.png" /></p> 
<b>So, you’ve got it enabled, now what can GuardDuty detect?</b> 
<p>As soon as you enable the service, it immediately starts consuming multiple metadata streams at scale, including AWS CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs. It compares what it finds to fully managed threat intelligence feeds containing the latest malicious IPs and domains. In parallel, GuardDuty profiles all activity in your account, which allows it to learn the behavior of your resources so it can identify highly suspicious activity that suggests a threat.</p> 
<p>The threat-intelligence-based detections can identify activity such as an EC2 instance being probed or brute-forced by an attacker. If an instance is compromised, it can detect attempts at lateral movement, communication with a known malware or command-and-control server, crypto-currency mining, or an attempt to exfiltrate data through DNS.</p> 
<p>Where it gets more interesting is the ability to detect AWS account-focused threats. For example, if an attacker gets a hold of your AWS account credentials—say, one of your developers exposes credentials on GitHub—GuardDuty will identify unusual account behavior. For example, an unusual instance type being deployed in a region that has never been used, suspicious attempts to inventory your resources by calling unusual patterns of list APIs or describe APIs, or an effort to obscure user activity by disabling CloudTrail logging.</p> 
<p>Our obsession with removing complexity meant making these detections fully-managed. We take on all the heavy lifting of building, maintaining, measuring, and improving the detections so that you can focus on what to do when an event does occur.</p> 
<b>What’s new?</b> 
<p>When we launched at the end of November, we had thirty-four distinct detections in GuardDuty, but we weren’t stopping there. Many of these detections are already on their second or third continuous improvement iteration. In less than three months, we’ve also added twelve more, including nine CloudTrail-based anomaly detections that identify highly suspicious activity in your accounts. These new detections intelligently catch changes to, or reconnaissance of, network, resource, user permissions, and anomalous activity in EC2, CloudTrail, and AWS console log-ins. These are detections we’ve built based on what we’ve learned from observed attack patterns across the scale of AWS.</p> 
<p>The intelligence in these detections is built around the identification of <strong>highly sensitive</strong> AWS API calls that are invoked under one or more <strong>highly suspicious</strong> circumstances. The combination of “highly sensitive” and “highly suspicious” is important. Highly sensitive APIs are those that either change the security posture of an account by adding or elevating users, user policies, roles, or account-key IDs (AKIDs). Highly suspicious circumstances are determined from underlying models profiled at the API level by GuardDuty. The result is the ability to catch real threats, while decreasing false positives, limiting false negatives, and reducing alert-noise.</p> 
<b>It’s still day one</b> 
<p>As we like to say in Amazon, it’s still day one. I’m excited about what we’ve built with GuardDuty, but we’re not going to stop improving, even if you’re already happy with what we’ve built. Check out the list of new detections below and all of the <a title="undefined" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GuardDuty detections in our online documentation</a>. Keep the feedback coming as it’s what powers us at AWS.</p> 
<p>Now, I have to stop writing because my wife tells me I have some unnecessary complexity to remove from our closet.</p> 
<b>New GuardDuty CloudTrail-based anomaly detections</b> 
<ol> 
<li><strong>Recon:IAMUser/NetworkPermissions</strong><br /> <strong>Situation</strong>: An IAM user invoked an API commonly used to discover the network access permissions of existing security groups, ACLs, and routes in your AWS account.<br /> <strong>Description</strong>: This finding is triggered when network configuration settings in your AWS environment are probed under suspicious circumstances. For example, if an IAM user in your AWS environment invoked the DescribeSecurityGroups API with no prior history of doing so. An attacker might use stolen credentials to perform this reconnaissance of network configuration settings before executing the next stage of their attack, which might include changing network permissions or making use of existing openings in the network configuration.<br /> &nbsp;</li> 
<li><strong>Recon:IAMUser/ResourcePermissions</strong><br /> <strong>Situation</strong>: An IAM user invoked an API commonly used to discover the permissions associated with various resources in your AWS account.<br /> <strong>Description</strong>: This finding is triggered when resource access permissions in your AWS account are probed under suspicious circumstances. For example, if an IAM user with no prior history of doing so, invoked the DescribeInstances API. An attacker might use stolen credentials to perform this reconnaissance of your AWS resources in order to find valuable information or determine the capabilities of the credentials they already have.<br /> &nbsp;</li> 
<li><strong>Recon:IAMUser/UserPermissions</strong><br /> <strong>Situation</strong>: An IAM user invoked an API commonly used to discover the users, groups, policies, and permissions in your AWS account.<br /> <strong>Description</strong>: This finding is triggered when user permissions in your AWS environment are probed under suspicious circumstances. For example, if an IAM user invoked the ListInstanceProfilesForRole API with no prior history of doing so. An attacker might use stolen credentials to perform this reconnaissance of your IAM users and roles to determine the capabilities of the credentials they already have or to find more permissive credentials that are vulnerable to lateral movement.<br /> &nbsp;</li> 
<li><strong>Persistence:IAMUser/NetworkPermissions</strong><br /> <strong>Situation</strong>: An IAM user invoked an API commonly used to change the network access permissions for security groups, routes, and ACLs in your AWS account.<br /> <strong>Description</strong>: This finding is triggered when network configuration settings are changed under suspicious circumstances. For example, if an IAM user in your AWS environment invoked the CreateSecurityGroup API with no prior history of doing so. Attackers often attempt to change security groups, allowing certain inbound traffic on various ports to improve their ability to access the bot they might have planted on your EC2 instance.<br /> &nbsp;</li> 
<li><strong>Persistence:IAMUser/ResourcePermissions</strong><br /> <strong>Situation</strong>: An IAM user invoked an API commonly used to change the security access policies of various resources in your AWS account.<br /> <strong>Description</strong>: This finding is triggered when a change is detected to policies or permissions attached to AWS resources. For example, if an IAM user in your AWS environment invoked the PutBucketPolicy API with no prior history of doing so. Some services, such as Amazon S3, support resource-attached permissions that grant one or more IAM principals access to the resource. With stolen credentials, attackers can change the policies attached to a resource, granting themselves future access to that resource.<br /> &nbsp;</li> 
<li><strong>Persistence:IAMUser/UserPermissions</strong><br /> <strong>Situation</strong>: An IAM user invoked an API commonly used to add, modify, or delete IAM users, groups, or policies in your AWS account.<br /> <strong>Description</strong>: This finding is triggered by suspicious changes to the user-related permissions in your AWS environment. For example, if an IAM user in your AWS environment invoked the AttachUserPolicy API with no prior history of doing so. In an effort to maximize their ability to access the account even after they’ve been discovered, attackers can use stolen credentials to create new users, add access policies to existing users, create access keys, and so on. The owner of the account might notice that a particular IAM user or password was stolen and delete it from the account, but might not delete other users that were created by the fraudulently created admin IAM user, leaving their AWS account still accessible to the attacker.<br /> &nbsp;</li> 
<li><strong>ResourceConsumption:IAMUser/ComputeResources</strong><br /> <strong>Situation</strong>: An IAM user invoked an API commonly used to launch compute resources like EC2 Instances.<br /> <strong>Description</strong>: This finding is triggered when EC2 instances in your AWS environment are launched under suspicious circumstances. For example, if an IAM user invoked the RunInstances API with no prior history of doing so. This might be an indication of an attacker using stolen credentials to access compute time (possibly for cryptocurrency mining or password cracking). It can also be an indication of an attacker using an EC2 instance in your AWS environment and its credentials to maintain access to your account.<br /> &nbsp;</li> 
<li><strong>Stealth:IAMUser/LoggingConfigurationModified</strong><br /> <strong>Situation</strong>: An IAM user invoked an API commonly used to stop CloudTrail logging, delete existing logs, and otherwise eliminate traces of activity in your AWS account.<br /> <strong>Description</strong>: This finding is triggered when the logging configuration in your AWS account is modified under suspicious circumstances. For example, if an IAM user invoked the StopLogging API with no prior history of doing so. This can be an indication of an attacker trying to cover their tracks by eliminating any trace of their activity.<br /> &nbsp;</li> 
<li><strong>UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/ConsoleLogin</strong><br /> <strong>Situation</strong>: An unusual console login by an IAM user in your AWS account was observed.<br /> <strong>Description</strong>: This finding is triggered when a console login is detected under suspicious circumstances. For example, if an IAM user invoked the ConsoleLogin API from a never-before- used client or an unusual location. This could be an indication of stolen credentials being used to gain access to your AWS account, or a valid user accessing the account in an invalid or less secure manner (for example, not over an approved VPN).</li>

<p>You can now enable your on-premises users administer your <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory</a>, also known as AWS Managed Microsoft AD. Using an <a title="undefined" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/setup_trust.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active Directory (AD) trust</a> and the new AWS delegated AD security groups, you can grant administrative permissions to your on-premises users by managing group membership in your on-premises AD directory. This simplifies how you manage who can perform administration. It also makes it easier for your administrators because they can sign in to their existing workstation with their on-premises AD credential to administer your AWS Managed Microsoft AD.</p> 
<p>AWS created new domain local AD security groups (AWS delegated groups) in your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory. Each AWS delegated group has unique AD administrative permissions. Users that are members in the new AWS delegated groups get permissions to perform administrative tasks, such as <a title="undefined" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/creating_ad_users_and_groups.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add users</a>, <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-configure-even-stronger-password-policies-to-help-meet-your-security-standards-by-using-aws-directory-service-for-microsoft-active-directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">configure fine-grained password policies</a> and <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-enable-ldaps-for-your-aws-microsoft-ad-directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enable Microsoft enterprise Certificate Authority</a>. Because the AWS delegated groups are domain local in scope, you can use them through an AD Trust to your on-premises AD. This eliminates the requirement to create and use separate identities to administer your AWS Managed Microsoft AD. Instead, by adding selected on-premises users to desired AWS delegated groups, you can grant your administrators some or all of the permissions. You can simplify this even further by adding on-premises AD security groups to the AWS delegated groups. This enables you to add and remove users from your on-premises AD security group so that they can manage administrative permissions in your AWS Managed Microsoft AD.</p> 
<p>In this blog post, I will show you how to delegate permissions to your on-premises users to perform an administrative task–configuring fine-grained password policies–in your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory. You can follow the steps in this post to delegate other administrative permissions, such as configuring <a title="undefined" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/admin_permissions.html#gmsa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">group Managed Service Accounts</a> and <a title="undefined" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/admin_permissions.html#kcd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kerberos constrained delegation</a>, to your on-premises users.</p> 
<b>Background</b> 
<p>Until now, AWS Managed Microsoft AD delegated administrative permissions for your directory by creating AD security groups in your <a title="undefined" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/admin_permissions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Organization Unit</a> (OU) and authorizing these <a title="undefined" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/create_details_managed.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS delegated groups</a> for <a title="undefined" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/admin_permissions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">common administrative activities</a>. The <a title="undefined" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/admin_permissions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">admin user</a> in your directory created user accounts within your OU, and granted these users permissions to administer your directory by adding them to one or more of these AWS delegated groups.</p> 
<p>However, if you used your AWS Managed Microsoft AD with a <a title="undefined" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/setup_trust.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trust</a> to an on-premises AD forest, you couldn’t add users from your on-premises directory to these AWS delegated groups. This is because AWS created the AWS delegated groups with <a title="undefined" href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755692(v=ws.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">global</a> scope, which restricts adding users from another forest. This necessitated that you create different user accounts in AWS Managed Microsoft AD for the purpose of administration. As a result, AD administrators typically had to remember additional credentials for AWS Managed Microsoft AD.</p> 
<p>To address this, AWS created new AWS delegated groups with <a title="undefined" href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755692(v=ws.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">domain local</a> scope in a separate OU called AWS Delegated Groups. These new AWS delegated groups with domain local scope are more flexible and permit adding users and groups from other domains and forests. This allows your admin user to delegate your on-premises users and groups administrative permissions to your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Note: If you already have an existing AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory containing the original AWS delegated groups with global scope, AWS preserved the original AWS delegated groups in the event you are currently using them with identities in AWS Managed Microsoft AD. AWS recommends that you transition to use the new AWS delegated groups with domain local scope. All newly created AWS Managed Microsoft AD directories have the new AWS delegated groups with domain local scope only.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Now, I will show you the steps to delegate administrative permissions to your on-premises users and groups to configure fine-grained password policies in your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory.</p> 
<b>Prerequisites</b> 
<p>For this post, I assume you are familiar with <a title="undefined" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn579255(v=ws.11)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AD security groups</a> and how security group scope rules work. I also assume you are familiar with <a title="undefined" href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc977993.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AD trusts</a>.</p> 
<p>The instructions in this blog post require you to have the following components running:</p> 
<li><strong>An active AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory</strong>. To create a directory, follow the steps in <a title="undefined" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/create_directory.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creating an AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory</a>. You also need to know the password for the <code>admin</code> account so that you can add other users and groups to the AWS created AD security groups in the AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory.</li> 
<li><strong>An existing on-premises AD directory</strong>. Your on-premises AD directory must contain a user that you want to delegate permissions to manage your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory.</li> 
<li><strong>A trust relationship between your AWS Managed Microsoft AD and your on-premises AD</strong>. To learn more, see <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/now-available-simplified-configuration-of-trust-relationships-in-the-aws-directory-service-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simplified Configuration of Trust Relationship in the AWS Directory Service Console</a>. You can create a one-way outgoing trust from your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory to your on-premises AD directory, or a two-way trust.</li> 
<li><strong>A machine joined to AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain with Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) tool installed</strong>. If you don’t have an existing machine with ADUC installed, you can <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/seamlessly-join-ec2-instances-to-a-domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join an Amazon EC2 for Windows Server instance to your AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain</a> and install <a title="undefined" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/install_ad_tools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active Directory Administrative Tools</a>.</li> 
<li><strong>A machine joined to your on-premises AD directory with ADUC installed</strong>. You can install ADUC by installing <a title="undefined" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/install_ad_tools.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active Directory Administrative Tools</a> on a Windows computer that you joined to your on-premises AD domain.</li> 
<b>Solution overview</b> 
<p>I will now show you how to manage which on-premises users have delegated permissions to administer your directory by efficiently using on-premises AD security groups to manage these permissions. I will do this by:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Adding on-premises groups to an AWS delegated group. In this step, you sign in to management instance connected to AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory as <code>admin</code> user and add on-premises groups to AWS delegated groups.</li> 
<li>Administer your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory as on-premises user. In this step, you sign in to a workstation connected to your on-premises AD using your on-premises credentials and administer your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>For the purpose of this blog, I already have an on-premises AD directory (in this case, <code>on-premises.com</code>). I also created an AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory (in this case, <code>corp.example.com</code>) that I use with <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon RDS for SQL Server</a>. To enable <a title="undefined" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Windows_Authentication" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Integrated Windows Authentication</a> to my <code>on-premises.com</code> domain, I established a one-way outgoing trust from my AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory to my on-premises AD directory. To administer my AWS Managed Microsoft AD, I created an Amazon EC2 for Windows Server instance (in this case, <code>Cloud Management</code>). I also have an on-premises workstation (in this case, <code>On-premises Management</code>), that is connected to my on-premises AD directory.</p> 
<p>The following diagram represents the relationships between the on-premises AD and the AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory.</p> 
<p>The left side represents the AWS Cloud containing AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory. I connected the directory to the on-premises AD directory via a 1-way forest trust relationship. When AWS created my AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory, AWS created a group called <code>AWS Delegated Fine Grained Password Policy Administrators</code> that has permissions to configure fine-grained password policies in AWS Managed Microsoft AD.</p> 
<p>The right side of the diagram represents the on-premises AD directory. I created a global AD security group called <code>On-premises fine grained password policy admins</code> and I configured it so all members can manage fine grained password policies in my on-premises AD. I have two administrators in my company, <code>John</code> and <code>Richard</code>, who I added as members of <code>On-premises fine grained password policy admins</code>. I want to enable <code>John</code> and <code>Richard</code> to also manage fine grained password policies in my AWS Managed Microsoft AD.</p> 
<p>While I could add <code>John</code> and <code>Richard</code> to the <code>AWS Delegated Fine Grained Password Policy Administrators</code> individually, I want a more efficient way to delegate and remove permissions for on-premises users to manage fine grained password policies in my AWS Managed Microsoft AD. In fact, I want to assign permissions to the same people that manage password policies in my on-premises directory.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/03/06/Vijay-Sharma-01.png" /></p> 
<p>To do this, I will:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>As <code>admin</code> user, add the <code>On-premises fine grained password policy admins</code> as member of the <code>AWS Delegated Fine Grained Password Policy Administrators</code> security group from my <code>Cloud Management</code> machine.</li> 
<li>Manage who can administer password policies in my AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory by adding and removing users as members of the <code>On-premises fine grained password policy admins</code>. Doing so enables me to perform all my delegation work in my on-premises directory without the need to use a remote desktop protocol (RDP) session to my <code>Cloud Management</code> instance. In this case, <code>Richard</code>, who is a member of <code>On-premises fine grained password policy admins</code> group can now administer AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory from <code>On-premises Management</code> workstation.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Although I’m showing a specific case using fine grained password policy delegation, you can do this with any of the new AWS delegated groups and your on-premises groups and users.</p> 
<p>Let’s get started.</p> 
<b>Step 1 – Add on-premises groups to AWS delegated groups</b> 
<p>In this step, open an RDP session to the Cloud Management instance and sign in as the admin user in your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory. Then, add your users and groups from your on-premises AD to AWS delegated groups in AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory. In this example, I do the following:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Sign in to the <code>Cloud Management</code> instance with the user name <code>admin</code> and the password that you set for the <code>admin</code> user when you created your directory.</li> 
<li>Open the <strong>Microsoft Windows Server Manager</strong> and navigate to <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Active Directory Users and Computers</strong>.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/03/06/Vijay-Sharma-Step-1-02-300x150.png" /></li> 
<li>Switch to the tree view and navigate to <strong>corp.example.com</strong> &gt; <strong>AWS Delegated Groups</strong>. Right-click <strong>AWS Delegated Fine Grained Password Policy Administrators</strong> and select <strong>Properties</strong>.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/03/06/Vijay-Sharma-Step-1-03-300x127.png" /></li> 
<li>In the <strong>AWS Delegated Fine Grained Password Policy</strong> window, switch to <strong>Members</strong> tab and choose <strong>Add</strong>.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/03/06/Vijay-Sharma-Step-1-04-269x300.png" /></li> 
<li>In the <strong>Select Users, Contacts, Computers, Service Accounts, or Groups</strong> window, choose <strong>Locations</strong>.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/03/06/Vijay-Sharma-Step-1-05-300x165.png" /></li> 
<li>In the <strong>Locations</strong> window, select <strong>on-premises.com domain</strong> and choose <strong>OK</strong>.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/03/06/Vijay-Sharma-Step-1-06-300x174.png" /></li> 
<li>In the <strong>Enter the object names to select</strong> box, enter <code>on-premises fine grained password policy admins</code> and choose <strong>Check Names</strong>.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/03/06/Vijay-Sharma-Step-1-07-300x165.png" /></li> 
<li>Because I have a 1-way trust from AWS Managed Microsoft AD to my on-premises AD, Windows prompts me to enter credentials for an on-premises user account that has permissions to complete the search. If I had a 2-way trust and the admin account in my AWS Managed Microsoft AD has permissions to read my on-premises directory, Windows will not prompt me.In the <strong>Windows Security</strong> window, enter the credentials for an account with permissions for <code>on-premises.com</code> and choose <strong>OK</strong>.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/03/06/Vijay-Sharma-Step-1-08-300x280.png" /></li> 
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to add <code>On-premises fine grained password policy admins</code> group as a member of the <code>AWS Delegated Fine Grained Password Policy Administrators</code> group in your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/03/06/Vijay-Sharma-Step-1-09-300x165.png" /></li> 
</ol> 
<p>At this point, any user that is a member of <code>On-premises fine grained password policy admins</code> group has permissions to manage password policies in your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory.</p> 
<b>Step 2 – Administer your AWS Managed Microsoft AD as on-premises user</b> 
<p>Any member of the on-premises group(s) that you added to an AWS delegated group inherited the permissions of the AWS delegated group.</p> 
<p>In this example, <code>Richard</code> signs in to the <code>On-premises Management</code> instance. Because <code>Richard</code> inherited permissions from <code>Delegated Fine Grained Password Policy Administrators</code>, he can now administer fine grained password policies in the AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory using on-premises credentials.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Sign in to the <code>On-premises Management</code> instance as <code>Richard</code>.</li> 
<li>Open the <strong>Microsoft Windows Server Manager</strong> and navigate to <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Active Directory Users and Computers</strong>.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/03/06/Vijay-Sharma-Step-2-10-300x150.png" /></li> 
<li>Switch to the tree view, right-click <strong>Active Directory Users and Computers</strong>, and then select <strong>Change Domain</strong>.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/03/06/Vijay-Sharma-Step-2-11-300x167.png" /></li> 
<li>In the <strong>Change Domain</strong> window, enter <code>corp.example.com</code>, and then choose <strong>OK</strong>.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/03/06/Vijay-Sharma-Step-2-12-300x114.png" /></li> 
<li>You’ll be connected to your AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain:<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2018/03/06/Vijay-Sharma-Step-2-13-277x300.png" /></li> 
</ol> 
<p><code>Richard</code> can now administer the password policies. Because <code>John</code> is also a member of the AWS delegated group, <code>John</code> can also perform password policy administration the same way.</p> 
<p>In future, if <code>Richard</code> moves to another division within the company and you hire <code>Judy</code> as a replacement for <code>Richard</code>, you can simply remove <code>Richard</code> from <code>On-premises fine grained password policy admins</code> group and add <code>Judy</code> to this group. <code>Richard</code> will no longer have administrative permissions, while <code>Judy</code> can now administer password policies for your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory.</p> 
<b>Summary</b> 
<p>We’ve tried to make it easier for you to administer your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory by creating AWS delegated groups with domain local scope. You can add your on-premises AD groups to the AWS delegated groups. You can then control who can administer your directory by managing group membership in your on-premises AD directory. Your administrators can sign in to their existing on-premises workstations using their on-premises credentials and administer your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory. I encourage you to explore the new AWS delegated security groups by using Active Directory Users and Computers from the management instance for your AWS Managed Microsoft AD.

<p>As a follow up to our initial region availability on November 20, 2017, I’m happy to announce that we have expanded the number of accredited services available in the AWS Secret Region by an additional 11 services. We continue to be the only cloud service provider with accredited regions to address the full range of U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) data classifications, including Unclassified, Sensitive (CUI), Secret, and Top Secret.</p> 
<p>When the region launched last November, we achieved a Provisional Authorization (PA) for Impact Level 6 (IL6) workloads from the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), the IT combat support organization of the DoD. The PA was recently extended, allowing for continued access to the region for IL6 workloads.</p> 
<p>The AWS Secret Region was designed and built to meet the specific security requirements of secret classified workloads for the DoD and the intelligence community. A service catalog for the region is available through your AWS Account Executive.</p>
