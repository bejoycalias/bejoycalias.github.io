<p>Newly updated reports are available for AWS System and Organization Control Report 1 (SOC 1), formerly called AWS Service Organization Control Report 1, and AWS SOC 2: Security, Availability, &amp; Confidentiality Report. You can download both reports for free and on demand in the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Management Console</a> through <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/artifact/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Artifact</a>. The updated <a href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_SOC3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS SOC 3: Security, Availability, &amp; Confidentiality Report</a> also was just released. All three reports cover April 1, 2017, through September 30, 2017.</p> 
<p>With the addition of the following 19 services, AWS now supports 51 SOC-compliant AWS services and is committed to&nbsp;increasing the number:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Amazon API Gateway</li> 
<li>Amazon Cloud Directory</li> 
<li>Amazon CloudFront</li> 
<li>Amazon Cognito</li> 
<li>Amazon Connect</li> 
<li>AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory</li> 
<li>Amazon EC2 Container Registry</li> 
<li>Amazon EC2 Container Service</li> 
<li>Amazon EC2 Systems Manager</li> 
<li>Amazon Inspector</li> 
<li>AWS IoT Platform</li> 
<li>Amazon Kinesis Streams</li> 
<li>AWS Lambda</li> 
<li>AWS Lambda@Edge</li> 
<li>AWS Managed Services</li> 
<li>Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration</li> 
<li>AWS Shield</li> 
<li>AWS Step Functions</li> 
<li>AWS WAF</li> 
</ul> 
<p>With this release, we also are introducing&nbsp;a separate spreadsheet, eliminating the need to extract the information from multiple PDFs.</p> 
<p>If you are not yet an AWS customer, contact <a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/compliance-contact-us.html">AWS Compliance</a> to access the SOC Reports.</p>

<p>If you want to support Active Directory–aware workloads in AWS and Office 365 simultaneously using a managed Active Directory in the cloud, you need a nonintuitive integration to synchronize identities between deployments. AWS has recently introduced the ability for you to authenticate your Office 365 permissions using AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (AWS Managed Microsoft AD) by using a custom configuration of Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS). In this webinar, AWS Directory Service Product Manager Ron Cully shows how to configure your AWS Managed Microsoft AD environment to synchronize with Office 365. He will provide detailed configuration settings, architectural considerations, and deployment steps for a highly available, secure, and easy-to-manage solution in the AWS Cloud.</p> 
<p>You also will learn how to:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Deploy AWS Managed Microsoft AD.</li> 
<li>Deploy Microsoft Azure AD Connect and AD FS with AWS Managed Microsoft AD.</li> 
<li>Authenticate user access to Office 365 by using AWS Managed Microsoft AD.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>This tech talk is free.&nbsp;<a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/registration_111517_How-to-Integrate-AWS-Directory-Service-with-Office365.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Register today</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon ElastiCache for Redis</a> is now a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HIPAA Eligible Service</a> and has been added to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-compliance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Business Associate Addendum</a> (BAA). This means you can use ElastiCache for Redis to help you power healthcare applications as well as process, maintain, and store protected health information (PHI). ElastiCache for Redis is a Redis-compatible, fully-managed, in-memory data store and cache in the cloud that provides sub-millisecond latency to power applications. Now you can use the speed, simplicity, and flexibility of ElastiCache for Redis to build secure, fast, and internet-scale healthcare applications.</p> 
<p>ElastiCache for Redis with HIPAA eligibility is available for all current-generation instance node types and requires <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/SelectEngine.RedisVersions.html#SelectEngine.RedisVersions.RedisVersions.3-2-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redis engine version 3.2.6</a>. You must ensure that nodes are configured to encrypt the data <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/in-transit-encryption.html#in-transit-encryption-enable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in transit</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/at-rest-encryption.html#at-rest-encryption-enable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at rest</a>, and to authenticate Redis commands before the engine executes them. See&nbsp;<a href="https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_HIPAA_Compliance_Whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Architecting for HIPAA Security and Compliance on Amazon Web Services</a> for information about how to configure Amazon HIPAA Eligible Services to store, process, and transmit PHI.</p> 
<p>ElastiCache for Redis uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advanced Encryption Standard</a> (AES)-512 symmetric keys to encrypt data on disk. The Redis backups stored in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon S3</a> are encrypted with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">server-side encryption</a> (SSE) using AES-256 symmetric keys. ElastiCache for Redis uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transport Layer Security</a> (TLS) to encrypt data in transit. It uses the Redis AUTH token that you provide at the time of Redis cluster creation to authenticate the Redis commands coming from clients. The AUTH token is encrypted using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Key Management Service</a>.</p> 
<p>There is no additional charge for using ElastiCache for Redis clusters with HIPAA eligibility. To get started, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/elasticache-compliance-hipaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HIPAA Compliance for Amazon ElastiCache for Redis</a>.</p>

<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS, formerly called Secure Sockets Layer [SSL]) is essential for encrypting information that is exchanged on the internet. For example, Amazon.com uses TLS for all traffic on its website, and AWS uses it to secure calls to AWS services.</p> 
<p>An electronic document called a <em>certificate</em>&nbsp;verifies the identity of the server when creating such an encrypted connection. The certificate helps establish proof that your web browser is communicating securely with the website that you typed in your browser’s address field. <em>Certificate Authorities</em>, also known as CAs, issue certificates to specific domains. When a domain presents a certificate that is issued by a trusted CA, your browser or application knows it’s safe to make the connection.</p> 
<p>In January 2016, AWS launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/acm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Certificate Manager</a> (ACM), a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy SSL/TLS certificates for use with AWS services. These certificates are available for no additional charge through Amazon’s own CA: <a href="https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Trust Services</a>. For browsers and other applications to trust a certificate, the certificate’s issuer must be included in the browser’s <em>trust store</em>, which is a list of trusted CAs. If the issuing CA is not in the trust store, the browser will display an error message (see an <a href="https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example</a>) and applications will show an application-specific error. To ensure the ubiquity of the Amazon Trust Services CA, AWS purchased the Starfield Services CA, a root found in most browsers and which has been valid since 2005. This means you shouldn’t have to take any action to use the certificates issued by Amazon Trust Services.</p> 
<p>AWS has been offering free certificates to AWS customers from the Amazon Trust Services CA. Now, AWS is in the process of moving certificates for services such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EC2</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon DynamoDB</a> to use certificates from Amazon Trust Services as well. Most software doesn’t need to be changed to handle this transition, but there are exceptions. In this blog post, I show you how to verify that you are prepared to use the Amazon Trust Services CA.</p> 
<h3>How to tell if the Amazon Trust Services CAs are in your trust store</h3> 
<p>The following table lists the Amazon Trust Services certificates. To verify that these certificates are in your browser’s trust store, click each Test URL in the following table to verify that it works for you. When a Test URL does not work, it displays an error similar to <a href="https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this example</a>.<span id="more-5777"></span></p>

<h3>What to do if the Amazon Trust Services CAs are not in your trust store</h3> 
<p>If your tests of any of the Test URLs failed, you must update your trust store. The easiest way to update your trust store is to upgrade the operating system or browser that you are using.</p> 
<p>You will find the Amazon Trust Services CAs in the following operating systems (release dates are in parentheses):</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Microsoft Windows versions that have January 2005 or later updates installed, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and newer versions</li> 
<li>Mac OS X 10.4 with Java for Mac OS X 10.4 Release 5, Mac OS X 10.5 and newer versions</li> 
<li>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (March 2007), Linux 6, and Linux 7 and CentOS 5, CentOS 6, and CentOS 7</li> 
<li>Ubuntu 8.10</li> 
<li>Debian 5.0</li> 
<li>Amazon Linux (all versions)</li> 
<li>Java 1.4.2_12, Java 5 update 2, and all newer versions, including Java 6, Java 7, and Java 8</li> 
</ul> 
<p>All modern browsers trust Amazon’s CAs. You can update the certificate bundle in your browser simply by updating your browser. You can find instructions for updating the following browsers on their respective websites:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome</a></li> 
<li><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/update-firefox-latest-version" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox</a></li> 
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Safari</a></li> 
<li>The Windows operating system manages certificate bundles for <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/which-version-am-i-using#ie=other" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge</a>, so you must update Windows as well.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>If your application is using a custom trust store, you must add the <a href="https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon root CAs</a> to your application’s trust store. The instructions for doing this vary based on the application or platform. Please refer to the documentation for the application or platform you are using.</p> 
<h4>AWS SDKs and CLIs</h4> 
<p>Most&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS SDKs and CLIs</a> are not impacted by the transition to the Amazon Trust Services CA. If you are using a version of the Python AWS SDK or CLI released before February 5, 2015, you&nbsp;must upgrade. The .NET, Java, PHP, Go, JavaScript, and C++ SDKs and CLIs do not bundle any certificates, so their certificates come from the underlying operating system. The Ruby SDK has included at least one of the required CAs since June 10, 2015. Before that date, the Ruby V2 SDK did not bundle certificates.</p> 
<h3>Certificate pinning</h3> 
<p>If you are using a technique called <em>certificate pinning</em> to lock down the CAs you trust on a domain-by-domain basis, you must adjust your pinning to include the Amazon Trust Services CAs. Certificate pinning helps defend you from an attacker&nbsp;using&nbsp;misissued certificates to fool an application into creating a connection to a spoofed host (an illegitimate host masquerading as a legitimate host). The restriction to a specific, pinned certificate is made by checking that the certificate issued is the expected certificate. This is done by checking that the hash of the certificate public key received from the server matches the expected hash stored in the application. If the hashes do not match, the code stops the connection.</p> 
<p>AWS recommends against using certificate pinning because it introduces a potential availability risk. If the certificate to which you pin is replaced, your application will fail to connect. If your use case requires pinning, we&nbsp;recommend that you pin to a CA rather than to an individual certificate. If you are pinning to an Amazon Trust Services CA, you should pin to all&nbsp;CAs shown in the table earlier in this post.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon ElastiCache for Redis</a> now supports encryption for secure internode communications to help keep personally identifiable information (PII) safe. Both encryption in transit and at rest are supported. The new encryption in-transit feature enables you to encrypt all communications between clients and Redis servers as well as between Redis servers (primary and read replica nodes). The encryption at-rest feature allows you to encrypt your ElastiCache for Redis backups on disk and in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon S3</a>. Additionally, you can use the Redis <span style="font-family: courier">AUTH</span> command for an added level of authentication.</p> 
<p>If you are in the Financial Services, Healthcare, and Telecommunications sectors, this new encryption functionality can help you protect your sensitive data sets and meet compliance requirements.

<p>Today, AWS introduced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory</a> (Standard Edition), also known as AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition), which is managed Microsoft Active Directory (AD) that is performance optimized for small and midsize businesses. AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) offers you a highly available and cost-effective primary directory in the AWS Cloud that you can use to manage users, groups, and computers. It enables you to join <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EC2</a> instances to your domain easily and supports many <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS and third-party applications and services</a>. It also can support most of the common use cases of small and midsize businesses. When you use AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) as your primary directory, you can manage access and provide single sign-on (SSO) to cloud applications such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-enable-your-users-to-access-office-365-with-aws-microsoft-active-directory-credentials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Office 365</a>. If you have an existing Microsoft AD directory, you can also use AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) as a resource forest that contains primarily computers and groups, allowing you to migrate your AD-aware applications to the AWS Cloud while using existing on-premises AD credentials.</p> 
<p>In this blog post, I help you get started by answering three main questions about AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition):</p> 
<ol> 
<li>What do I get?</li> 
<li>How can I use it?</li> 
<li>What are the key features?</li> 
</ol> 
<p>After answering these questions, I show how you can get started with creating and using your own AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) directory.<span id="more-5623"></span></p> 
<h3>1. What do I get?</h3> 
<p>When you create an AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) directory, AWS deploys two Microsoft AD domain controllers powered by Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 in your <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a> (VPC). To help deliver high availability, the domain controllers run in different <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Availability Zones</a> in the AWS Region of your choice.</p> 
<p>As a managed service, AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) configures directory replication, automates daily snapshots, and handles all patching and software updates. In addition, AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) monitors and automatically recovers domain controllers in the event of a failure.</p> 
<p>AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) has been optimized as a primary directory for small and midsize businesses with the&nbsp;capacity to support approximately 5,000 employees. With 1 GB of directory object storage, AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) has the capacity to store 30,000 or more total directory objects (users, groups, and computers). AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) also gives you the option to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-increase-the-redundancy-and-performance-of-your-aws-directory-service-for-microsoft-ad-directory-by-adding-domain-controllers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add domain controllers</a> to meet the specific performance demands of your applications. You also can use AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) as a resource forest with a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/tutorial_setup_trust.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trust relationship</a> to your on-premises directory.</p> 
<h3>2. How can I use it?</h3> 
<p>With AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition), you can share a single directory for multiple use cases. For example, you can share a directory to authenticate and authorize access for .NET applications, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon RDS for SQL Server</a> with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_SQLServerWinAuth.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Authentication</a> enabled, and <a href="https://chime.aws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Chime</a> for messaging and video conferencing.</p> 
<p>The following diagram shows some of the use cases for your AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) directory, including the ability to grant your users access to external cloud applications and allow your on-premises AD users to manage and have access to resources in the AWS Cloud. <strong>Click the diagram to see a larger version</strong>.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/10/22/standardedition_usecases_1017_large.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignnone wp-image-5674 size-full" title="Diagram showing some ways you can use AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition)--click the diagram to see a larger version" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/10/22/standardedition_usecases_1017_large.png" alt="Diagram showing some ways you can use AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition)--click the diagram to see a larger version" width="1204" height="732" /></a></p> 
<h4>Use case 1: Sign in to AWS applications and services with AD credentials</h4> 
<p>You can enable multiple AWS applications and services such as the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Management Console</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon WorkSpaces</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon RDS for SQL Server</a> to use your AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) directory. When you enable an AWS application or service in your directory, your users can access the application or service with their AD credentials.</p> 
<p>For example, you can enable your users to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-access-the-aws-management-console-using-aws-microsoft-ad-and-your-on-premises-credentials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign in to the AWS Management Console with their AD credentials</a>. To do this, you enable the AWS Management Console as an application in your directory,&nbsp;and then assign your AD users and groups to IAM roles. When your users sign in to the AWS Management Console, they assume an IAM role to manage AWS resources. This makes it easy for you to grant your users access to the AWS Management Console without&nbsp;needing to configure and manage a separate SAML infrastructure.</p> 
<h4>Use case 2: Manage Amazon EC2 instances</h4> 
<p>Using familiar AD administration tools, you can apply AD Group Policy objects (GPOs) to centrally manage your Amazon EC2 for Windows or Linux instances by <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/join_a_directory.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joining your instances to your AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) domain</a>.</p> 
<p>In addition, your users can sign in to your instances with their AD credentials. This eliminates the need to use individual instance credentials or distribute private key (PEM) files. This makes it easier for you to instantly grant or revoke access to users by using AD user administration tools you already use.</p> 
<h4>Use case 3: Provide directory services to your AD-aware workloads</h4> 
<p>AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) is an actual Microsoft AD that enables you to run traditional AD-aware workloads such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-enable-the-use-of-remote-desktops-by-deploying-microsoft-remote-desktop-licensing-manager-on-aws-microsoft-ad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote Desktop Licensing Manager</a>, <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=4636" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft SharePoint, and Microsoft SQL Server Always On</a> in the AWS Cloud. AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) also helps you to simplify and improve the security of AD-integrated .NET applications by using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/05/simplify-migration-and-improve-security-of-active-directory-integrated-net-applications-by-using-aws-microsoft-ad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs) and Kerberos constrained delegation (KCD).</a></p> 
<h4>Use case 4: SSO to Office 365 and other cloud applications</h4> 
<p>You can use AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) to provide SSO for cloud applications. You can use Azure AD Connect to synchronize your users into Azure AD, and then use Active Directory Federation Services (AD&nbsp;FS) so that your users can access Microsoft Office 365 and other SAML 2.0 cloud applications by using their AD credentials.</p> 
<h4>Use case 5: Extend your on-premises AD to the AWS Cloud</h4> 
<p>If you already have an AD infrastructure and want to use it when migrating AD-aware workloads to the AWS Cloud, AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) can help. You can use AD trusts to connect AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) to your existing AD. This means your users can access AD-aware and AWS applications with their on-premises AD credentials, without needing you to synchronize users, groups, or passwords.</p> 
<p>For example, your users can sign in to the AWS Management Console and Amazon WorkSpaces by using their existing AD user names and passwords. Also, when you use AD-aware applications such as SharePoint with AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition), your logged-in Windows users can access these applications without needing to enter credentials again.</p> 
<h3>3. What are the key features?</h3> 
<p>AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) includes the features detailed in this section.</p> 
<h4>Extend your AD schema</h4> 
<p>With AWS Microsoft AD, you can run customized AD-integrated applications that require changes to your directory schema, which defines the structures of your directory. The schema is composed of object classes such as user objects, which contain attributes such as user names. AWS Microsoft AD lets you extend the schema by adding new AD attributes or object classes that are not present in the core AD attributes and classes.</p> 
<p>For example, if you have a human resources application that uses employee badge color to assign specific benefits, you can extend the schema to include a badge color attribute in the user object class of your directory. To learn more, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-add-more-application-support-to-your-microsoft-ad-directory-by-extending-the-schema/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Move More Custom Applications to the AWS Cloud with AWS Directory Service</a>.</p> 
<h4>Create user-specific password policies</h4> 
<p>With user-specific password policies, you can apply specific restrictions and account lockout policies to different types of users in your AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) domain. For example, you can enforce strong passwords and frequent password change policies for administrators, and use less-restrictive policies with moderate account lockout policies for general users.</p> 
<h4>Add domain controllers</h4> 
<p>You can increase the performance and redundancy of your directory by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-increase-the-redundancy-and-performance-of-your-aws-directory-service-for-microsoft-ad-directory-by-adding-domain-controllers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adding domain controllers</a>. This can help improve application performance by enabling directory clients to load-balance their requests across a larger number of domain controllers.</p> 
<h4>Encrypt directory traffic</h4> 
<p>You can use AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) to encrypt Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) communication between your applications and your directory. By enabling LDAP over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS), also called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-enable-ldaps-for-your-aws-microsoft-ad-directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LDAPS</a>, you encrypt your LDAP communications end to end. This helps you to protect sensitive information you keep in your directory when it is accessed over untrusted networks.</p> 
<h4>Improve the security of signing&nbsp;in to AWS services by using multi-factor authentication (MFA)</h4> 
<p>You can improve the security of signing in to AWS services, such as Amazon WorkSpaces and Amazon QuickSight, by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-enable-multi-factor-authentication-for-amazon-workspaces-and-amazon-quicksight-by-using-microsoft-ad-and-on-premises-credentials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enabling MFA in your AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) directory</a>. With MFA, your users must enter a one-time passcode (OTP) in addition to their AD user names and passwords to access AWS applications and services you enable in AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition).</p> 
<h3>Get started</h3> 
<p>To get started, use the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Directory Service console</a> to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/create_directory.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create your first directory</a> with just a few clicks. If you have not used Directory Service before, you may be eligible for a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30-day limited free trial</a>.</p> 
<h3>Summary</h3> 
<p>In this blog post, I explained what AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) is and how you can use it. With a single directory, you can address many use cases for your business, making it easier to migrate and run your AD-aware workloads in the AWS Cloud, provide access to AWS applications and services, and connect to other cloud applications. To learn more about AWS Microsoft AD, see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Directory Service home page</a>.</p>
