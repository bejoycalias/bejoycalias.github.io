<p><em>By Areg Alimian, Senior Director of Product Management at Ixia</em></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/03/Migration-300x150.jpg" />I am fortunate to have the opportunity to learn from and work with dozens of enterprise IT professionals and executives as they plan to migrate applications and web services to the AWS Cloud.</p> 
<p>As the move towards cloud accelerates, unsubstantiated fears about security are inhibiting the use of cloud services by some enterprises. A vital element of a successful cloud migration is understanding shared responsibilities between the organization and cloud service provider.&nbsp;In fact, Gartner predicts that, through 2020, 95 percent of cloud security failures will be the customer’s fault.*</p> 
<p>The security and monitoring tools offered by cloud providers include support for networking, database, storage, compute, and availability zones. However, analysis of customer packet data, which is critical for network security, is the customer’s responsibility.</p> 
<p>Other customer responsibilities outlined in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/">Shared Responsibility Model</a>&nbsp;include platform, application, identity and access management, operating system, network and firewall configuration, and the protection of data&nbsp;at rest and data in motion.</p> 
<b>Migration Strategies and Security</b> 
<p>There are multiple strategies for cloud migration—re-architecting for the cloud, building cloud-native, re-hosting (lift-and-shift), or re-platforming. Stephen Orban, who heads up enterprise strategy at Amazon Web Services (AWS), does a terrific job explaining trade-offs in his Medium post <a href="https://medium.com/aws-enterprise-collection/6-strategies-for-migrating-applications-to-the-cloud-eb4e85c412b4">6 Strategies for Migrating Applications to the Cloud</a>.</p> 
<p>Regardless of&nbsp;the approach, a successful migration depends on the security of your cloud environment, as well as application performance and fault tolerance, ease of use, cost, and the availability of vendor solutions for security analytics, applications, or network performance management.</p> 
<p>To support a distributed application architecture built to leverage the cloud’s full capabilities, there are several critical requirements for successful visibility and controls designed to provide security—capturing and filtering traffic, and allowing for horizontal scaling while providing pervasive data to tools.</p> 
<h3>Requirement 1: Access to Packet Data</h3> 
<p>In a traditional data center, there is physical access to the network so physical taps and network packet brokers can be used to access and filter data. In the cloud, however, the physical infrastructure is the responsibility of the service provider. Cloud-based applications are generally built as a collection of services that decouple the data from the application and are modeled to scale by spinning up additional instances and leveraging a pool of shared resources, when needed. This&nbsp;means control to the network domain is limited.</p> 
<p>A key customer requirement for moving workloads to the cloud is the need to employ independent, application-level monitoring and analytics of workload behavior. But the tools available to monitor the performance of your environment are virtual private cloud (VPC) flow logs or application metadata, both of which address some needs but do not provide the level of visibility that packet data does for complete clarity.<br /> <br /> </p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/03/MigStratSec.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 1 – A key customer requirement for moving workloads to the cloud is the need to employ independent, application-level monitoring and analytics of workload behavior. </em></p> 
<br /> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Requirement 2: Ability to Handle Complexity</h3> 
<p>Many organizations run tens of thousands of instances in the cloud. Often, these are logically separated into different VPCs, using metadata tags. Different departments or teams within an organization can build their own VPCs, leading to monitoring challenges. For example, it’s possible, even likely, there will be overlapping IP addresses in different VPCs. Managing thousands of instances and the amount of traffic this creates, while dealing with potential IP address overlap, must be considered in a cloud visibility architecture.</p> 
<h3>Requirement 3: Elastic Scale On-Demand</h3> 
<p>A well-architected cloud workload is designed to auto-scale to meet peak demand and contract when demand subsides. As applications scale to meet demand, new instances are created and destroyed dynamically. To be effective, a cloud visibility solution should accommodate the dynamic nature of events, without requiring manual VPC architecture changes or significantly modifying security group policies.</p> 
<h3>Requirement 4: Secure and High Availability Monitoring</h3> 
<p>To best expose native security capabilities of AWS, a visibility solution needs to integrate with the parameters available. One way to do this is to have visibility tools sit within the same VPC as workload instances. A key consideration for secure monitoring is ensuring that security policies configured for your workload and monitoring tool instances are applied to your AWS Cloud visibility.</p> 
<p>If cloud visibility management components are in a separate VPC, like when using a virtual machine, you would have to configure and manage the security of that environment separately, leaving room for error. If that visibility node goes down, all the traffic being monitored and delivered to tools will go missing. This results in missing critical security events or indicators of compromise/breach.</p> 
<h3>Requirement 5: Cost-Effective Solutions</h3> 
<p>Organizations migrate and adopt cloud services for many reasons, including cost-effectiveness. It is counterproductive to guess and size visibility for peak demand. A solution for cloud visibility should work like the cloud itself—pay-per-use and cost-effective. A non-cloud-native approach to visibility creates substantial incremental costs, including complexity costs in deploying, operating, and managing, ensuring uptime, and the potential lack of security capability. Each of theses requirements add to the total cost of ownership.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Ixia&amp;id=001E000000UfZpqIAF">Ixia</a>, a Keysight business, is an AWS Advanced Technology Partner that holds the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/networking/partner-solutions/" title="undefined" target="null">AWS Networking Competency</a>.&nbsp;We have built <a href="https://www.ixiacom.com/products/cloudlens">CloudLens</a> to address cloud visibility with a cloud-native solution that is designed from the ground up to retain the cloud’s elastic scale, flexibility, and agility benefits.</p> 
<p>There are two components of CloudLens&nbsp;that work together to enable visibility in the cloud:</p> 
<li><strong>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) visibility management</strong>. This is where users can configure visibility and define filtering. It is accessible from anywhere and is always available. It has a simple, easy-to-use interface with drag-and drop functionality.</li> 
<li><strong>Sensors and connectors</strong>. Docker containers of software agents deployed within AWS source and tool virtual machine instances. Source instances are where users run their application workloads, and tool instances are where monitoring, analytics, or security forensics tools are deployed. The sensors and connectors are how CloudLens has full access to rich metadata because they sit within end user instances and communicate with each other over a secure VPN tunnel.</li> 
<p>CloudLens addresses the five requirements we started earlier in this post, because it does the following:</p> 
<li><strong>Provides access to packet data</strong>&nbsp;with the sensors that sit in source instances to mirror and filter packet data before forwarding to monitoring instances and tools.</li> 
<li><strong>Addresses complexity</strong> because sensors operate peer-to-peer, over a secure VPN tunnel, so they don’t require an additional VPC or modifications to any existing construct. This makes it easy&nbsp;without any architectural changes.</li> 
<li><strong>Elastically scales on-demand&nbsp;</strong>as instances are created and destroyed. CloudLens uses metadata from cloud platform instances to classify them. Because metadata inherently exists for each new instance created, the cloud platform automatically knows how to treat it and which security and monitoring policies need to be applied. An auto-scaling solution eliminates the burden of&nbsp;manual configuration, therefore mitigating the potential for error.</li> 
<li><strong>Provides secure and highly available monitoring </strong>because the sensors and connectors are deployed within a cloud virtual machine instance and adheres to the same security policies associated with that instance. CloudLens sensors always send packet data via a secure VPN tunnel.</li> 
<li><strong>Is cost-effective</strong> because it uses a pay-per-use model&nbsp;which tracks instances and can scale incrementally.</li> 
<p>All of this is possible in a single platform because CloudLens is built to be cloud-native. It applies the tenets of containerization, dynamic orchestration, and is built as microservices. In contrast, a lift and shift solution is limited in which of these requirements it can address, and to what extent.<br /> <br /> </p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/03/PurposeBuilt-1.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 2 – CloudLens is built on the cloud itself and applies the tenets of containerization, dynamic orchestration and is built as microservices.</em></p> 
<br /> 
<p></p> 
<b>Elastic Scale, Security, and Availability with CloudLens</b> 
<p>CloudLens meets the five requirements of cloud visibility because of how its designed. Let’s examine each of the components of CloudLens and highlight how we leverage the AWS Cloud to deliver elastic scale, high availability, and a secure management portal.</p> 
<p>AWS Lambda is at the core of CloudLens’s serverless architecture. AWS Lambda is designed to use replication and redundancy to provide high availability for both the service and the functions it operates, without maintenance windows or scheduled down times. Events are processed in milliseconds at whatever scale is required. These combined features are designed to provide high availability, virtually unlimited scale, rapid elasticity, and high reliability of the CloudLens management portal. This allows Ixia to deliver a true software-as-a-service, without requiring customers to provision and manage their own VPC environment for visibility management software.</p> 
<p>CloudLens leverages the Amazon API Gateway as a communication proxy, connecting CloudLens Docker agents and customer browser UI instances with our backend business logic. CloudLens Docker agents use API Gateway’s REST calls for management and cloud virtual instance metadata publication, while CloudLens UI session authentication and management also use the API Gateway. Examples of metadata collected by CloudLens agents include underlying instance architecture, operating system information, CPU and memory utilization, performance metrics, pre-populated user data, and network statistics.<br /> <br /> </p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/03/ElasticScale-1.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 3 – CloudLens is built on AWS and meets the five requirements of cloud visibility. AWS Lambda is at the core of CloudLens’s serverless architecture.</em></p> 
<br /> 
<br /> CloudLens uses the AWS IoT Core managed cloud platform to authenticate agents. It employs a bi-directional publish and subscribe model to allow agents to automatically “call home” to identify themselves to the backend portal. It also controls events to dynamically enforce configuration and operational changes on each CloudLens container. 
<p></p> 
<p>Amazon DynamoDB further supports and reinforces our cloud-native architecture to deliver a reliable, low latency service at any scale. Its flexible data model, reliable performance, and automatic scaling of throughput capacity with single millisecond latency makes DynamoDB a great fit to power our managed cloud visibility that can seamlessly scale to tens or hundreds of thousands instances, on demand, without impacting customer experience. AWS CodeCommit is also used to securely store customer environment configuration data.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, our integration with Zuora on AWS allows CloudLens to deliver usage-based pricing with on-demand rapid turn-up and a free 45-day trial.</p> 
<b>How CloudLens Works</b> 
<p>Configuring visibility begins by logging into CloudLens’s management portal and creating a Project. This creates a unique Project Key that is&nbsp;loaded into the visibility sensors running in the source and tool instances, which will be isolated as part of a Project. Once the key is installed in the visibility sensors, they phone home to the central management platform with metadata about the instances.</p> 
<p>The management interface has a smart search capability, which allows users to create source and tool groups based on metadata. This information is auto-populated as search criteria in the management platform. The metadata can also be user defined, allowing maximum flexibility. As new instances are created, they are automatically added to groups based on their metadata. This retains scalability and elasticity in a cloud visibility solution.<br /> <br /> </p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/03/CloudLensPMP-1.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 4 – Users can associate source groups with tool groups to create an encrypted secure visibility path. In CloudLens, this is done in a point-and-click visual interface. </em></p> 
<br /> 
<br /> The next step in configuration is for users to associate source groups with tool groups to create an encrypted secure visibility path. In CloudLens, this is done in a point-and-click visual interface as shown in 
<em>Figure 4</em>. Once defined, the secure visibility path transfers filtered packet data from source to tool instances. 
<p></p> 
<p>Together, the sensor, management platform, and secure visibility path address the challenge of providing visibility within AWS.</p> 
<b>Next Steps</b> 
<p>As enterprises move to AWS, visibility solutions that provide security and compliance are required. To scale, filtering rules cannot be static; rather they must be based on workload attributes and type of traffic. Ixia’s CloudLens has a serverless architecture that scales with distributed software systems built for cloud scale, which delivers intelligent, resilient, and proactive cloud visibility.</p>

The result: KQED reduced Atlassian run cost by 65 percent after migrating to AWS.</p> 
<p>KQED’s television, radio, digital media, and educational services serve the people of Northern California with a community-supported alternative to commercial media. It enabled software development though the use of Atlassian Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, and Bamboo on-premises, but KQED lacked in-house expertise to manage Atlassian solutions in the cloud.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Atlassian&amp;id=001E000000UfZWPIA3">Atlassian</a> is an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/technology/journey/">AWS Technology Partner</a> that develops enterprise software products for developers, project managers, and content management. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=iTMethods%20Inc.&amp;id=001E000000Ufam0IAB">iTMethods</a> is an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/consulting/journey/">AWS Advanced Consulting Partner</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/managed-service/">Managed Service Provider</a> (MSP) that focuses on cloud, agile, and DevOps transformations for the enterprise. Both organizations hold the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/partner-solutions/">AWS DevOps Competency</a>.</p> 
<b>The Solution</b> 
<p>iTMethods leveraged the AWS Jira Data Migration framework and offered implementation services to migrate KQED’s existing on-premises Atlassian environment to AWS, including Jira Software, Jira Service Desk, Bitbucket, Bamboo, Fisheye, and Crucible. iTMethods also helped KQED increase its adoption of the AWS and Atlassian suites by providing best practices on how to use tools that drive more cloud adoption.</p> 
<p>Now, KQED is no longer under-resourcing challenges to hire, train, and retain DevOps talent. It can rely on expert partners—including the managed services provided by iTMethods—to maintain its cloud environment while focusing on core business operations.</p> 
<b>The Results</b> 
<h3>Deployment Time:</h3> 
<li>Enterprise SaaS solution of Atlassian applications on AWS</li> 
<li>Met enterprise architecture and security compliance requirements in&nbsp;three months</li> 
<li>8-week deployment time to production on AWS</li> 
<h3>Cost Optimization:</h3> 
<li>50 percent cost reduction for deployment and migration</li> 
<li>65 percent reduction in ongoing run costs to support, which includes AWS usage</li> 
<h3>Increased Adoption:</h3> 
<li>2-3 times improved time to value for teams running Atlassian</li> 
<li>Migration of current and new instances achieved in weeks and months compared to months and years</li> 
<li>Ongoing optimization of tools, process, and new capabilities</li>

<p><em>By Haider Witwit, Senior Solutions Architect at AWS</em></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/12/28/VMware-Cloud-on-AWS-300x150.jpg">recent launch of VMware Cloud on AWS</a>, you can now run workloads on VMware-managed Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) clusters installed on special bare metal hardware provided by Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) services.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vmware/">VMware Cloud on AWS</a> brings VMware’s SDDC to the AWS Cloud. It is delivered, sold, and supported by VMware as an on-demand, elastically-scalable cloud service that removes barriers to cloud migration and cloud portability, increases IT efficiency, and opens up new opportunities to leverage a hybrid cloud environment. The service is currently available in the AWS US West (Oregon), US East (N. Virginia), and London Regions.</p> 
<p>This post describes a solution for securing workloads on VMware Cloud on AWS that we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xC4xbysR9zY">demonstrated at VMworld 2017</a>. VMware workloads that run in the SDDC cluster can leverage different levels of AWS network and application protection capabilities with minimum to no changes to their application settings.</p> 
<b>Architecture Goals</b> 
<p>The solution focuses on three primary goals:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Provide centralized and secure external application access.</li> 
<li>Accelerate and optimize content delivery for distributed users with advanced application protection.</li> 
<li>Provide data analytics to increase visibility and gain better insights.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>We leveraged Application Load Balancer as a single point of management to distribute traffic to workloads running in both customer-managed virtual private cloud (VPC) and SDDC clusters.</p> 
<p><em>Figure 1</em> shows our overall solution with sample applications running in the VMware-managed SDDC cluster on the right. The cluster runs on special bare metal <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> instances (i3p.16xlarge) in a single tenant VPC owned and operated by VMware. The smallest SDDC cluster size starts with four nodes and can scale up to 32 nodes, with future capacity to scale up to 64 cluster nodes.</p> 
<p>Each host has 64 vCPU, 512 GB memory, and 14 TB raw storage (10.4TB of usable capacity after vSAN caching and metadata). The NSX platform builds an overlay network on top of Amazon EC2 to create logical customer networks and manage connectivity within SDDC boundaries.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/12/20/VMware-Cloud-on-AWS-Sample-Application.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 1 – Overall solution with sample applications running in the VMware SDDC on the right, and third application in customer VPC, all fronted by a single ALB instance.</em></p> 
<p>As part of the SDDC creation process, customers need to create network mapping to a managed VPC for integration with VPC workloads and other AWS services. This mapping is provided by the Enhanced Network Adapter that operates in a customer’s VPC and is utilized by the NSX edge appliance installed in the linked SDDC for east-west traffic (VPC to SDDC workloads).</p> 
<p>Now, let’s get into the details of how we achieved the three architecture goals.</p> 
<h3>1. Enable Secure and Centralized Access to External Applications</h3> 
<p>AWS offers three types of load balancers featuring the high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security necessary for application fault tolerant. We used Application Load Balancer as a single point of management to distribute traffic to workloads running in both customer-managed VPC and SDDC clusters.</p> 
<p>Application Load Balancer acts as a line of defense between the internet and workloads behind it. It is one of the services that helps build DDoS resiliency and scales to handle unexpected volume of traffic within a given AWS Region.</p> 
<p>Application Load Balancer only supports valid TCP connections, so DDoS attacks such as UDP and SYN floods are not able to reach protected resources behind the balancer. It also provides support for SSL offloading using custom certificates or certificates generated by the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service.</p> 
<p>Name resolution is provided by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/">Amazon Route 53</a>—a highly available and scalable DNS service that includes many advanced features like latency-based routing, Geo DNS, health checks, and monitoring. Route53 uses shuffle sharding, anycast stripping, and integration with AWS shield for DDoS mitigation.</p> 
<p>In our design, we have two applications running in SDDC and a third running inside the customer’s VPC to show how a single Application Load Balancer instance can route traffic to different applications across the two environments. Application Load Balancer is configured with single HTTPS 443 listener with multiple rules to route traffic to the appropriate target group based on host header value.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/12/20/VMware-Cloud-on-AWS-Host-Based-Routing.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 2 – Host-based routing setup in Application Load Balancer with rules to route incoming traffic based on domain name specifics to the proper target group.</em></p> 
<p>Each target group points to a specific application and supports EC2 instances and IP-based targets. We used the first for VPC apps and the latter to directly add targets from the SDDC cluster. The IP-based routing is a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-application-load-balancing-via-ip-address-to-aws-on-premises-resources/">new feature of the Application Load Balancer</a>. <em>Figure 2</em> shows a host-based routing setup in Application Load Balancer with rules to route incoming traffic based on domain name specifics to the proper target group.</p> 
<h3>2. Accelerate and Optimize Content Delivery for Distributed Users with Advanced Application Protection</h3> 
<p>Distributed users can suffer slow content delivery and poor experience due to high network latency and low throughput to where data resides. To address this, we used <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon CloudFront</a> to accelerate and optimize content delivery. CloudFront, like Application Load Balancer, supports SSL termination and accepts only well-formed connections. It can prevent many common DDoS attacks by geographically isolating attacks on the infrastructure edge closer to the source, and then scaling to absorb DDoS attacks.</p> 
<p>In addition, CloudFront adds additional layers of application protection by integrating with AWS WAF for L7 attack mitigation against common web exploits like SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.</p> 
<p>In our solution, we have CloudFront distribution with Application Load Balancer origin supporting HTTPS connections only. For WAF configuration, we used a complete automated solution explained in <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/aws-waf-security-automations/overview.html">AWS WAF Security Automations</a>.</p> 
<p>The solution adds basic AWS WAF rules to block common SQL injection and XSS attacks. It uses <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> functions to automatically parse CloudFront access logs looking for suspicious activities, such as high requests or errors from single IP, and then automatically blocks source addresses. The second function leverages information from third-party reputation lists to block request from malicious IP addresses. This integration is demonstrated in <em>Figure 3</em>.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/12/20/AWS-WAF-Automated-Solution.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 3 – AWS WAF automated solution using AWS Lambda for Amazon CloudFront log parsing and IP reputation filtering.</em></p> 
<h3>3. Provide Data Analytic Capabilities to Increase Visibility</h3> 
<p>Collecting and analyzing logs is an important practice to understand application behavior, troubleshooting, and identifying abnormal actives. In this section, we will shed some light on the different infrastructure and application logs you can utilize in our solution:</p> 
<li><strong>Amazon VPC flow logs</strong> capture information about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">Amazon VPC</a>. Information includes IPs, protocols, number of packets, bytes, time stamp, and action taken.</li> 
<li><strong>Application Load Balancer</strong> captures detailed information about requests. Each log contains information such as the time the request was received, client IP, latencies, request paths, and server responses.</li> 
<li><strong>Amazon CloudFront</strong> provides detailed information about every user request it receives for data such as date, time, edge location, number of bytes, client IP, HTTP method, and HTTP status codes.</li> 
<li><strong>AWS CloudTrail</strong> provides event history of the AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs), command line tools, and other services.</li> 
<li><strong>For Amazon EC2 applications</strong>, you can publish logs data from instances running Linux or Windows Server in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">Amazon CloudWatch Logs</a> using CloudWatch agents.</li> 
<li><strong>For SDDC applications</strong>, you can use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/">Amazon Kinesis Firehose</a> agents to collect and send logs. Kinesis Firehose is a fully managed service for delivering real-time streaming data to destinations like Amazon S3.</li> 
<p>Since all logs contain information about the requester’s address, learning the physical locations of where our infrastructure and applications are being accessed can be helpful to analyze access patterns and identify suspicious activities. There are multiple methods to add GeoIP metadata to our logs.</p> 
<p>In our solution, we used a serverless approach with AWS Lambda to transform the logs into a single format and enriched the data by adding the Geo IP coordination. <em>Figure 4</em> shows the data flow from different log sources to AWS Lambda for transformation and data enrichment, Amazon S3 for long term storage, then the two data analytic approaches.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/12/20/VMware-Cloud-on-AWS-Data-Flow.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 4 – Data flow from different log sources to AWS Lambda for transformation and data enrichment, Amazon S3 for long term storage, then the two data analytic approaches.</em></p> 
<p>The enriched data is then stored in Amazon S3 with the necessary lifecycle policies to meet logs retention requirements. From there, we suggest two approaches to analyze logs data.</p> 
<p>First, extract the enriched data using Kinesis Firehose to an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/">AWS-managed Elasticsearch Service</a> cluster for use cases like log analytics, full text search, real-time application monitoring, and clickstream analytics. For visualization and exploration, we utilized the built-in Kibana endpoint included in the managed Elasticsearch domain.</p> 
<p>Next, start analyzing data immediately with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/athena/">Amazon Athena</a>. We don’t need to load any data into Athena, as it works directly with data stored in Amazon S3. Athena is ideal for quick, ad-hoc querying and integrates with <a href="https://quicksight.aws/">Amazon QuickSight</a> for easy visualization with no need to setup or manage any servers.</p> 
<p>You can choose either one or both of these approaches based on your analytics requirements. An automated process to provision the AWS Lambda function for log enrichment and data analytics services can be <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-geotagging-logs">launched from this template</a>.</p> 
<b>Additional Resources</b> 
<p>AWS has a rich portfolio of security, network, storage, and other services that can be utilized by workloads running in the SDDC clusters provided by VMware Cloud on AWS. These capabilities help customers consolidate external access to applications running across VPC and SDDC environments and deploy advanced levels of application protection at the infrastructure edge closer to end users.</p> 
<p>The tight integration between AWS and VMware environments enables you to enhance the security, availability, and reliability of your applications with the hybrid platform capabilities.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vmware/"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/12/05/VMware-Cloud-on-AWS-300x150.png">launch of the VMware Cloud on AWS</a>, many Business Critical Application workloads that were previously difficult to deploy in the cloud no longer require significant platform modifications.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vmware/">VMware Cloud on AWS</a> brings VMware’s Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. It is delivered, sold, and supported by VMware as an on-demand, scalable cloud service that removes barriers to cloud migration and portability, increases IT efficiency, and opens up new opportunities to leverage a hybrid cloud environment. The service is available in the AWS US West (Oregon), US East (N. Virginia), and London Regions.</p> 
<p>A recent&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/apps/2017/11/oracle-rac-vmware-cloud-amazon-aws.html">post on the VMware blog</a> describes a Better Together demonstration that AWS and VMware co-presented at VMworld 2017 using an Oracle RAC database. Enterprises using Oracle RAC now have a seamless transition path to cloud with VMware Cloud on AWS. We chose Oracle RAC for this demonstration for its reliable, high-availability client connection failover supporting a Django-Python application running on native AWS.</p> 
<p><strong><a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/apps/2017/11/oracle-rac-vmware-cloud-amazon-aws.html">See the full&nbsp;architecture on the VMware Blog &gt;&gt;</a></strong></p> 
<b>Benefits of VMware Cloud on AWS</b> 
<p>VMware Cloud on AWS affords many Better Together opportunities to streamline operational processes by leveraging native AWS services. The service enables a cloud-first IT transformation without needing to disruptively re-platform your enterprise Business Critical Application workloads.</p> 
<p>The cloud-based SDDC cluster deployment in our demonstration is simply another data center that is cluster managed the same way you manage on-premises VMware environments, without needing to retool or retrain staff.</p> 
<p>Creating and expanding SDDC clusters can be accomplished in minutes, allowing you to drive utilization to a much higher efficiency without concern for 18- to 24-month capacity planning cycles that must be budgeted for peak usage. Release burst capacity immediately after it’s no longer needed without any CAPEX overhead, as well as the OPEX overhead of running your own data centers.</p>

<p>At Amazon Web Services (AWS), we understand that our government and education customers have unique challenges they must overcome to improve the lives of citizens and students around the world.</p> 
<p>Members of the AWS Partner Network (APN) who attain the AWS Government or Education Competency get special access benefits, event specific benefits, and go-to-market opportunities to reach AWS customers and prospects.</p> 
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/partner-solutions/">AWS Government Competency Partners</a></strong> provide solutions to—and/or have deep experience working with—government customers to deliver mission-critical workloads and applications on AWS.</li> 
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/education/partner-solutions/">AWS Education Competency Partners</a></strong> have demonstrated industry expertise and solutions aligning with AWS architectural best practices for teaching and learning, administration, and academic research efforts.</li> 
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/">AWS Competency Program</a> spotlights APN Partners that have demonstrated technical proficiency and proven customer success in specialized solution areas.&nbsp;We launched the AWS Government Competency in 2016, and in 2017 we announced the AWS Education Competency.</p>

<p>Hear from our APN Partners about how the Government Competency has <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/one-year-later-the-value-of-the-aws-government-competency-for-apn-partners-and-customers/">benefited their businesses</a>.</p> 
<b>Watch: New AWS Public Sector Competency Partner Videos</b>
