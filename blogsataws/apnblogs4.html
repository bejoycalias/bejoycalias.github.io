<p>Our team was&nbsp;especially proud to represent the AWS Partner Network (APN) at the sixth annual <strong>Global Partner Summit</strong>, which included a keynote by Terry Wise, Vice President of Global Alliances, Ecosystem, and Channels, as well as dozens of breakout sessions over two days featuring business and technical topics to help you grow your AWS-based practice.</p> 
<p>Here is some key information and launches&nbsp;we announced at&nbsp;Global Partner Summit 2017:</p> 
<b>Watch: Keynote by Terry Wise</b> 
<p>The AWS Partner Network (APN)&nbsp;comprises&nbsp;tens of thousands of&nbsp;organizations&nbsp;from all across the globe, and in 2017 we added more than 10,000 new APN Partners. During his keynote, Terry Wise introduced several new programs and initiatives for APN Partners, including how AWS is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/blockchain/">investing in blockchain</a> through our APN ecosystem. AWS provides the broadest and deepest capabilities and the largest global infrastructure for building end-to-end blockchain platforms. We will be launching an AWS Blockchain Competency in 2018, and you can sign up for our&nbsp;<a href="http://go.awspartner.com/apn-partner-blockchain-interest">Blockchain for AWS Partners interest list</a>&nbsp;to learn more.</p> 
<p>Guest speakers from the keynote included Colleen Manaher from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, John Nichols from PG&amp;E, and Steve Bashada from Siemans PLM. Terry was also joined by AWS CEO Andy Jassy an Dr. Matt Wood, GM of Artificial Intelligence at AWS. This video is available for APN Partners only and requires a Partner Central account to view.</p> 
<p><a href="https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/apex/WebcastMain?sfdc.tabName=01rE0000000AEBc">Watch Terry’s keynote (requires Partner Central login) &gt;&gt;</a></p> 
<b>Watch: Breakout Sessions for Business and Technical Tracks</b> 
<p>Global Partner Summit featured many breakout sessions and you can watch videos of each in a PDF we have created. This document provides a brief description of the business and technical sessions from Global Partner Summit, as well as links to each recording on YouTube. The content is also available&nbsp;on Partner Central under&nbsp;the Content tab.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/12/06/Global-Partner-Summit-2017-Breakout-Sessions.pdf">Watch the Global Partner Summit breakout sessions &gt;&gt;</a></p> 
<b>New Programs for APN Consulting Partners</b> 
<h3>AWS Solution Provider Program</h3> 
<p>We are enhancing and rebranding a key partner program—the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/channel-reseller/">Channel Reseller Program</a>—to further recognize and reward APN Consulting Partners with proven solution capabilities who are building the future on behalf of customers. The program is now called the AWS Solution Provider Program, and it will have a tiered incentive structure, including additional incentives for bringing new customer opportunities to AWS, more choice in contracting with AWS, and will include more flexible AWS Support options. The program will be launched in early 2018, and you can sign up for our&nbsp;<a href="http://go.awspartner.com/solution-provider-program">AWS Solution Provider Program interest list</a> to learn more.</p> 
<h3>Amazon Alexa for Business Service Delivery</h3> 
<p>At re:Invent, the AWS Service Delivery Program launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/alexaforbusiness/solutions/">Amazon Alexa for Business</a>&nbsp;to help solve tasks like calendar management, dialing into meetings, and searching for information. Amazon Alexa can simplify conference rooms, allowing meeting attendees to start and control the equipment in a room by using their voice. It can also provide directions to a conference room, notify IT about a broken printer, place an order for office supplies, and more.</p> 
<p>Alexa for Business Partners include software developers who have built voice skills for their applications, conferencing partners that use Alexa for Business APIs to simplify meetings, and APN Consulting Partners who help customers develop Alexa for Business and develop custom skills. See our current list of&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/alexaforbusiness/solutions/">Alexa for Business Partners</a>.</p> 
<b>New Programs for APN Technology Partners</b> 
<h3>AWS Machine Learning Competency</h3>

<p>We are proud to announce the launch of <strong>APN Badge Manager</strong>—a tool that allows Standard-tier and above APN Partners to access, manage, and create custom badges to showcase the APN Program designations and AWS Competencies that your company holds.</p> 
<p>Over the past several years, we have received a number of requests from APN Partners to help make sense of the program logos we make available to them upon attainment of new program designations. Previously, there were more than 2,000 potential badge combinations between a partner’s APN Program tier (Premier, Advanced, or Standard), partner type (Consulting or Technology), and designations&nbsp;such as&nbsp;AWS Public Sector Partner Program, AWS Managed Service Provider (MSP) Program, or specific AWS Competencies.</p> 
<p>With APN Badge Manager, APN Partners can build customized badges to suit different&nbsp;communications goals. The tool will dynamically create an APN Badge with up to five program components. If you have more than five, you can create multiple APN Badges to suit each use case. For example, you can create one APN Badge to showcase your APN Program level and another&nbsp;badge to showcase your APN Competencies.</p> 
<p><a href="https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/SiteLogin">To get started, login to APN Partner Central and select the Badge Manager link on the left menu &gt;&gt;</a></p> 
<b>How it Works</b> 
<p>The tool&nbsp;is available to the Alliance Lead contact in APN Partner Central for all Standard-tier and above APN Partners. It&nbsp;contains both a Badge Library and Badge Builder tab.</p> 
<p>The Badge Library provides access to a partner’s default badges, as well as custom badges that were previously created. The Badge Builder allows a partner to select up to five eligible program elements to appear in a custom badge, as well as select the order in which they would like each element to appear.</p> 
<p>Upon achievement of a new program designation, a default badge is automatically created by the tool, and placed in the Badge Library tab for immediate download.</p> 
<p>All default and custom badges are also automatically updated when a partner moves from tier to tier. APN Badges are made available for download in the EPS file format. The EPS format is a versatile, scalable, and high-resolution vector format that can be converted into other formats using a number of different tools.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>By Mandus Momberg, Partner Solutions Architect at AWS</em></p> 
<p>As customers continue to extend applications into the cloud, leveraging a consistent on-premises and cloud platform helps manage resources through a familiar interface across both environments.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-servicebroker-documentation/wiki">AWS Service Broker</a> is a new open source project that allows APN Partners to integrate AWS services directly into their solutions. Customers can then deploy AWS services without leaving the application platform of choice. Built around the industry standard <a href="https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/">Open Service Broker API</a>, the AWS Service Broker can be seamlessly integrated with any platform which has adopted the API specification.</p> 
<p>Users of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, for example, can provision AWS services directly from the platform without interfacing with the AWS API. Learn more about our <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/latest-version-red-hat-openshift-container-platform-joins-infrastructure-and-services-across-hybrid-cloud-environments">collaboration with Red Hat</a> as the first APN Partner to leverage AWS Service Broker.</p> 
<p>Currently, the AWS Service Broker supports 10 native AWS services with more to be added in the near future. The supported services are:</p> 
<li>Amazon DynamoDB</li> 
<li>Amazon ElastiCache</li> 
<li>Amazon EMR</li> 
<li>Amazon Route 53</li> 
<li>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)</li> 
<li>Amazon Redshift</li> 
<li>Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</li> 
<li>Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)</li> 
<li>Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)</li> 
<li>Amazon Athena</li> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/29/AWS-Service-Broker.png" /></p> 
<p>With the AWS Service Broker, you can provision AWS services such as Amazon RDS directly from the application platform and seamlessly bind the database to your app. The AWS Service Broker securely provides your application with the connection string and credentials required to connect to the managed Amazon RDS instance.</p>

<p><em>By Ash Mazhari, Global Lead, Artificial Intelligence for AWS Marketplace</em></p> 
<p>AWS Marketplace now has a machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) discovery&nbsp;page that makes it easier to buy software from vendors that are integrated with or running on Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p> 
<p><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mp/ai">Visit the AWS Marketplace ML and AI discovery page &gt;&gt;</a></strong></p> 
<p>The discovery page features software providers for a variety of data engineer, data scientist, and developer use cases, and helps you select the right products faster by showcasing products within the following subcategories:</p> 
<li>Data Services</li> 
<li>Machine Learning and Data Science Tools</li> 
<li>Intelligent APIs and Solutions</li> 
<p>The new&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/partner-solutions/">AWS Machine Learning Competency</a> was announced at the Global Partner Summit at AWS re:Invent 2017, and we are proud to highlight the featured AWS Marketplace sellers who have earned the&nbsp;ML Competency: Alteryx, Domino, SigOpt, Trifacta, and Veritone. These vendors, and more, offer more than 60 products on AWS Marketplace to help you solve ML and AI challenges, including data ingestion, preprocessing, hosting, model building, tuning, testing, optimization, computer vision, neuro-linguistic programming, and more.</p> 
<p>The ML and AI solutions you can purchase on AWS Marketplace are billed to your AWS account rather than billed separately by the vendor. You can pay as you go, and with AWS Marketplace, you can easily manage all your software subscriptions in one place.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mp/ai/"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/28/Marketplace-ML-and-AI-page-977x1024.png" /></a></p> 
<b>Amazon’s Investment in ML and AI</b> 
<p>Amazon has invested deeply in artificial intelligence for more than 20 years, and many of the capabilities customers experience each day are driven by machine learning. Amazon.com’s recommendations engine is driven by ML, for example, as are the paths that optimize robotic picking routes in our fulfillment centers.</p> 
<p>Our supply chain, forecasting, and capacity planning are also informed by ML algorithms. Alexa is fueled by Natural Language Understanding and Automated Speech Recognition deep learning, as is our drone initiative, Prime Air, and the computer vision technology in our new retail experience, Amazon Go.</p> 
<p>At AWS, we’re focused on bringing that knowledge and capability to you through three layers of the AI stack:</p> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/#ai_frameworks">Frameworks and infrastructure</a> with tools like Apache MXNet and TensorFlow</li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/#ai_services">API-driven services</a> to quickly add intelligence to applications</li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/#ai_platforms">Machine learning platforms</a> for data scientists</li> 
<p>Now, AWS Marketplace offers customers an even greater variety of AI and ML tools to meet their needs thanks to startups and independent software vendors that have quickly adapted to the market need for ML and AI solutions. Many of these vendors are&nbsp;offer a variety of tools that are available on AWS Marketplace.</p> 
<b>Getting Started</b> 
<p>With AWS Marketplace, you can navigate, discover, purchase, and deploy the software needed to process data, build and optimize ML and AI models, and build intelligent applications to fuel innovation.</p> 
<p>Get started using ML and AI tools and building intelligent applications by visiting the new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mp/ai">AWS Marketplace ML and AI discovery page</a>.</p>

<p>AWS Networking Competency Partners are Advanced APN Tier Partners that provide network solutions to assist customers in adopting, developing, and deploying applications on AWS.&nbsp;They offer a set of specialized solutions that auto-scale, align with cloud design principles, and make it easier to use networking features in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).</p> 
<p>The AWS Networking Competency launched with 18 APN Partners across five categories: networking connectivity, AWS Direct Connect integration and infrastructure, load balancers, and network management.</p> 
<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/networking/partner-solutions">Visit the AWS Networking Competency page &gt;&gt;</a></p> 
<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/networking/partner-solutions"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/28/networking_competency_570x245.png" /></a></p> 
<b>What is the AWS Networking Competency?</b> 
<p>We’ve set a high bar to become an AWS Networking Competency Partner, as we want to help customers identify and connect with APN Partners that can support them in multiple areas, including networking connectivity, AWS Direct Connect, load balancers, and network management.</p> 
<p>To become an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/networking/partner-solutions">AWS Networking Competency Partner</a>, enterprises undergo a strict validation of their capabilities to demonstrate technical proficiency and proven customer success. These APN Partners must also complete a technical audit of their networking solution or practice.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/">AWS Competency Program</a> is the global APN Partner program that helps customers find the most qualified organizations with deep expertise and proven customer success. In addition to networking, we are focused on providing customers and sellers with guidance in solution areas like Big Data, DevOps, Migration, and AWS IoT; in vertical markets such as Financial Services, Healthcare, Life Sciences, Government, and Digital Media; and with enterprise business applications like Microsoft Workloads and SAP.</p>

<p><em>By Christian Champagne, CEO at Blu Age</em></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/03/Migration-300x150.jpg">Blu Age</a> customers in sectors such as banking, insurance, and government built their IT based on mainframe technologies from the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. These systems were further complicated in the late 1990s and early 2000s by the addition of client/server layers to the mainframe core.</p> 
<p>The complexity of these architectures combined with the cost of removing technical debt helps explain why there are still hundreds of billions of lines of COBOL code being maintained today. It also helps explain why businesses are constrained and limited by their own legacy mainframes.</p> 
<p>Mainframes host valuable assets such as processes and rules, data that can fuel innovation, and core-business value—if only they are agile and lean enough. So how do you transform mainframe assets to suppress technical debt, cut costs, and remove inefficiencies? In other words: How do you migrate mainframe assets to Amazon Web Services (AWS) in order to combine both the value of core-business IT assets and the value of AWS?</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.blugenius.com/">Blu Genius</a> is a legacy-COBOL-to-Cloud portal powered by Blu Age Velocity. It automates the transformation from mainframe legacy languages, databases, and file-systems to agile service-oriented applications on AWS.</p> 
<p>With Blu Genius on AWS, customers and partners can:</p> 
<li>Transform COBOL programs to Java-based applications with Automated Refactoring</li> 
<li>Check the completeness of the candidate programs and data structures for refactoring</li> 
<li>Perform a Proof of Concept to validate the transformation and performance</li> 
<li>Experience various managed AWS&nbsp;services embedded in the target application</li> 
<li>Evaluate the financial estimate for transformation using online configurators</li> 
<li>Manage the code coverage of the test cases used to test functional equivalence</li>

<b>Evaluating Mainframe Migration Options</b> 
<p>There are several mainframe migration options that can be evaluated based on speed, agility, cloud maturity, and business value.</p> 
<h3>Re-Host</h3> 
<p>Re-host uses an emulator to move, translate, and recompile legacy applications on AWS. It keeps the original COBOL code mostly intact, but it’s not a simple lift-and-shift. Rather, it’s a complex re-platforming project where the COBOL code is tailored to a permanent third-party emulator, and then adapted to many third-party utilities for output management, sorting, printing, data storage, and charge-back.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, re-host does not take advantage of micro-services, elasticity, or service-oriented languages like Java or .NET, and it cannot easily integrate with cloud-native applications or AWS services for big data analytics, artificial intelligence, or mobile enablement. This type of transformation can reduce operating expenses but is best suited if legacy applications are close to the end of their product lifecycle.</p> 
<h3>Replace</h3> 
<p>Replace is an approach where the legacy mainframe application is replaced by commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software. Finding a COTS solution that covers 100% of an organization’s business needs is difficult, requiring an exhaustive list of requirements, use cases, and business rules. This typically leads to the development of custom code for equivalent functionality, similar to risky and time-consuming manual re-write projects.</p> 
<h3>Re-Write</h3> 
<p>Re-write refers to the manual redevelopment of legacy code in a newer language, and it’s not easy because of the need to retroactively specify all software requirements. It’s difficult to certify the completeness and accuracy of the retroactive specification, making like-for-like testing nearly impossible. Furthermore, legacy mainframe applications, especially COBOL batch processes, are designed to make the most out of scarce compute resources, requiring deep technical knowledge and appropriate tooling. A manual rewrite can take many years to complete, increasing risk and reducing the overall business value proposition.</p> 
<b>Automated Refactoring</b> 
<p>Automated refactoring addresses an organization’s need for speed, accuracy, and agility of the transformed application. This process extracts the application model from the source code and refactors the model to the desired target architecture, forward-generating new object- and service-oriented code. The new code eliminates technical debt, taking advantage of popular application frameworks such as Angular and SpringBoot combined with AWS-managed services such as Amazon Aurora, Amazon ElastiCache, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.</p> 
<p>Typically, the resulting architecture of an automated refactoring effort executes on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances or Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS) containers. Data can be hosted by Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) and Amazon Aurora for both relational database managers (DB2 z/OS, Datacom) and modernized legacy file-based data store (VSAM, SEQ).</p> 
<p>Elastic Beanstalk can automatically manage capacity provisioning, load balancing, and automatic scaling of compute instances. Mainframe in-memory distributed data structures can be stored in Amazon ElastiCache, and after automated refactoring the resulting micro-services are accessible directly via the Elastic Load Balancer. They can also be accessed asynchronously via Amazon SQS or as an Application Programing Interface (API) via Amazon API Gateway. The mainframe batch programs can be submitted and dispatched with AWS Batch.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/22/Mainframe-Automated-Refactoring-on-AWS-1024x671.png" /></p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 1 – Mainframe Automated Refactoring on AWS.</em></p> 
<p>Automated refactoring is agile with a flexible automation process, creating a customizable AWS cloud-native application architecture. It’s modern because generated code leverages popular frameworks such as Angular and SpringBoot. It’s versatile with a large variety of legacy languages such as COBOL or PL/1 transformed into desired AWS-ready Java. It’s simple, as no prior knowledge of legacy languages is required. It produces quality code and maintainable code with measurable metrics. And it’s fast with automated refactoring being much quicker than a traditional manual re-write and about as fast as COBOL emulator re-host projects.</p> 
<h3>How Blu Age Empowers Automated Refactoring</h3> 
<p>Blu Age Automated Refactoring software extracts all functional features and business rules from the legacy mainframe source code and rewrites them automatically in digital- and cloud-ready architecture. It also includes data and database migration for continuous testing.</p> 
<p>Blu Age Analyzer creates an application model from the source code, facilitates the allotment for the modernization project, and allows for planning phases and budget. It collects and analyzes information from the source code assets, data structures, use cases, and functional interdependencies. It provides various graphics and tables that present program calls, control flows, dependencies, metrics, optimization suggestions of the legacy source code, and data structure in order to simplify maintenance and improve performance.</p> 
<p>Based on actual dependency analysis, Blu Age Analyzer decomposes applications into subsystems to solve inter-programs dependencies as well as deployment data dependencies. This assessment of the legacy portfolio provides key elements for understanding the modernization scenarios. It enables a complete screening of the legacy applications to accelerate and secure modernization projects.</p> 
<p>Blu Age Velocity expedites automated refactoring and lowers the cost with a pre-selected target software stack based on Java, AngularJS, SpringBoot, Spring Statemachine, and REST APIs. All transformation options are calculated in advance and driven by Blu Age Analyzer.</p> 
<h3>Automated Refactoring with Blu Age Velocity involves the following steps:</h3> 
<ol> 
<li>Import legacy code in Blu Age Analyzer and tag programs and data structure to define relevant work packages.</li> 
<li>Export tagged artifacts to Blu Age PLTC (COBOL 2 SpringBoot) to extract functional specifications from the work packages to UML models. Generate Angular/SpringBoot base code from UML models. Package Java code using Maven and NPM.</li> 
<li>Export legacy data to the modernized data structure and load it on the targeted database such as Amazon Aurora.</li> 
<li>Deploy the packaged applications on the desired AWS services. Run functional tests for acceptance. Check code base compliance to the requested quality rating.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Steps 2 to 4 are fully automated and can be integrated within a DevOps pipeline with Blu Age Velocity silent version. This automated transformation guarantees functional equivalence even for complex Mainframe batch processes.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/22/Blue-Age-Automated-Refactoring-Process-1024x334.png" /></p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 2 – Blu Age Automated Refactoring process.</em></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<b>Customer Benefits</b> 
<p>Customers benefit from COBOL applications being transformed by Blu Age automation into cloud-native applications in as little as 6-8 months (SIT and UAT included). The Blu Age Velocity platform accelerates the conversion even further; on average, 1 million lines of COBOL code can be transformed and tested in one month. Prices range from $0.10 to $2.00 per LoC utilizing onshore resources, depending on architecture, language, and scope of services.</p> 
<p>Blu Age software produces code with high development quality standards, which can be measured daily using SonarQube or CAST software, and which can be maintained without the use of Blu Age tools. Blu Age’s high level of automation allows the adoption of DevOps Continuous Integration Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines and a more rapid integration with AWS services.</p> 
<p>Because the legacy design is transformed into modern language service-oriented code on AWS, customers also benefit&nbsp;by eliminating technical debt being, allowing mobile-friendly web interfaces to improve user experience, leveraging AWS elasticity, and replacing&nbsp;mainframe capital expenditures&nbsp;with pay-as-you-go operating expenses.</p>
