<h6>By Ben Perak, APN Global Segment Leader</h6> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/service-delivery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Service Delivery Program</a> launched in November 2016 with one simple goal: to help customers easily identify AWS Partner Network (APN) Partners with a successful track record of delivering specific AWS services and a demonstrated ability to provide expertise in a particular service or skill area.</p> 
<p>Nineteen AWS services are included in the AWS Service Delivery Program, including many database services, compute services, content delivery services, security services, serverless computing services, and analytics services. This program also highlights APN Partners who deliver workloads in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region.</p> 
<p>Today, we’re excited to announce the addition of four AWS Management Tools to the program: AWS CloudFormation, Amazon EC2 Systems Manager, AWS Config and AWS CloudTrail.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/service-delivery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-4936 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/08/12/800x200_Management-01.png" alt="" width="3334" height="834" /></a></p> 
<h3>Raising the Bar in Cloud Management with AWS Management Tools Service Delivery Partners</h3> 
<p>Cloud operations are quickly shifting from ‘How do I do it’ to ‘How do I do it BETTER.’ That is why AWS has developed an extensive portfolio of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/products/management/?nc2=h_l3_db" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Management Tools</a> that provide APN Partners and customers with leading cloud-management capabilities. These services –whether used individually or combined as an end-to-end solution—provide cloud operations teams with the solutions they need to keep pace with their agile businesses. Whether it is provisioning resources or a group of resources called stacks via AWS CloudFormation, pushing OS patches at scale with Amazon EC2 Systems Manager, tracking configuration changes in a highly regulated environment using AWS Config, or keeping track of user activity with AWS CloudTrail—these services have you covered. Combined with our APN Partners’ deep domain knowledge, customers can be assured they are getting a world class cloud management solution.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>“AWS Management Tools solutions let our customers access the big advantage of cloud: the ability to provision, query and compare the current to desired state,” says Flux7 Chief Technology Officer Ali Hussain. “These services allow us to easily move from an early stage proof of concept to an enterprise-ready product, adding in compliance, security, and long-term maintenance controls.”</p> 
</blockquote> 
<h3>Congratulations to our Launch Partners:</h3> 
<p>The following APN Consulting Partners have demonstrated their ability to raise the bar in delivering results with these services and have become Management Tools Service Delivery launch partners:</p>

<h3>Why should APN Consulting Partners with expertise in Management Tools join?</h3>

Additionally, you’ll be distinguished as an expert in the applicable service in the Partner Solutions Finder and will be featured on the services partner page.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>AWS is enabling scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solutions for banking and payments, capital markets, and insurance organizations of all sizes, from startups to global enterprises. To support the seamless integration and deployment of these solutions, AWS established the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/financial-services/partner-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Services Partner Competency Program</a> to identify AWS Partner Network (APN) Consulting and Technology partners with deep industry experience to assist our customers in their migration to the AWS Cloud. AWS Financial Services Competency Partners have demonstrated industry expertise, readily implemented solutions that align with AWS architectural best practices, and have AWS-certified staff.</p> 
<p>This year at the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/summits/new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS NY Summit</a>, some of our AWS Competency Partners are demonstrating the unique and innovative work they’ve done with customers. If you are attending the NY Summit on August 14th, don’t miss these sessions:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>AWS Financial Services Competency Partners and the 2017 AWS New York Summit</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Guest post by Scot Johnson, a Solution Architect for ConvergeHEALTH by Deloitte, part of Deloitte Consulting LLP’s Innovation group (DCI).</em></p> 
<p>In light of new laws such as the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">21st Century Cures Act</a> and evolving scientific insights, life sciences companies are being pressed to demonstrate clinical value to payers and health authorities.&nbsp; As a result, life sciences companies are shifting the way they develop and bring their pharmaceutical and medical products to market through the application of Real World Evidence (RWE). In order to discover, optimize, and demonstrate the value of RWE, life sciences companies are embracing new strategies, deeper partnerships, and innovative technology solutions. Industry-wide shifts, such as the move from volume-based to value-based payment models and more personalized healthcare, have helped fuel interest in RWE to demonstrate the value of drug and device innovations.</p> 
<p>In this blog post, I will discuss the business drivers behind the rising importance of RWE to life sciences companies for research and product development, and how Deloitte’s ConvergeHEALTH Evidence Lifecycle Management Platform on the AWS Cloud enables RWE use cases to drive real world business value.</p> 
<h3></h3> 
<h3>Delivering Value to Pharmas through RWE</h3> 
<p>The biopharmaceutical landscape has transformed due to significant advancements in science, increases in the amounts and types of data, shifts in market economics, legislation, and reimbursements. The rise of data volumes and disparate data sources, including health records, lab results, sensors, images, genomics, and claims data, have resulted in a shift from traditional research and development approaches to new collaborative models that integrate non-traditional partners across geographically dispersed resources and participants. A growing number of life sciences organizations are accommodating these disruptions with scalable on-demand storage and compute capabilities necessary to accelerate the shift toward data-driven insights and end-to-end evidence management.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/27/rwe1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-4874 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/27/rwe1.png" alt="" width="882" height="410" /></a></p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 1: Business value increases as RWE is leveraged across research, clinical development, and commercialization business functions</em></p> 
<h3></h3> 
<h3>Deloitte’s ConvergeHEALTH Evidence Lifecycle Management Platform</h3> 
<p>In response to the growing demand for data-driven insights and evidence lifecycle management (ELM), Deloitte developed the ConvergeHEALTH Evidence Lifecycle Management Platform on the AWS Cloud. &nbsp;The ConvergeHEALTH ELM Platform leverages an integrated AWS Cloud environment preconfigured with the relevant data and tools. &nbsp;The ConvergeHEALTH ELM Platform consists of three main configurable layers, designed to help our clients in their efforts to quickly realize the promise of RWE and big data analytics: data layer, analysis layer, and knowledge layer.&nbsp; The platform’s flexible, modular design and open architectures empower domain experts and facilitate business function integration into existing and emerging plug-in analytic services from vendors and open source communities.</p> 
<h3></h3> 
<h3>High-Level Architecture<br /> <a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/27/rwe2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4875" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/27/rwe2.png" alt="" width="1125" height="521" /></a></h3> 
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 2: Reference architecture for the ConvergeHEALTH ELM Platform</em></p> 
<p><strong>Data layer</strong> – Facilitates the organization, governance, and usability of disparate datasets in support of the life science organization’s mission.</p> 
<p><strong>Analysis layer</strong> – Houses the analytic tools and processes for data exploration and analysis.</p> 
<p><strong>Knowledge management layer</strong> – Defines and powers RWE governance policies, tools, roles, and processes across the platform.</p> 
<h3></h3> 
<h3>Platform Products and Accelerators</h3> 
<p>The ConvergeHEALTH ELM Platform includes several components to give enterprises visibility into information that exists within the organization and enable stakeholders to collaborate across their enterprise.</p> 
<p><strong>Cohort Insight</strong> – Cohort selection service (available as an API) with a web UI that allows cohort querying against datasets stored in the AWS Cloud. Allows users to iteratively apply inclusion/exclusion cohort selection criteria and facilitate interactive cohort exploration.</p> 
<p><strong>Cohort Integrator</strong> – Cohort synchronization service (available as an API) that synchronizes cohorts across multiple datasets, accelerating data exploration and reducing time to insights.</p> 
<p><strong>Data Asset Explorer &amp; Characterization Service</strong> – A microservices API that collects domain-specific dataset profiling results for data search, discovery, and profiling.</p> 
<p><strong>Research Trust for Big Data</strong> – A standards-based data linkage and semantic governance model and repository built on the big data technologies Hadoop, Hive, Impala, and Spark.&nbsp; Research Trust facilitates the organization, linkage, semantic standardization, and exploration of data across multiple datasets.</p> 
<h3></h3> 
<h3>ConvergeHEALTH Evidence Lifecycle Management Platform Implementation on AWS<br /> <a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/27/rwe3.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-4876 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/27/rwe3.png" alt="" width="1125" height="454" /></a></h3> 
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 3: High-level AWS reference architecture for the ConvergeHEALTH ELM Platform</em></p> 
<p>The following section highlights some key concepts of the ConvergeHealth ELM Platform and its implementation on AWS.</p> 
<h4>Security Elements</h4> 
<p>Protecting and managing patient health information (e.g., data encryption, authorized access, transporting of patient data across networks and borders) is managed by the ConvergeHEALTH ELM Platform through AWS services.</p> 
<h4>HIPAA Considerations</h4> 
<p>AWS aligns its HIPAA risk management program with FedRAMP and NIST 800-53, which are higher security standards that map to the HIPAA Security Rule. AWS provides a standard Business Associate agreement (called the “Business Associate Addendum,” or BAA) for customers deploying on the platform. &nbsp;Customers can use any AWS service in an account designated as a HIPAA Account under the BAA, but they must only process, store, and transmit protected health information (PHI) using certain <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/hipaa-eligible-services-reference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HIPAA Eligible Services</a> defined in the BAA.</p> 
<h4>Encryption</h4> 
<p>Consistent with the AWS BAA, PHI on the ConvergeHEALTH ELM Platform is encrypted both in-transit and at-rest. Data at-rest on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), and data in-transit is encrypted using [256-bit SSL].</p> 
<h4>Identity and Access Management</h4> 
<p>The AWS environment for the ConvergeHEALTH ELM Platform relies on AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to authorize, authenticate, and enforce user policies. IAM policies and roles allow resource access to be fine-tuned for the myriad roles within the enterprise.</p> 
<h3></h3> 
<h3>Configuration Management</h3> 
<h4>Virtual Private Clouds</h4> 
<p>The ConvergeHEALTH ELM Platform leverages Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), which allows customers to launch their AWS resources into a virtual network that closely resembles an on-premises environment combined with the benefits of using the scalable AWS infrastructure.</p> 
<h4>Automated Deployment</h4> 
<p>Using AWS CloudFormation templates, we’ve pre-defined and automated the deployment of the Cohort Insight application (see Figure 4). The CloudFormation template for Cohort Insight includes launch configurations and Auto Scaling groups of EC2 instances coupled with AWS Elastic Load Balancing.&nbsp; The template provides rapid, repeatable, and reliable on-demand deployment of Cohort Insight to handle unpredictable analytic workloads to reduce query response times and shorten time to insight.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/27/rwe4.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-4877 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/27/rwe4.png" alt="" width="875" height="458" /></a></p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 4: AWS CloudFormation template for Cohort Insight</em></p> 
<h4>High Availability</h4> 
<p>AWS services have been designed to natively leverage multiple Availability Zones to build highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable solutions. For customers who desire highly available RWE applications for improved uptime necessary to meet internal stakeholders’ SLAs, the ConvergeHEALTH architecture can be configured with either a single AWS Region composed of multiple Availability Zones, or across multiple AWS Regions with multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone consists of one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.</p> 
<p>The ConvergeHEALTH ELM Platform also uses native service features for high-availability deployment such as the Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) and its out-of-the-box high availability and replication features.</p> 
<h3></h3> 
<h3>Example Big Pharma Deployment</h3> 
<h4>Vision</h4> 
<p>A Big Pharma organization was seeking opportunities to shift to value-based, personalized health care to help patients live longer, healthier lives.</p> 
<h4>Cloud Strategy</h4> 
<p>Their cloud strategy provides end-to-end visibility across the information value chain with connected processes and platforms across all functions to improve R&amp;D productivity, product launch effectiveness, and overall operational excellence.</p> 
<h4>Solution</h4> 
<p>They chose the ConvergeHEALTH ELM Platform on AWS to serve as the global foundation for facilitating information discovery, access, analysis, governance, collaborations, and partnerships, both internally and externally.</p> 
<h4>Impact</h4> 
<p>The ConvergeHEALTH ELM Platform provides transparency into available data across the enterprise, facilitating the sharing of insights and enabling researchers to collaborate.&nbsp; Multiple disparate datasets are connected to gain new insights. And by developing new coordinated partner strategies, they are able to build networks of strategic partners with advanced and integrated expertise.</p> 
<h3></h3> 
<h3>Realizing the Business Benefits from RWE and Next Steps</h3> 
<p>Managing the shift from volume-based to value-based payment models and the move to personalized health care will require more agile real-world evidence capabilities along with new strategies, partnerships, and technologies. Pharmas that manage the transformative shift to operationally utilize RWE will be positioned to realize the potential and business value of RWE. Deloitte focuses on helping companies achieve these results/objectives through its relationship with AWS and the blending of our skills and capabilities to make our client’s transformative shift to RWE a manageable journey.</p>

Today’s cloud evolved MSPs are able to drive revolutionizing business outcomes, even including DevOps transformations. This week in the MSP Partner Spotlight series, we hear from Jason McKay, CTO of Logicworks, as he writes about the importance of automation in operations and helping their customers meet their DevOps goals.</p>

<h3>Getting the “Ops” Half of DevOps Right: Automation and Self-Service Infrastructure</h3> 
<h4>By Jason McKay, CTO of Logicworks</h4> 
<p>DevOps has been a major cultural force in IT for the past ten years. But a <a href="http://info.xmatters.com/rs/178-CPU-592/images/atlassian_devops_survey.pdf?_ga=2.9256501.1430386044.1498589892-589850621.1498589892" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gap remains</a> between what companies expect to get out of DevOps and the day-to-day realities of working on a IT team.</p> 
<p>Over the past ten years, I’ve helped hundreds of IT teams manage a DevOps cultural shift as part of my role as CTO of Logicworks. Many of the companies we work with have established a customer-focused culture and have made some investments in application delivery and automation, such as building a CI/CD pipeline, automating code testing, and more.</p> 
<p>But the vast majority of those companies still struggle with IT operations. Their systems engineers spend far too much time putting out fires and manually building, configuring, and maintaining infrastructure. A <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/qualis-survey-offers-insights-about-it-challenges-in-cloud-and-devops-300423438.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent survey</a> found that it takes more than a month to deliver new infrastructure for 33 percent of companies, and more than half had no access to self-service infrastructure. The result is that systems engineers burn out quickly, developers are frustrated, and new projects are delayed. Add to the mix a constantly shifting regulatory landscape and dozens of new platforms and tools to support, and chances are that your operations team is pretty overwhelmed.</p> 
<p>Migrating to Amazon Web Services (AWS) is often the first step to improving infrastructure and security operations for DevOps teams. AWS is the foundation for infrastructure delivery for the largest and most mature DevOps teams in the world, but running IT operations on AWS the same way you did on traditional infrastructure is simply not going to work.</p> 
<h3>The Power of Automation</h3> 
<p>Transforming operations teams for DevOps begins with a cultural shift in the way engineers perceive infrastructure. You’ve no doubt heard it before: Operations can no longer be the culture of “no.” Keeping the lights on is no longer enough.</p> 
<p>The key technology and process change that supports this cultural change is infrastructure automation. If you’re already running on AWS, there is no better cloud service for building a mature infrastructure automation practice—it integrates with what your developers are doing to automate code deployment, and makes it easier for your company to launch and test new software.</p> 
<p>AWS has all the tools you need. But you also need people who know how to use those tools. That’s what Logicworks helps companies do. We are an extension of our clients’ IT teams, helping them figure out IT operations on AWS in this new world of DevOps and constant change.</p> 
<p>Our corporate history mirrors the journey most companies are going through today. Ten years ago, the engineers at Logicworks also spent most of their time nurturing physical systems back to health, responding to crises, and manually maintaining systems. When Amazon Web Services launched, we initially wondered if we would have a place in this new paradigm. Where does infrastructure maintenance fit in a world where companies want infrastructure “out of the way” of their fast-moving development teams? Then we realized that not only could we keep managing infrastructure, but we could do something an order of magnitude more sophisticated and elegant for our clients. We started to approach the business not as racking and stacking hardware, but instead using AWS to create responsive and customized infrastructure without human intervention. That really changed the business model.</p> 
<p>Today our engineers spend their time writing and maintaining automation scripts that orchestrate AWS infrastructure, not manually maintaining the thousands of instances under our control. In many ways, we have become a software company. We write custom software for each client that makes it easier for their operations teams to deliver AWS infrastructure quickly and securely. Of course we still have 24x7x365 NOC teams, networking professionals, DBAs, etc., but all of our teams approach every infrastructure problem with this question: How can we perform this (repetitive, manual) task smarter? How can we stop doing this over and over and focus on solutions that make a substantial difference for our customers?</p> 
<h3>Infrastructure Automation in Practice</h3> 
<p>Many of the best practices of software development — continuous integration, versioning, automated testing — are now the best practices of systems engineers. In enterprises that have embraced the public cloud, servers, switches, and hypervisors are now strings and brackets in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). The scripts that spin up an instance or configure a network can be standardized, modified over time, and reused. These scripts are essentially software applications that build infrastructure and are maintained much like a piece of software. They are versioned in GitHub and engineers patch the scripts or containers, not the hardware, and test those scripts again and again on multiple projects until they are perfected.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/08/01/logicworks1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4884" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/08/01/logicworks1.png" alt="" width="975" height="179" /></a></p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><em>An example of an instance build-out process with AWS CloudFormation and Puppet.</em></p> 
<p>In practice, infrastructure automation usually addresses four principal areas:</p> 
<li>Creating a standard operating environment or baseline infrastructure template in AWS CloudFormation that lives in a code repository and gets versioned and tested.</li> 
<li>Coordinating with security teams to automate key tools, packages, and configurations, usually in a configuration management tool like Puppet or Chef and Amazon &nbsp;EC2 Systems Manager.</li> 
<li>Delivering infrastructure templates to developers in the form of a self-service portal, such as the AWS Service Catalog.</li> 
<li>Ensuring that all templates and configurations are maintained consistently over time and across multiple environments/accounts, usually in the form of automated tests in a central utility hub that can be built with Jenkins, Amazon Inspector, AWS Config, Amazon CloudWatch, AWS Lambda, and Puppet or Chef.</li> 
<p>Together, this set of practices makes it possible for a developer to choose an AWS CloudFormation template in AWS Service Catalog, and in minutes, have a ready-to-use stack that is pre-configured with standard security tools, their desired OS, and packages. Your developers only launch approved infrastructure, never have to touch your infrastructure configuration files, and no longer wait a month to get new infrastructure. Imagine what your developers could test and accomplish when they’re not hampered by lengthy operations cycles.</p> 
<p>This system obviously has a big impact on system availability and security. If an environment fails or breaks during testing, you can just trash it and spin up another testing stack. If you need to make a change to your infrastructure, you change the AWS CloudFormation template or configuration management script, and relaunch the stack. This is the true meaning of “disposable infrastructure”, also known as “immutable infrastructure”—once you instantiate a version of the infrastructure, you never change it. Since your infrastructure is frequently replaced, the potential for outdated configurations or packages that expose security vulnerabilities is significantly reduced.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/08/01/logicworks2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4885" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/08/01/logicworks2.png" alt="" width="975" height="308" /></a></p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Example of AWS Service Catalog.</em></p> 
<p>This is why the work we do at Logicworks to automate infrastructure is so appealing to companies in risk-averse industries. Most of our customers are in healthcare, financial services, and software-as-a-service because they want infrastructure configurations to be consistently applied (and can prove that they are applied universally across multiple accounts to auditors) and changes are clearly documented in code. Automated tests ensure that any configuration change is either proactively corrected or alerts a 24&times;7 engineer.</p> 
<h3>Responsibilities and External Support</h3> 
<p>If you’re managing your own infrastructure, your operations team is responsible for everything up to (and including) the Service Catalog layer. Your developers are responsible for making code work. That creates a nice, clear line of responsibility that simplifies communication and usually makes developer and ops relationships less fraught.</p> 
<p>If you’re working with an external cloud managed service provider, look for one that prioritizes infrastructure automation. Companies that work with Logicworks appreciate that we have&nbsp; abandoned the old style of managed services. Long gone are the days when you paid a lot of money just to have a company alert you after something went wrong, or when a managed service provider was little more than an outsourced help desk. AWS fundamentally changed the way the world looks at infrastructure. AWS also has changed what companies expect from outsourced infrastructure support, and has redefined what it means to be a managed services provider. Logicworks is proud to have been among the first group of MSPs to become an audited AWS MSP Partner and to have earned the DevOps and Security Competencies, among others. We have evolved to continue to add more value to our customers and to help them achieve DevOps goals from the operations side—and not just to keep the lights on.</p> 
<p>Whether you outsource infrastructure operations or keep it in-house, the most important thing to remember is that you cannot create a culture that innovates at a higher velocity if your AWS infrastructure is built and maintained manually. Don’t ignore operations in your enthusiasm to build and automate code delivery. Prioritize automation for your operations team so that they can stop firefighting and start delivering value for your business.</p>

A next-generation MSP must have a deep understanding of their customers’ security and compliance needs and possess the ability to deliver solutions that meet these needs. This week we hear from APN Premier Consulting Partner, MSP Partner, and Competency Partner, Smartronix, on how they approach this for their customers.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Managed Security and Continuous Compliance:</h3> 
<h4>Next Generation Autonomic Event Based Compliance Management</h4> 
<p><em>By Robert Groat, Executive Vice President – Technology and Strategy at Smartronix</em></p> 
<p>One of the least understood and often overlooked benefits of deploying cloud services is the ability to transform and operationalize security compliance. This means that services native to the cloud can help assess, enforce, remediate, and report on security compliance semi-autonomously. Every action that affects any change in AWS, from the initial creation of the environment, to provisioning and deprovisioning resources, to changes made to even the most mundane setting are all affected via an API service call, and every API service call is logged and audited as an event.</p> 
<p>AWS has enabled native capabilities that allow you to respond programmatically to these events. In effect, you can use automation such as AWS CloudFormation and AMIs to create an environment that is compliant at creation, and thereafter can have an autonomic response to events to enable remediation, self healing, reporting, or systematic incident response capabilities. Essentially, our customers’ environments remain continuously compliant via programmatic management.</p> 
<p>Smartronix has been working in cooperation with AWS since 2008. Our initial infrastructure development efforts focused on creating reusable templates that incorporated security best practices, followed by a combination of proactive and reactive continuous monitoring, alerting, trouble ticket generation, and manual remediation. AWS Lambda, introduced in 2014, has been a key enabler for reaching the next level.</p> 
<p>Lambda is a serverless (0-management) solution that can connect events with algorithms written as Lambda functions. Once an event is identified as meaningful—for example, a boundary configuration change—we can write a Lambda function that executes automatically whenever the event occurs.</p> 
<p>The other key enabler is AWS Config, a native service that helps you continuously record, monitor, compare, and react to changes in your environment. We can now associate custom AWS Config rules with Lambda functions that enforce compliance. For example, if policy dictates encrypted root volumes, then we can monitor server launch events and enforce these policies automatically. If an attempt is made to create an instance with an unencrypted root volume, the action can be remediated by either&nbsp; quarantining or deleting the resource via the AWS Lambda function.</p> 
<p>Compliance actions can be reactive, such as when privileged account usage is identified, automatically verifying that an associated trouble ticket exists before authorizing the request. Other compliance actions can be scheduled. For example, certain rules can run every 24 hours to monitor license compliance, automate backups, or enforce tagging on deployed resources.</p> 
<p>Speaking of tagging, your nascent library of Lambda functions should automate, reinforce, and be advised by your tagging strategy. That tagging strategy should help you differentiate activities within your compliance functions. Smartronix refers to this process as Attribute-Based Service Management. Lambda compliance functions can then behave differently based on tags. An instance tagged “environment = development” may not need the same compliance remediation as one tagged “environment = production”. Bringing this strategy full circle, you can actually write Lambda functions that enforce a compliance policy dictating that all deployed resources must include a set of predefined tags.</p> 
<p>The high degree of flexibility that custom Lambda functions provide can also improve incident response and alerting when policy deviations occur. For Next Generation MSPs like Smartronix, this is an incredibly efficient way to manage multiple environments in a consistent and scalable manner. Although customers may have varying security and compliance requirements, we now have a framework enabled by AWS that helps us customize and respond in a repeatable, efficient manner.</p> 
<p>Combining AWS CloudTrail, AWS Lambda, AWS Config, the instrumentation ecosystem, and a source code control system like GitHub, organizations can now manage their software-defined security and compliance processes in the same way they manage their software-defined infrastructure. This improves reusability, reduces errors, ensures policy compliance, automates response, and reduces the typically onerous reporting burden. Your AWS Config Rules and AWS Lambda functions are now important parts of your security controls documentation and you now have a natural audit mechanism for proving how you enforce these controls.</p> 
<p>Smartronix is also extending this model into the areas of forensics, threat prediction, and log aggregation and analysis. Combining AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, and AWS Lambda with Amazon Machine Learning and Amazon AI has enormous potential to change the signal-to-noise ratio of complex and active environments, ensuring that the anomaly envelope is adaptive and that outliers are raised, assessed, and reincorporated into the growing, learning, adapting, intelligent security ecosystem.</p> 
<p>The availability of these tools and evolving experience is making NextGen Managed Services Providers highly competitive, if not superior, in entering a new opportunity space. Traditional MSPs have focused on IT service management, incident response, patch management, backup, and break/fix services. With software-defined infrastructure and now software-defined security and compliance, NextGen MSPs are blurring the lines between traditional Managed Service Providers and traditional Managed Security Services Providers. These new services, enabled by the cloud, include continuous monitoring, automated vulnerability scanning and analysis, automated boundary management, log aggregation and analysis, end user behavior analytics, and anomaly detection. At Smartronix, we are excited about disrupting the way enterprises view security and are democratizing services that at one time were the province of only a handful of the world’s largest enterprise companies.</p> 
<p>Smartronix has managed highly secure, large-scale global environments for more than 22 years. When we say you can achieve greater security in the cloud, you now have a better perspective on how we and other NextGen Service Providers achieve it. You can choose to replicate how you manage on-premises environments in the cloud, but true transformational value occurs when you rethink your approaches that can make use of the newest, most powerful, and innovative services available to you.</p>

<p>AWS Marketplace now has an IoT discovery webpage that makes it easier for you to buy IoT software from popular software vendors that’s integrated with, or running on, AWS Cloud services. This page features 17 IoT software providers.</p> 
<p>IoT is a complex industry represented by connected devices and the data they produce, supported by a variety of interrelated technologies across hardware and software platforms. The IoT value chain consists of several categories, including hardware (sensors, edge devices, gateways), connectivity, cloud and infrastructure, applications, and professional services. The IoT space is growing at a rapid-fire pace, and presents a nearly overwhelming selection for customers who want to find the right products to integrate into their AWS IoT projects. Customers look to AWS Marketplace for IoT software solutions, and the new IoT discovery webpage will help them make sense of the fragmented environment of products and software by placing these services in one easy-to-find location.</p> 
<p>AWS Marketplace is a sales channel that software companies use to offer software solutions to AWS customers. You can easily find and buy software as a service (SaaS) products, Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), or AWS CloudFormation template-based software deployments from popular software vendors. The software solutions listed on the IoT discovery webpage integrate with AWS IoT or other AWS services, and are billed to the customer’s AWS account rather than being billed by the vendor.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/26/Screen-Shot-2017-07-26-at-9.31.31-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4845 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/26/Screen-Shot-2017-07-26-at-9.31.31-AM.png" alt="" width="1810" height="950" /></a></p> 
<p>AWS Marketplace vendors offer over 60 products with IoT use cases, across networking, security, database, business intelligence, and other categories. The AWS Marketplace IoT discovery webpage helps customers select the right products faster by showcasing products within the following subcategories, to reduce the time and resources required to discover, procure, and implement an IoT project:</p> 
<li><strong>Edge, gateway, and connectivity</strong>: Includes software to manage data ingestion, device certificates/security, edge processing on the gateway, and global connectivity.</li> 
<li><strong>Development tools</strong>: Offers solutions to help partners and customers build best-in-class applications, reducing the friction developers face today when building IoT applications.</li> 
<li><strong>Data analytics and machine learning</strong>: Offers solutions to turn data into meaningful information to support business insights and outcomes.</li> 
<p>Today’s featured partners who have earned the AWS IoT Competency include Eseye, Bsquare, ThingLogix, Splunk and Bright Wolf.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Pinacl is a Consulting Partner that leveraged the AWS Marketplace IoT selection to deliver IoT services quickly to Newport City Council, in Wales.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>“ConnectThing.io on AWS Marketplace made it possible for Pinacl to very quickly launch a smart city proof of concept for Newport that is powered by AWS,” says Mark Lowe, strategic relations director at Pinacl. “If you’re setting up infrastructure the traditional way, in phase one, you have to set up to handle thousands of sensors when you might only want to start with 10. Using ConnecThing.io on AWS meant Newport could start small with very little investment or risk and figure out which projects delivered the most value.”</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“Our experience in dealing with industrial IoT deployments across a number of market segments shows data is the primary determinant in achieving the business outcomes our customers seek,” said Dave McCarthy, Bsquare Senior Director of Products. “By making DataV Discover available in AWS Marketplace, businesses can quickly determine IoT use cases that their data will support, thereby reducing risk and maximizing the probability of success.”</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Now, you can more easily navigate, discover, and purchase the software and services needed as we &nbsp;build successful IoT solutions and applications to fuel innovation and their business.</p>

<p>In today’s world of technology dependencies, ensuring your application’s messages reach the intended recipients is critical. That’s why some of the largest and most successful software-defined organizations such as Airbnb, Spotify, Uber, and Yelp rely on SendGrid as their customer communication platform for their most valuable email.</p> 
<p>Unlike most high-growth tech start-ups, SendGrid was born in the data center. Following the company’s launch in 2009, it built a high-performing and highly scalable private, internal cloud, achieving cost-efficient price-to-performance and four-hour server deploy times. Despite this, SendGrid chose to&nbsp;aggressively expand their relationship with AWS as their single, strategic cloud partner. Important factors in this decision included the business and marketing advantages of the AWS Partner Network (APN), AWS Marketplace, and the technology enablement advantages derived from elastic capabilities and managed services. So we are excited to officially announce SendGrid is joining the AWS family as an APN Partner and customer.</p> 
<h3>Inside SendGrid’s Expanded Relationship with AWS</h3> 
<p><em>By JR Jasperson, Chief Architect at SendGrid, an APN Technology Partner</em></p> 
<p>I am excited to unveil two related blockbuster projects we’ve been working on for a long time. The first is a robust, expanded relationship with AWS. At SendGrid, we have been running many critical workloads with many cloud providers – including AWS – for many years. However, through our relationship with AWS, we will be deepening and broadening our collaboration and aggressively expanding our footprint with AWS. Below, we’ll share additional details into why, and what this will mean for our customers.</p> 
<p>The second announcement is that we’ve been quietly working on a complete re-&shy;architecture of our mail processing pipeline for more than a year, and will roll these changes out throughout the remainder of 2017. While worthy of its own blog post, the new architecture was created and intended from day one to lay the groundwork for the SendGrid-AWS relationship. Our new pipeline is truly cloud-&shy;native and designed from the ground up to run optimally on AWS. In so doing, we’ve avoided several pitfalls that have beset other mail providers, so it’s helpful to tell both stories to highlight the advantages of AWS that we will be passing along to our customers.</p> 
<h4>Some Background</h4> 
<p>When SendGrid was founded in 2009, we created the notion of a transactional Email Service Provider (ESP)—sometimes referred to as a Cloud Mail Transfer Agent (MTA). Over the years, we have developed unique expertise at solving for the interesting and unique challenges that arise from serving an incredibly high volume (we surpassed the <a href="https://sendgrid.com/blog/celebrating-sending-1-trillion-emails/?utm_source=aws_apn_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_content=partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 trillion emails sent mark in March 2017</a>), multi-tenant SaaS email delivery platform. Many of these challenges are unique to this sector, when running in a cloud environment such as the AWS Cloud. Experience with single-tenant and/or on-premise solutions is only a fraction of what it takes to be successful as a true Cloud MTA.</p> 
<p>At SendGrid we strive to live by our <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/oliver-leung/the-four-hs-of-sendgrid_b_8317016.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4 H values</a>: Humble, Honest, Hungry and Happy and to be unwavering champions for our customers. So we’re proud that our customers put more value on our differentiators: <a href="https://sendgrid.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CINC_CaseStudy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ease of use</a>, <a href="https://sendgrid.com/solutions/sendgrid-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simple integration</a>, <a href="https://sendgrid.com/email-delivery/?utm_source=aws_apn_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_content=partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deliverability</a>, <a href="https://sendgrid.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Foursquare_CaseStudy-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proven availability</a>, <a href="https://sendgrid.com/solutions/high-volume/?utm_source=aws_apn_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_content=partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scalability</a>, and <a href="https://sendgrid.com/solutions/high-volume/?utm_source=aws_apn_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_content=partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">performance</a>—we feel that these numbers speak for themselves.</p> 
<h4>Why Now?</h4> 
<p>The adage “success lives at the intersection of preparation and opportunity” immediately comes to mind while considering the question of “why become an APN Partner now”? In our case, preparation meant re-&shy;architecting to a cloud-native platform. Two examples immediately stand out to illustrate why we viewed this as a prerequisite.</p> 
<li>Email is delivered through a store-&shy;and-&shy;forward mechanism which naturally implies statefulness in the system. As other “Cloud MTAs” have discovered, stateful compute is a poor fit for the cloud as it erodes many of its advantages. This is why we have decoupled state from our MTAs in the new architecture which allows us to take full advantage of AWS’ compute elasticity.</li> 
<li>In regards to IPs, deliverability is a measure of how many emails dispatched by a sender actually arrive in the recipient’s inbox as intended. It is perhaps the most important metric for an Email Service Provider. Surprisingly, deliverability is arduous to maintain, and one area in which SendGrid especially excels. Deliverability is not only highly dependent on the reputation of the specific IP address from which a given email is sent, but can also be negatively impacted due to bleed&shy;-over effects from dubious activity or poor reputation from other IPs in the same subnet. This is why SendGrid controls the entirety of the subnets from which we send and have ensured this will always remain the case as we transition additional workloads into AWS. We’ve spent years cultivating our IPs, and the 50,000 plus paying customers who use these IPs are a testament to their viability. Our move to AWS takes into account that reputations are hard to build and easy to destroy, hence why we will retain full control of all of our IPs during and after our move to AWS. Surprisingly, this is not the case with all “Cloud MTAs.”</li> 
<h4>Customer Advantages</h4> 
<p>With much of the prep work now behind us, we are well positioned to turbocharge our mission to become the world’s most trusted communication platform—our relationship with AWS has been born not of necessity, but opportunity. While the most commonly-&shy;cited benefits of AWS certainly apply in our case, I’ll skip these well&shy;-covered facets and instead highlight several that are more nuanced to a Cloud MTA and most importantly how we expect our customers to benefit from these advantages.</p> 
<li>For years, SendGrid has maintained distributed Points of Presence (PoPs) around the globe to quickly respond to API and SMTP requests. The performance and responsiveness of these PoPs is a function of their proximity to our customers. We will be leveraging AWS’ immense global reach to create additional PoPs in many AWS regions, further reducing latency and increasing throughput for our customers.</li> 
<li>Running a high&shy;-scale Cloud MTA requires near real-&shy;time analysis of a massive flow of data behind the scenes—challenges that require stream processing and machine learning technologies. We manage the infrastructure for these systems today, which naturally require overhead to build and maintain. Leveraging AWS capabilities such as Amazon Kinesis Streams, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Machine Learning will enable us to do more faster, allowing us to spend more time developing features for our customers.</li> 
<li>The ability to visualize or deeply analyze facets of messaging campaigns (such as deliverability by recipient domain or click/open rates of A/B tests) is critical to maximize the value that SendGrid provides to our customers. Supporting and continuously enhancing these capabilities represents a non&shy;trivial engineering challenge for SendGrid  due both to our substantial volume (finding and associating discrete events in an enormous sea of data) and providing the flexibility necessary to meet diverse requirements. AWS offers a number of analytics capabilities such as Amazon Athena, Redshift, and AWS Data Pipeline that we have already begun to explore as more efficient and advanced ways for our customers to use SendGrid to optimize their messaging.</li> 
<p>We will be leveraging AWS to allow us to focus on delivering even more value to our customers at an accelerated rate. While we’ve already been working on these projects for quite some time, we know these are just the first steps in an exciting journey— if you haven’t already, come join us and help shape the <a href="https://www.sendgrid.com/?utm_source=aws_apn_blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_content=partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">future of messaging</a>!</p>

<p>This month, Juan Villa, Pratap Ramamurthy, and Roy Rodan from the Emerging Partner SA team highlight a few of the partners they work with. They’ll be exploring Microchip, Domino, and Cohesive Networks.</p> 
<h3>Microchip Zero Touch Secure Provisioning Kit, by Juan Villa</h3> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/24/600x400_microchip_Logo.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4808 size-medium alignleft" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/24/600x400_microchip_Logo-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>AWS IoT is a managed cloud platform that enables connected devices to easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices. In order for devices to interact with AWS IoT via the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, they must first authenticate using Transport Layer Security (TLS) mutual authentication. This process involves the use of X.509 certificates on both the devices and in AWS IoT. A single certificate contains a private and a public key component. An IoT device needs to store the private key that corresponds to its certificate in order to establish a TLS connection with mutual authentication.</p> 
<p>Private keys can be somewhat difficult to store securely on IoT devices. It’s easy to simply store data on a device’s local memory, but this is not enough to protect the key from tampering. It’s quite easy, and affordable, to purchase the necessary hardware to read the content of the memory from most microcontrollers and memory components used on IoT devices. This means that private keys used for authentication and establishing trust need to be stored in a secure manner.</p> 
<p>This is where a secure element chip comes in! Microchip, an APN Advanced Technology Partner, is a silicon manufacturer that makes a secure element chip called the ATECC508A. This chip has a hardware-based secure key storage mechanism that is tamper-proof. In fact, once a key is stored in the ATECC508A, its contents cannot be read. The chip accomplishes this with hardware-based cryptographic acceleration features that allow it to perform cryptographic operations very quickly and with power efficiency. When considering ATECC508A for your product, keep in mind that Microchip can preload certificates on the secure element during manufacturing, before delivery. Combining this feature with AWS IoT’s support for custom certificate authorities and just-in-time registration can streamline device provisioning and security.</p> 
<p>To make this secure element chip easy for you to try out, Microchip makes an evaluation kit called the <a href="http://www.microchip.com/promo/zero-touch-secure-provisioning-kit-forAWSIoT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zero Touch Secure Provisioning Kit</a>. This kit includes a SAM G55 Cortex-M4 microcontroller, the ATECC508A secure element, and an ATWINC1500 power-efficient 802.11 b/g/n module, and comes with instructions on how to get started with AWS IoT. With this combination of silicon products you can begin testing and developing your next IoT product in a secure fashion.</p> 
<p>Before you work on your next IoT project, I recommend that you consider a secure element in your design. For more information on ATECC508A, please read the <a href="http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-8923S-CryptoAuth-ATECC508A-Datasheet-Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">datasheet</a> on the Microchip website.</p>

<h3>Domino Data Science Platform, by Pratap Ramamurthy</h3> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/24/Domino.png"><img class="wp-image-4809 size-medium alignleft" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/24/Domino-300x122.png" alt="" width="300" height="122" /></a>Machine learning, artificial intelligence, and predictive analytics are all data science techniques. Data scientists analyze data, search for insights that can be extracted, and build predictive models to solve business problems. To help data scientists with these tasks, a new set of tools, like <a href="http://jupyter.org/install.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jupyter notebooks</a>, as well as a wide variety of software packages ranging from deep learning neural network frameworks, like <a href="http://mxnet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MXNet</a>, to <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CUDA drivers</a>, are becoming popular. Data science as a field is growing rapidly as companies increase their reliance on these new technologies.</p> 
<p>However, supporting a team of data scientists can be challenging. They need access to different tools and software packages, as well as a variety of servers connected to the cloud. They want to collaborate by sharing projects, not just code or results. They want to be able to publish models with minimal friction. While data scientists want flexibility, companies need to ensure security and compliance. Companies also need to understand resource how resources like data and compute power are being used.</p> 
<p>Domino, an APN Advanced Technology Partner, solves these challenges by providing a convenient platform for data scientists to spin up interactive workspaces using the tools that they already know and love e.g., Jupyter, RStudio, Zeppelin, as well as commercial languages like SAS and Matlab, as seen in the diagram below.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/24/Domino2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4811 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/24/Domino2.png" alt="" width="595" height="488" /></a></p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Image used with permission</em></p> 
<p>In the Domino platform, users can run experiments on a wide variety of instances that mirror the latest <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EC2</a> options provided by AWS, as seen in the screenshot. Customers can run a notebook on instances with up to 2 TB of RAM with the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/x1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS X1 instance family</a>. If more computational power is needed, you can switch the same notebook to GPU instances as necessary or connect to a Spark cluster.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/24/Domino3.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-4812 alignright" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/24/Domino3.png" alt="" width="375" height="281" /></a>Because the software used for data science and machine learning has several layers, and new software technologies are introduced and adopted rapidly, the data science environment is often difficult to deploy and manage. Domino solves this problem by storing the notebooks, along with the software dependencies, inside a Docker image. &nbsp;This allows the same code to be rerun consistently in the future. There is no need to manually reconstruct the software, and this saves valuable time for data scientists.</p> 
<p>Domino helps data scientists share and collaborate. They have introduced the software development concepts of code sharing, peer review, and discussions seamlessly into the data science platform.</p> 
<p>For companies that have not yet started their cloud migration, <a href="https://www.dominodatalab.com/aws-data-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Domino on AWS</a> makes data science an excellent first project. Domino runs entirely on AWS and integrates well into many AWS services. Customers who have stored large amounts of data in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon S3</a> can easily access it from within Domino. After training their models by using this data, they can easily deploy their machine learning model into AWS with a click of a button, and within minutes access it using an API. All of these features help data scientists focus on data science and not the underlying platform.</p> 
<p>Today, Domino Data Science Platform is available as a SaaS offering at <a href="https://www.dominodatalab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Domino website</a>. Additionally, if you prefer to run the Domino software in your own virtual private cloud (VPC), you can install the supporting software by using an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS CloudFormation</a> template that will be provided to you. If you prefer a dedicated VPC setting, Domino also offers a managed service offering, which runs Data Science Platform in a separate VPC. Before considering those options, get a quick feel for the platform by signing up for a <a href="http://trial.dominodatalab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free trial</a>.</p>

<h3>Cohesive Networks, by Roy Rodan</h3> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/24/1-16-2015-Cohesive-Networks-Logo.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-4814 size-medium" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/24/1-16-2015-Cohesive-Networks-Logo-300x72.png" alt="" width="300" height="72" /></a>Many AWS customers have a hybrid network topology where part of their infrastructure is on premises and part is within the AWS Cloud. Most IT experts and developers aren’t concerned with where the infrastructure resides—all they want is easy access to all their resources, remote or local, from their local networks.</p> 
<p>So how do you manage all these networks as a single distributed network in a secure fashion? The configuration and maintenance of such a complex environment can be challenging.</p> 
<p>Cohesive Networks, an APN Advanced Technology Partner, has a product called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00THF20J8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VNS3:vpn</a>, which helps alleviate some of these challenges. The VNS3 product family helps you build and manage a secure, highly available, and self-healing network between multiple regions, cloud providers, and/or physical data centers. VNS3:vpn is available as an <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Machine Image (AMI)</a> on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Marketplace</a>, and can be deployed on an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EC2</a> instance inside your VPCs.</p> 
<p>One of the interesting features of VNS3 is its ability to create meshed connectivity between multiple locations and run an overlay network on top. This effectively creates a single distributed network across locations by peering several remote VNS3 controllers.</p> 
<p>Here is an example of a network architecture that uses VNS3 for peering:</p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/24/cohesive2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4815" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/24/cohesive2.png" alt="" width="975" height="321" /></a></p> 
<p>The VNS3 controllers act as six machines in one, to address all your network needs:</p> 
<li>Router</li> 
<li>Switch</li> 
<li>SSL/IPsec VPN concentrator</li> 
<li>Firewall</li> 
<li>Protocol redistributor</li> 
<li>Extensible network functions virtualization (NFV)</li> 
<p>The setup process is straightforward and well-documented with both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcpOm09hko4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how-to videos</a> and detailed <a href="https://cohesive.net/dnld/Cohesive-Networks_VNS3-4.0-Configuration.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">configuration guides</a>.</p> 
<p>Cohesive Networks also provides a web-based monitoring and management system called VNS3:ms in a separate server, where you can update your network topology, fail over between VNS3 controllers, and monitor your network and instances’ performance.</p>
