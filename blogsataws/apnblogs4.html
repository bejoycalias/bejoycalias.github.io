<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/20/Onica-logo-300x150.png">Onica</a>&nbsp;and announced a strategic shift to focus exclusively on Amazon Web Services (AWS) solutions.</p> 
<p>Onica joined the AWS Partner Network (APN) in 2013 and quickly became a Premier Consulting Partner. The company has since completed more than 400 AWS engagements and now boasts over 150 AWS certifications with customers spending more than $100 million a year on the cloud.</p> 
<p>Customers like TrueCar have <a href="https://www.onica.com/case-study/truecar/">migrated critical systems to AWS</a> in a matter of months with the help of Onica’s consultants—while driving down costs with a pay-as-you-go infrastructure rather than owning, operating, and maintaining their own data centers.</p> 
<p>“We needed outside experts to help us build the cloud platform we wanted to build, and Onica was the right choice,” said David Giffin, SVP of Technology at TrueCar. “We had developers and engineers from Onica in our office working side-by-side with our teams to help us learn and understand how to leverage the AWS ecosystem.”</p> 
<p>Onica is led by CEO Stephen Garden, who transformed CorpInfo from a legacy consulting company into an industry-leading cloud advisory firm. Onica has been a regular on the Inc. 5000 list of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies and in 2017 was named a CRN Triple Crown Award Winner.</p> 
<p>“The CorpInfo-Onica story is a great example of how an APN Partner is accelerating cloud adoption for our customers,” says Terry Wise, AWS Global Vice President of Channels and Alliances. “The new company reflects the team’s single-minded focus on helping customers succeed on AWS.”</p>

<p><em>By Alan Murphy, Technical Manager, Business Development at NGINX, Inc.</em><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/20/Quick-Starts_featured-300x150.png" /></p> 
<p>An update to the <a href="http://amzn.to/2jM035X">NGINX Plus on AWS Quick Start</a>&nbsp;includes full support for handling Auto Scaling events on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).&nbsp;We are pleased to&nbsp;share that staff from AWS Partner Network (APN) Partner NGINX, Inc., and Solutions Architects from Amazon Web Services (AWS) collaborated on the update.</p> 
<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2jM035X">See the NGINX Plus on AWS Quick Start &gt;&gt;</a></strong></p> 
<p>The NGINX Plus on AWS Quick Start uses customizable AWS CloudFormation templates to automate design, configuration, and setup tasks, and deploys NGINX Plus on AWS in less than 30 minutes. It’s designed to kick-start application migrations by deploying a turn-key NGINX Plus application delivery infrastructure.</p> 
<p>The updated AWS Quick Start enables you to spin up an entire NGINX Plus load-balancing and application delivery infrastructure with minimal effort, and demonstrates best practices when using NGINX Plus to manage application traffic on AWS.</p> 
<p>The update includes the following features:</p> 
<li>Nginx-asg-sync integration software, which monitors Auto Scaling groups, and adds or removes web application instances as necessary from the NGINX Plus environment, based on your configured settings</li> 
<li>Auto Scaling groups for the NGINX Plus instances, with configurable desired capacity, minimum size, and maximum size settings</li> 
<li>Auto Scaling groups for the NGINX web applications, with configurable desired capacity, minimum size, and maximum size settings</li> 
<li>Support for Auto Scaling policies for the NGINX Plus instances</li> 
<li>Infrastructure improvements, including Linux bastion hosts in an Auto Scaling group and enhanced AWS Quick Start portability</li> 
<p>While some features for Auto Scaling front-end traffic are available only in NGINX Plus, we have demonstrated in the AWS Quick Start how to manage application scaling with minimal cost by utilizing custom-built NGINX OSS images as the application images.</p> 
<p>This AWS Quick Start utilizes Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for NGINX Plus. Users will need to subscribe to the AMI before deploying the Quick Start.</p> 
<p>Get started by deploying the <a href="http://amzn.to/2jM035X">NGINX Plus on AWS Quick Start</a>, and see the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-reference/nginx/plus/latest/doc/nginx-plus-on-the-aws-cloud.pdf">Deployment Guide</a> for step-by-step instructions.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b>Business Sessions</b> 
<p><strong>Title: Cloud-Based Regtech Solutions on AWS</strong><br /> <strong>Session</strong> ID: GPSBUS209<br /> <strong>What You’ll Learn:&nbsp;</strong>With recent reports that banks face a regulatory change every 12 minutes, it’s no wonder firms increasingly look to automate compliance and reduce operational risk. By leveraging the latest technology advances—including cognitive computing, enhanced analytics, digital identities, big data, and the cloud—banks hope to reduce their compliance burdens and free human and financial capital for more productive uses. Today’s cutting-edge approaches offer advantages for agility, speed, and ease of integration. We dive deeper into the cloud-based RegTech solutions that are available on AWS.</p> 
<p><strong>Title: Evolve Your Storage Business Models on AWS</strong><br /> <strong>Session ID:</strong> GPSBUS217<br /> <strong>What You’ll Learn:&nbsp;</strong>Transitioning on-premises solutions to the cloud and creating SaaS solutions is no small undertaking. Providing unique, differentiated value, adjusting business models, and adroitly messaging your cloud-enabled solutions can set you up for long-term success. We’ll discuss the opportunities ahead for storage partners on AWS. How do you transform solutions to leverage the power of the AWS cloud? Will your operational paradigms shift as your customer deployment scenarios change? Can you help and advise customers as they navigate their own cloud transitions? Hear from on-premises and born-in-the-cloud partners as they discuss transforming their businesses on AWS.</p> 
<p><strong>Title: Refactor and Replatform .NET Apps to Use the Latest Microsoft SQL Server Release on AWS and Beyond</strong><br /> <strong>Session ID:</strong> GPSBUS220<br /> <strong>What You’ll Learn:&nbsp;</strong>Developers and architects migrating Microsoft enterprise applications to AWS can leverage new tools and services to implement DevOps best practices identified and developed by AWS solution architects and service teams. Learn about architectural best practices and AWS services such as AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodeDeploy, focusing on the .NET environment. Get examples of using the latest Microsoft SQL Server release on Amazon EC2 or Amazon RDS, or on other database offerings native to AWS such as Amazon Aurora or serverless environments. Hear how an APN Partner took a global retail customer’s e-commerce engine and Microsoft SQL Server-based data platform from on premises to the AWS Cloud in just weeks.</p> 
<p><strong>Title: Maximize Innovation and Agility by Building Your SaaS Solution on AWS</strong><br /> <strong>Session ID:</strong> GPSBUS215<br /> <strong>What You’ll Learn:&nbsp;</strong>Partners increasingly look to a SaaS delivery model for products to respond to customer demand, improve operational efficiency, increase agility, and expand market and global reach. AWS provides a low-cost, reliable, and secure foundation as you build and deliver SaaS solutions to customers. The AWS Partner Network (APN) helps you build a successful AWS-based business by providing valuable business, technical, marketing, and go-to-market support. We discuss what a typical journey to SaaS on AWS looks like, and explore the AWS and APN resources and benefits available to you at every stage of your journey.</p> 
<b>Technical Sessions</b> 
<p><strong>Title: SaaS Metrics: The Ultimate View of Tenant Consumption</strong><br /> <strong>Session ID:</strong> GPSTEC308<br /> <strong>What You’ll Learn:&nbsp;</strong>SaaS architects have their fingers on the pulse of tenant consumption. Understanding the patterns for tenant consumption provides both business and technical teams the data they need to make sound decisions about product packaging, metering, and tiering. Of course, building a robust model for analyzing and attributing tenant consumption can be tricky. We look at specific strategies for capturing, aggregating, and associating consumption with tenants in a multi-tenant, shared resource model. We’ll touch on common patterns and strategies that are used to instrument and publish metrics spanning compute, storage, and more, and we’ll look at tools and models that correlate consumption with AWS spend.</p> 
<p><strong>Title: Image Management Best Practices for Amazon WorkSpaces</strong><br /> <strong>Session ID:</strong> GPSTEC316<br /> <strong>What You’ll Learn:&nbsp;</strong>Desktop and application streaming solutions provide the “last mile” between users and their applications and data. We will review the elements and benefits of the layered desktop image, application dependencies, and lifecycle management of desktops. APN Partner Liquidware will showcase its toolset that helps customers deploy on AWS with ease. This deep dive on desktop image management for Amazon WorkSpaces will focus on enterprise organizations migrating to the cloud. It will benefit engineers and system administrators that are new to this space, as well as experienced architects with existing deployments on AWS.</p> 
<p><strong>Title: From Leaves to Lawns: AWS Greengrass at the Edge and Beyond</strong><br /> <strong>Session ID:</strong> GPSTEC317<br /> <strong>What You’ll Learn:&nbsp;</strong>AWS Greengrass provides a wide range of opportunities from IoT gateway applications to building systems like those with microservice architectures. We’ll evaluate how AWS Greengrass fits into OEM, ODM, and IT service delivery models. We then wade into a gentle overview of AWS Greengrass and how it interoperates with AWS IoT and other AWS services. We’ll walk through several key AWS Greengrass distributed architectures, and to help you accelerate your solution&nbsp;we’ll discuss how AWS Greengrass fits into the AWS Cloud development and delivery model. The session wraps up with a demonstration of AWS Greengrass facilitating communication between a closed machine to machine (M2M) network and AWS IoT.</p> 
<p><strong>Title: Optimizing Tips: Amazon Redshift for Cloud Data Warehousing</strong><br /> <strong>Session ID:</strong> GPSTEC315<br /> <strong>What You’ll Learn:&nbsp;</strong>Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud. A proper data model is an integral part of an optimal Amazon Redshift deployment, allowing you to scale efficiently in a cost-effective manner to meet your increasing demand. We offer tips to help you optimize your Amazon Redshift deployment.</p> 
<p><strong>Title: SAP HANA HA on AWS: Preventing Production Facepalms</strong><br /> <strong>Session ID:</strong> GPSTEC312<br /> <strong>What You’ll Learn:&nbsp;</strong>AWS provides a suite of services and tools to deploy business-critical SAP HANA workloads on the AWS Cloud. We discuss how to use AWS services, native SAP HANA high availability (HA) tools, and third-party software to achieve HA for SAP HANA systems on the AWS Cloud. We’ll review multiple options that use different AWS features, Availability Zones, and global regions, and then discuss the pros, cons, and related costs of each option.</p>

<p><em>By Tom Staab, Partner Solutions Architect at AWS</em></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/14/Microsoft-Competency-Icon-1-300x150.png" />This past week in Seattle, more than 5,000 people attended the annual PASS Summit conference, and AWS was well represented. Once again, AWS had a large booth in the exhibit hall, and hundreds of people stopped by over the three-day event. Several technical sessions provided insight for running Microsoft SQL Server workloads on Amazon Web Services (AWS), and the AWS Partner Network (APN) co-sponsored a breakfast with over 150 attendees.</p> 
<p>You may have read in Jeff Barr’s recent article on the AWS News Blog that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-microsoft-sql-server-2017-for-amazon-ec2/">Microsoft launched its SQL Server 2017</a>, which then became available on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in all regions shortly after. That means the latest version of Microsoft SQL Server is now available with the security, scalability, performance, and flexibility of Amazon EC2.</p> 
<p>Running Microsoft SQL Server 2017 on AWS enables you to benefit from its new features such as graph databases, automatic database tuning, and clusterless Always On availability groups. All of this while leveraging the high availability and disaster recovery capabilities of AWS with low latency connectivity between all AWS Availability Zones (AZs) .</p> 
<p>This is just one example of the many innovations that help customers run Microsoft SQL Server workloads on AWS. In May, AWS released a new Quick Start featuring <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/sios-datakeeper/">SIOS DataKeeper Cluster Edition</a> from Advanced APN Technology Partner SIOS, making it even easier to implement Microsoft SQL Server failover cluster instances on Amazon EC2. In August, the maximum storage capacity for Amazon Relationship Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances running Microsoft SQL Server was increased from 4 TB to 16 TB, and the potential IOPS was increased fivefold. And just last week, Amazon RDS for Microsoft SQL Server gained the ability to reconfigure the volume type and Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) upon snapshot restore.</p> 
<p>All Microsoft SQL Server versions integrate with AWS services including <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">Amazon CloudWatch</a> (to monitor operations and performance), <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/run-command/">Amazon EC2 Run Command</a> (to remotely manage instances), and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/">Amazon Elastic Block Store</a> (to take advantage of the persistent, performance, and reliable storage). This helps provide you with easy management, monitoring, and other administrative tasks.</p> 
<b>Learn More About Microsoft SQL Server on AWS</b> 
<p>For more information on how AWS services contribute to improved performance, security, and availability of Microsoft SQL Server applications, we invite you to join us at our <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/">AWS re:Invent 2017 conference</a>, November 27 through December 1 in Las Vegas.</p> 
<b>Leveraging the AWS Competency Program for Microsoft Workloads</b> 
<p>In July, we announced Microsoft SQL Server will be represented in a new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/aws-microsoft-workloads-competency-now-includes-database-solutions/">Database Solutions category</a> of our AWS Microsoft Workloads Competency. This allows customers to easily identify and engage the right APN Partners.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/">AWS Competency Program</a> is valuable to APN Partners as a way to demonstrate proficiency, and it is an important vehicle for customers to find APN Partners with the knowledge and experience they need. There are currently 12 APN Partners in the Microsoft Workloads Competency Database Solutions category, and several others have begun the approval process.</p> 
<p>We appreciate the dedication and hard work of our Microsoft Workloads Competency APN Partners and continue to look for Advanced and Premier APN Partners with experience implementing Microsoft SQL Server on AWS to join this elite group. Check out the AWS Microsoft Workloads Competency site&nbsp;if you are a customer or APN Partner looking to work with an APN Partner who has already earned the competency.</p> 
<b>Proven Success with Microsoft SQL Server Workloads</b> 
<p>The new&nbsp;Microsoft SQL Server launch means customers will be considering upgrades, and APN Partners that have earned the competency play an important role in helping you with these projects.</p>

<p><strong><em>By Judah Bernstein, Partner Solutions Architect at AWS focused on SaaS</em></strong></p> 
<p>Identity is a fundamental design decision that software as a service (SaaS) architects must consider when developing a multi-tenant system. Developers who are building SaaS applications must be able to identify a user, the tenant associated with the user, the user’s permissions, and the relationship a tenant has with the provider, such as usage plan or tier.</p> 
<p>In this post, I will explore how to architect a multi-tenant system and identify tenant context and role using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Amazon Cognito</a>, which lets you easily add user sign-up and sign-in to your mobile and web apps.</p> 
<p>I’ll first describe how to introduce tenant context into a multi-tenant application, and then define custom attributes and claims. Finally, I’ll present a few design considerations and show you how to take advantage of custom attributes within a multi-tenant system.<br /> <br /> </p> 
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/09/Amazon-Cognito-overview.png" /></a> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 1 – Amazon Cognito lets you focus on creating great app experiences instead of worrying about building, securing, and scaling a solution to handle user management, authentication, and synchronization across devices.</em></p> 
<br /> 
<p></p> 
<b>Introducing Tenant Context into Amazon Cognito</b> 
<p>To secure and isolate multiple tenants within a SaaS application, you must inject tenant context into applications or infrastructure. Tenant context may consist of a customer (tenant) identifier, usage plan, user identifier, and application role. This allows an application to programmatically adjust to the agreement with the customer, scope the access of resources to the corresponding customer, and constrain the customer to the permissions defined by the application role.</p> 
<p>You can inject SaaS applications with tenant context in myriad ways. One approach is to inject it into the token obtained following a sign-in to an identity provider. Amazon Cognito user pools provide you with an identity provider so you can introduce tenant context. This allows you to architect the application to be stateless, scalable, and secure.</p> 
<p>Amazon Cognito also lets you add user sign-up and sign-in to mobile and web applications with a dedicated login using custom credentials, such as an email address and password. User pools provide a cost-effective, secure, highly available, and durable user directory that stores a collection of user profiles with standard and custom attributes. You can define these attributes by using key-value pairs, and then use these attributes within the application or infrastructure to regulate access control and maintain tenant context.</p> 
<b>Standard Attributes and Claims</b> 
<p>Amazon Cognito has a set of built-in standard attributes that match the attributes provided by the <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims">OpenID Connect (OIDC) specifications</a>, such as <span style="font-family: courier">given_name</span>, <span style="font-family: courier">family_name</span>, <span style="font-family: courier">email</span>, and <span style="font-family: courier">birthdate</span>. These attributes are key-value pairs associated with a user profile.</p> 
<p>Standard attributes limit the independent software vendor’s (ISV’s) ability to meet the requirements of a multi-tenant system. For example, defining a tenant simply by their email domain may result in challenges if you’re supporting multiple business units within an enterprise organization, or may prohibit a subsidiary of an enterprise from obtaining access to tenant data.</p> 
<p>To bind tenant context, you should introduce custom attributes within the context of the authentication and authorization mechanism. Defining custom attributes within a user profile allows you to inject key-value pairs into an application, and supports the extensibility and identification of tenant context.</p> 
<b>JSON Web Token and Authorization Claims</b> 
<p>You can obtain tenant context by decoding key-value pairs that were injected into a secure authorization token, generated and signed by Amazon Cognito. This <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">JSON Web Token</a> (JWT) is issued and signed by a centralized server after a user is authenticated with their user name and password, as shown in <em>Figure 2</em>.</p> 
<p>The issued token’s key-value pairs are claims obtained from profile attributes, which include details of the issuing provider. This may include details on the identity such as the user’s <span style="font-family: courier">given_name</span>, and custom claims such as the defined key-value pairs.<br /> <br /> </p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/09/JSON-Web-Token-1.png" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 2 – JSON Web Token authentication and authorization flow.</em></p> 
<br /> 
<p></p> 
<b>Design Considerations for Using Custom Attributes (Claims)</b> 
<p>Claims let you customize and enrich the authorization and association of an identity within the context of an access token. You can use the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/CognitoIdentityServiceProvider.html">AWS Software Development Kit (SDK) for JavaScript</a> and write the required services to automatically provision a tenant, create a user with specific custom attributes, and integrate custom logic within the application to permit or deny requests based on these corresponding claims. <em>Figure&nbsp;3</em> illustrates how you can architect a SaaS application to incorporate claims for scoping tenant access.<br /> <br /> </p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/09/Obtaining-and-Verifying-Tenant-Context.png" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 3 – Obtaining and verifying tenant context.</em></p> 
<br /> 
<br /> In a multi-tenant application, a client application generally will pass the obtained ID token to a multi-tenant service. The service is responsible for decoding and parsing the token, and assessing the corresponding claims to verify the user and tenant context, as shown in 
<em>Figure 4</em>. By tying together multiple claims, you can address varied and often complex requirements for how the user is allowed to access an application or infrastructure. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/09/Authentication-and-Authorization-Workflow.png" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 4 – Steps for authentication and authorization.</em></p> 
<br /> 
<p></p> 
<b>SaaS Examples for Custom Attributes</b> 
<p>Developers can take various approaches to introducing custom attributes, identifying tenant context, and authorizing users within a SaaS application when using Amazon Cognito. You must understand the business requirements to determine the appropriate choice for your architecture.</p> 
<p>I’ve put together the following references to describe some of these approaches.</p> 
<h3>Example 1 – Introduction of Custom Attributes for Tenant Context</h3> 
<p>One common approach to enforce tenant isolation is to define multiple custom attributes, which, when combined, uniquely identify the entity, its permissions, and its associated tenant. A unique tenant identifier, a role to designate permissions (for a user), and a universally unique alphanumeric string of the identity give the application sufficient context to assess the identity in a multi-tenant environment. This approach may be extended with additional business logic, such as a usage plan that provides hierarchical layers of features or usage.</p> 
<p>A JWT token obtained following an authentication, as shown in <em>Figure 5</em>, might include four custom claims: tenant identifier (<span style="font-family: courier">tenant_id</span>), role (<span style="font-family: courier">role</span>), usage plan (<span style="font-family: courier">tier</span>) to determine the plan the tenant is subscribed to (free, standard, professional), and a universally unique identifier (<span style="font-family: courier">sub</span>) generated by the authorization server to uniquely identity the entity. In this example, you can integrate the required application code to assess the value within custom attributes, associate or generate the permissions required for the user, and provide the appropriate access.<br /> <br /> </p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/09/Amazon-Cognito-ID-Token.png" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 5 – Structure of the Amazon Cognito ID token with custom attributes.</em></p> 
<br /> 
<br /> Another example of this approach is when a user signs in to an application with their user name and password. The user is aware only of the functionality and data they have access to. They’re unaware that their tenant identifier is 
<span style="font-family: courier">4c7a2b201a57672bb748f821723d52c4</span>, their role is 
<span style="font-family: courier">TenantAdmin</span>, their tier is 
<span style="font-family: courier">Professional</span>, and their sub is 
<span style="font-family: courier">5b6a5bad-f59b-48ad-8f2d-9785d5a455b2</span>. 
<p></p> 
<p>Custom attributes provide a transparent approach to providing identity and isolation, which is handled by the application’s identity platform. If the user submits a request to create a product, the service is responsible for verifying the signature of the JWT token, decoding the token to obtain the corresponding claims, and invoking the expected micro-service methods or functions with the corresponding claims.</p> 
<p>Amazon Cognito user pools, when combined with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html">Amazon Cognito Federated Identities</a>, can match a role with a custom attribute, thereby associating a user who has a specific attribute with the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. You can combine multiple custom attributes into a hash or map, and then assign this value as the criteria for the claim match. This allows for various permutations that can be used to assess the permissions required for the identity.</p> 
<h3>Example 2 – Introduction of User Pool Group</h3> 
<p>Amazon Cognito user pools give an administrator the capability to add groups and associate users with groups via the console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or programmatically. Doing so introduces specific custom attributes (<span style="font-family: courier">cognito:groups</span> and <span style="font-family: courier">cognito:roles</span>, as described in <em>Figure 6</em>) that are managed and maintained by Amazon Cognito and available within the ID token.<br /> This approach simplifies the administration required for managing the required, mutable, and editable flags provided by the user pool’s custom attributes, by handing off the administration of these attributes to Amazon Cognito. In addition, user pools can associate a role with a group when combined with Amazon Cognito Federated Identities.<br /> <br /> </p>

<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 6 – Structure of the Amazon Cognito ID token with group attributes.</em></p> 
<br /> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Example 3 – Combination of User Pool Groups with Custom Attributes</h3> 
<p>In some scenarios, custom attributes might be necessary within an application context, but the manageability of role association to claim match doesn’t meet a developer’s requirements. In this scenario, it might make sense for you to use custom attributes for application context, but leverage the group association for the tenant context, roles, and policies.</p> 
<p>In <em>Figure 7</em>, John Doe is assigned to a group designated <span style="font-family: courier">GroupName</span>, has an association for the <span style="font-family: courier">ReadOnly</span> role, and has the custom attribute of <span style="font-family: courier">customer:tier : Professional Tier</span>. The role may be associated with the group through the Amazon Cognito association to simplify access management, but the custom attribute for the tenant usage plan may be maintained separately and without the need for additional permissions or a specific group.</p> 
<p>Amazon Cognito can support thousands of groups per user pool, and this model provides you with much-needed flexibility.</p> 
<p>By associating tenant-specific users that have shared custom attributes with a user pool group, you can use a hybrid approach to tenant isolation. You can then add custom logic into the application that is responsible for scoping the tenant-level access through the evaluation of the provided custom attributes. This approach to tenant-level security may be further solidified by associating users with tenant-specific groups or corresponding roles. This allows for a re-enforcement of tenant-level isolation for AWS resources by providing fine grained IAM access policies.<br /> <br /> </p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/09/Cognito-Token-ID-Custom-Attributes.png" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 7 – Structure of the Amazon Cognito ID token with groups and custom attributes.</em></p> 
<br /> 
<p></p> 
<h3>Example 4 – Introduction of User Pool Per Tenant</h3> 
<p>Multiple user pools provide a greater level of isolation between customers. This approach can be combined with the previous examples for additional flexibility. Providing one user pool per tenant is an acceptable approach to multi-tenancy and allows for customization of custom attributes per customer.</p> 
<p>In this scenario, if you have customers with unique requirements, each requirement can be met with minimal risk to the remaining tenants of the system. Note that the application must be developed with the appropriate programmatic and strategic approach to fit these requirements.</p> 
<p>There are some scalability considerations to evaluate in this design pattern, including AWS service limits, manageability of multiple user directories, and maintenance of application security. For more information about this model, see the Tenant Isolation Architectures whitepaper from AWS.</p> 
<h3>Example 5 – Maintaining a Multi-Tenant Identity Platform for SaaS Providers</h3> 
<p>This example targets ISVs who are interested in becoming multi-tenant (OpenID) identity providers, and allows you to consume the identity platform through customer-maintained Amazon Cognito user directories. As shown in <em>Figure 8</em>, an ISV can architect a solution in which tenants are SaaS providers that have tenants themselves.<br /> <br /> </p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/09/Identify-Platform-Hierarchal-Structure-1.png" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 8 – Example of a multi-tenant identity platform heirarchal structure.</em></p> 
<br /> 
<br /> An ISV can manage and maintain AWS accounts through the 
<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/CognitoIdentityServiceProvider.html">AWS SDK for JavaScript APIs</a> and 
<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html">roles for cross-account access</a>. You maintain control and administrative privileges to the Amazon Cognito user pools within your own account, but can choose to delegate the responsibility and overhead of identity management to the ISV. 
<p></p> 
<b>Considerations: Introducing Custom Attributes</b> 
<p>While the integration of custom attributes has significant benefits, there are some aspects developers should consider when architecting a multi-tenant system.</p> 
<p>You should carefully consider the impact of introducing mutable or required attributes into an environment. For example, if a third party is able to manipulate the <span style="font-family: courier">tenant_id</span> attribute, this change could disrupt the consistency and security of the system. Therefore, you should decide which custom attributes are required and configure these as non-mutable.</p> 
<p>Integrating permissions within the context of a user pool is important as well. If you introduce a custom attribute labeled <span style="font-family: courier">role</span> to maintain the permissions of a user within a tenant, you must define the attribute as mutable. This will be required to constrain the mutability of the attribute to approved users. SaaS architects commonly define a tenant administrator as the appropriate <span style="font-family: courier">role</span> and responsible <span style="font-family: courier">party</span> for maintaining tenant specific users and data.</p> 
<p>We recommend that you complete a competitive review of potential identity solutions before your development cycle. During this review, it’s important to ensure that solutions allow for the introduction and mutability of custom attributes and claims. This allows for long-term extensibility of the SaaS identity architecture.</p> 
<b>Next Steps: Identity with a Multi-Tenant Mindset</b> 
<p>To streamline the move to a secure and agile multi-tenant system, we recommend that developers minimize the complexity required to identify and manage tenant context. Amazon Cognito enables you to simplify, secure, and scale your architecture with custom attributes. Offloading the management of tenant context and user roles to custom attributes allows a business to focus on its product and go-to-market strategy.</p> 
<p>If you’re interested in understanding the design considerations for integrating custom attributes within a SaaS application, you can evaluate a SaaS reference architecture in real-time by deploying the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/saas/identity-with-cognito/">SaaS Identity and Isolation with Amazon Cognito Quick Start</a> within your AWS account.</p> 
<p>The Quick Start equips you with a full working solution that digs into the nuances of injecting tenant identity into SaaS applications. It addresses a broad range of identity topics and illustrates how tenant context is introduced via Amazon Cognito and used in combination with IAM to scope access to tenant resources.</p>

<p><strong><em>By Brett Moss, SVP and General Manager of Hyperscale Cloud at Ensono</em></strong></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/17/AWS-MSP-Program-300x150.jpg" />Looking back, October 2008 is as good a time as any to designate as the beginning of the first generation of mass adoption of the cloud.</p> 
<p>It was during that time that Amazon Web Services (AWS) removed the beta label from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) and officially provided a world of software developers with virtually unlimited storage and compute capacity, available on-demand and at low-cost. Those developers were off to the races—building more and more applications in the cloud, and taking advantage of the many features and services AWS began to add.</p> 
<p>That first generation overcame the challenge of thinking of infrastructure as code. They learned to stop thinking of compute instances as precious snowflakes that required extensive recovery plans, and they started thinking of them as disposable resources that could—and should—be shut down at the first sign of trouble, and then automatically rebuilt.</p> 
<p>The first generation of cloud adopters merged the practices of infrastructure automation and code deployment automation, so that the infrastructure running their apps was actually deployed by the frequent pushes coming from a code repository. They faced many challenges reckoning with the awesome power of AWS and pioneered cloud engineering in the process.</p> 
<p>If we want to point to the zenith of the first generation of cloud adoption, we could do worse than July 2011, when Netflix announced it had developed a set of tools (the Simian Army) that randomly terminated production compute instances during working hours in order to make sure engineers designed their use of AWS for fault tolerance and rapid, automated recovery. There’s nothing like taking off the training wheels to get the most out of auto scaling groups.</p> 
<b>The Next Generation</b> 
<p>The first generation of cloud adopters had a massive advantage over the mid-market and enterprise customers who came after them—their applications were born in the cloud. They did not have years, even decades, of legacy infrastructure running these new apps, so they were largely unencumbered to go “all-in” on AWS.</p> 
<p>Today, a new generation of companies is navigating a journey to AWS, and those companies have a very different set of challenges to overcome.</p> 
<p>Mid-market and enterprise customers embraced AWS as a viable execution venue for their workloads sometime around 2015, when Capital One and GE stood on the keynote stage at re:Invent and declared themselves all-in on AWS. Of course, there had been shadow IT and all sorts of testing and tinkering happening prior to then, but the data indicates later adopters only accelerated their movement to the cloud in the past three years or so.</p> 
<p>This next generation of adoption brings a new generation of challenges. At <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Ensono&amp;id=001E000001IPZ92IAH">Ensono</a>, an Advanced AWS Consulting Partner, our stock-in-trade is this set of challenges. We are a company built to work with mid-market and enterprise clients that were not born in the cloud and run production applications on myriad computing systems. Our clients simultaneously run bare metal servers, virtualized servers, company data centers, hosted systems, mainframes, and AWS. Our job, working with clients, is to make it all work together to achieve whatever outcomes they define as critical to their businesses.</p> 
<p>With extensive installed IT—called “technical debt” on a bad day and “legacy” on a good day—our clients cannot simply throw everything away and uproot to AWS overnight. They hold equipment and data centers as assets on their balance sheets; many of their applications are not ready to support the advanced capabilities of AWS; and their entire business depends on SAP estates that took 20 years to get fully tuned. Most do not yet have the in-house skills to stand up to the Simian Army randomly switching off their infrastructure.</p> 
<p>Let’s look at two examples we frequently encounter working with the new generation of AWS users.</p> 
<b>Enterprise Applications in the Cloud</b> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/14/MSP-Lifecycle-Square-300x300.png" />The first challenge we encounter concerns how to use AWS for enterprise applications. For our clients, these apps are the central nervous systems of their companies. The idea of making changes to SAP and Microsoft installations sends chills down the spines, but AWS provides a compelling option for these applications. We work with clients every day to migrate and operate in the cloud, minimizing disruption to their businesses.</p> 
<p>SAP customers are looking at how to make the transition to HANA after SAP stopped supporting other databases for its newest generation of business applications. Having spent many years honing the people, processes, and technology to make SAP deployments work the way they want, our clients are staring down the barrel of a wholesale database migration, and they have to do it without taking down the operations of their company. These clients are looking for any way to de-risk the process, and Ensono developed a dedicated practice around using AWS technology to assist clients in this transition.</p> 
<p>Our approach focuses on three outcomes: fast migration, reduced capital expenditures, and reduced operating expenses. To reduce the overall migration time, Ensono works with AWS in a Rapid Migration Methodology, a set of tools and best practices created by SAP and AWS that enables Ensono to help customers rapidly test migrations. Using this methodology, Ensono extracts and refactors database data to HANA format and deploys it into a test environment on AWS. In most cases, this can be done in a matter of days.</p> 
<p>Once the testing is validated, Ensono’s SAP architects work with our peers at AWS and with the client to deploy an architecture on one of 12 SAP-certified HANA AWS instance types, including the powerful x1e, one of the largest instance types available today. These instances are some of the most unique in the industry for their ability to support the extensive in-memory requirements of the HANA database, and they help save our clients the requirement to procure new and expensive hardware.</p> 
<p>Finally, once the SAP estate is in steady-state on AWS, we use our own cloud automation tooling to create ongoing economic efficiencies in the environment. For example, this might mean automatically turning on and off lower-level environments outside of business hours in order to reduce the infrastructure costs without compromising the availability of the SAP applications.</p> 
<p>With Microsoft migrations, we work with clients to use AWS technology to achieve a leaner, lower-cost operation. Taking MS SQL as an example, AWS’s unique approach to providing low-latency connectivity between Availability Zones (AZs) enables Ensono engineers to reduce the required number of compute nodes for a SQL deployment by a factor of up to one-third. Testing has demonstrated a very consistent latency of under 2ms between AZs in any AWS region.</p> 
<p>This means we can deploy an HA cluster with fewer nodes because we can use a two-node multi-AZ solution and forego the typical third node that would be required for DR. For .net shops, or clients running large SQL-specific apps like Dynamics, Biztalk, ERP, or those building data lakes on SQL, this ongoing cost reduction is considerable and does not come at the cost of compromised availability.</p> 
<b>Installed IT</b> 
<p>The final challenge we will discuss in this article is one that comes from clients with extensive and varied infrastructure systems in use. While the next generation of cloud adopters understand the many advantages of operating on AWS, they also understand that applications in their current forms may be most suited to a hybrid architecture.</p> 
<p>At Ensono, we think about this along two axes: the venue, and the application.</p> 
<p>To diagnose the most suitable venue for various tiers of an application, we use the paradigm of systems of record and systems of engagement. Because of Ensono’s strong pedigree managing mainframe and midrange infrastructure for large clients, we often work with companies running applications built for this kind of system.</p> 
<p>Looking carefully at those applications, Ensono engineers make recommendations involving parsing out the tiers of an app in order to achieve the financial, agility, or operational goals of the client. It may be that a system of record can stay on a mainframe until the mainframe keels over (which, we all know, will probably have a long life cycle.) But, the system of engagement—say, a mobile front end—is a prime candidate for the cloud.</p> 
<p>With architectural decisions in place, the client experience will largely depend on Ensono’s ability to communicate back to them in the language the matters most—that of the application itself. Regardless of the multiple types of infrastructure powering a workload, our job is to maintain the availability, security, and efficiencies of the app. In Ensono’s case, we achieve this using our own systems, collectively called Ensono M.O., that allow us to manage hybrid architectures through a single set of processes, automation, and reporting. For clients using AWS, M.O. connects directly into AWS and tools from APN Technology Partners that provide our clients the application-level view they require.</p> 
<b>Next Steps</b> 
<p>As AWS continues to disrupt the enormous base of installed infrastructure around the world, the next generation of adopters will use AWS tools, technology, and APN Partners to address their new challenges. They are not the same challenges faced by the first wave of born-in-the-cloud AWS users, but they are surmountable, and are being continually addressed so that companies can reap the benefits of the cloud.</p>
