<p><em>Learn how Financial Services partners like IHS Markit are using AWS to address financial regulatory requirements for financial risk management.&nbsp;</em></p> 
<h3>FRTB Regulation</h3> 
<p>New Basel financial risk regulations released in 2016 are transforming global bank risk systems.&nbsp;In January 2016, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published the <a href="http://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d352.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB)</a> standards, which introduced a new approach to evaluating risk across asset holdings, and will be mandated by 2020.</p> 
<p>The FRTB regulation establishes a new expected shortfall (ES) measurement of risk under stress, which replaces previous value-at-risk (VaR) based models for internally modeled assets.&nbsp;This ES measurement is expected to require a tenfold increase in calculations, in part due to the requirement that risk factor shifts be assessed over multiple time horizons based on their liquidity.&nbsp;Furthermore, FRTB mandates daily risk attribution and back-testing requirements as well as intra-day monitoring of risk exposures that may put pressure on existing platforms as computational needs increase.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, capital restrictions are driving banks to seek increasingly cost-effective solutions that provide the agility to keep pace with regulatory changes while keeping costs under control.</p> 
<p>In this post, we will explore some of the ways that the scalability and elasticity of the AWS Cloud are being used to support the need for large-scale financial calculations that may be required by many banks as they prepare to support FRTB and other financial risk requirements.</p> 
<h3>Key Changes to FRTB and their implications</h3> 
<p>A fundamental change from existing Basel 2.5/3 calculations is the use of more granular liquidity time horizons when determining risk via the Internal Models Approach (IMA).&nbsp;An asset held on a trading desk requiring IMA will now need profit and loss vectors at the risk factor level, with additional calculations aggregating time horizon permutations.&nbsp;Furthermore, the Standardized Approach (SA) to risk calculation is required even for desks using IMA.</p> 
<p>Another challenge comes with the required validation of IMA calculations against real-world economic impact.&nbsp;Banks will need to prove that internal models are within a strict tolerance, or risk being held to the more conservative SA capital requirement.</p> 
<p>These changes are estimated to require 10 times as many calculations for the average portfolio, which means that a significant increase in server capacity will be required to produce results in the expected timeframe.</p> 
<h3>FRTB Solution Suite from IHS Markit</h3> 
<p>One solution provider is taking a cloud-first approach to meet this challenge.&nbsp;IHS Markit, an Advanced Technology Partner and an APN Partner with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/financial-services/partner-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Financial Services Competency</a>, launched its FRTB Solution Suite to address the significant expansion of risk measures and more stringent modeling methodologies required by this regulation.&nbsp; The FRTB Solution Suite is a next-generation risk management platform that uses the scalable computational power provided by AWS.</p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/13/ihs1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4781" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/13/ihs1.png" alt="" width="975" height="654" /></a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Why Amazon Web Services?</h3> 
<p>When developing the FRTB Solution Suite, IHS Markit evaluated AWS and other prominent cloud providers. “AWS meets&nbsp;our needs in terms&nbsp;of&nbsp;scalability, affordability, security, and its track record of successful implementations,” says Andrew Eisen, managing director, global head of cloud strategy and hosting services, at IHS Markit.&nbsp;“Using AWS, we&nbsp;can&nbsp;instantly deploy&nbsp;capacity for&nbsp;risk scenarios&nbsp;and dynamically scale&nbsp;the system&nbsp;to account for the&nbsp;complexity and&nbsp;data&nbsp;volumes those&nbsp;scenarios demand,&nbsp;providing&nbsp;us&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;flexibility we need. Furthermore, being able to leverage a combination of reserved instances and spot pricing&nbsp;allows us to do so&nbsp;at a reasonable cost.” The FRTB Solution Suite uses AWS services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Auto Scaling, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to optimize its platform.</p> 
<h3>Scalable, Secure, and Cost Efficient</h3> 
<p>Although banks require more compute capacity to meet regulations like FRTB, capacity demand is not static.&nbsp;Risk calculations may spike overnight and in highly volatile markets, and may be moderate otherwise. Auto Scaling enables dynamic resource use by monitoring CPU and memory utilization to detect times when additional horsepower is needed, and turn it off when it isn’t.&nbsp; And because you only pay for what you use, costs are kept under control.</p>

<p>Assessing liquidity for an asset at the risk factor level requires mining petabytes of historical transactions and prices.&nbsp;IHS Markit selected Apache Spark for its analytics engine because Spark is a distributed processing system that scales horizontally and is optimized for high-performance processing of large datasets.&nbsp;To ensure that computation costs are optimized and to free up developers to focus on developing the business rules specific to FRTB risk, Amazon EMR was chosen to run and manage the Spark cluster.&nbsp;Amazon EMR offers increased speed and agility by automatically scaling to meet demand, adding nodes when performance is constrained, and removing nodes that are underutilized.&nbsp;Amazon EMR is also integrated with the Amazon EC2 Spot Instance market, which keeps costs to a minimum by accessing unused Amazon EC2 capacity at steep discounts relative to On-Demand Instance prices.</p> 
<p>IHS Markit wanted to ensure that their risk results were durable and available across Availability Zones, so the company chose Amazon S3 to store their risk data.&nbsp; They were able to take advantage of Amazon EMRs decoupling of storage and compute, by using Spark to query data directly in Amazon S3 without the need to load data into on-cluster HDFS.</p> 
<p>By operating Spark as a cluster using Amazon EMR, IHS Markit avoids the administrative complexity of capacity management, data security management, and software deployment.&nbsp;These capabilities enable IHS Markit to focus time and energy on delivering business value to its customers rather than the undifferentiated heavy lifting of operating foundational components at scale.</p> 
<h3>Summary</h3> 
<p>As Financial Services organizations are using AWS to simplify access to technologies such as big data analytics, high performance computing and deep learning, a qualitative change to addressing business needs has become possible.&nbsp;Capitalizing on this newfound elasticity and velocity, firms are able to respond to regulatory and customer needs at an unprecedented pace.&nbsp;IHS Markit’s FRTB Solution Suite demonstrates how organizations are taking advantage of these capabilities to solve key financial market drivers.</p>

<p><em>Post by Ian Scofield and Erin McGill</em></p> 
<p>We recently wrapped up a series (Parts <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/easing-the-creation-of-cross-account-roles-for-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/generating-custom-aws-cloudformation-templates-with-lambda-to-create-cross-account-roles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/collecting-information-from-aws-cloudformation-resources-created-in-external-accounts-with-custom-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/wrap-up-cross-account-role-onboarding-workflow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4</a>) on using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS CloudFormation</a> to ease the creation of cross-account roles during customer onboarding. It takes the reader through creating custom launch stack URLs for AWS CloudFormation, using an AWS Lambda function to generate a custom template with individualized parameters, and automatically sending the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the created cross-account role back to the SaaS owner. The process removes many of the manual steps involved in the creation of a cross-account role and the associated policy documents, reducing the chances of failure.</p> 
<p>Although this solution simplified the workflow and helped reduce failure rates during onboarding, there were still two areas open to improvement:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>We required the SaaS owner to customize each customer’s template and hardcode values. These templates needed to be stored, shared publicly, and then promptly deleted.</li> 
<li>The AWS CloudFormation wizard contained multiple pages, and partners told us they wanted to streamline this process.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>At AWS, we listen to our customers and partners to learn where we can improve, and our roadmap is almost exclusively driven by customer feedback. Based on the feedback we received on the customer onboarding process, I am pleased to announce that the AWS CloudFormation team has added the Stack Quick-Create Links feature which solves the issues we outlined above.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Embedding parameters in the launch stack URL – The AWS CloudFormation team has removed the need to store customized templates by adding the ability to embed parameter values directly in the launch stack URL.</li> 
<li>Streamlined launch stack wizard – Users will now be directed to an AWS CloudFormation wizard that has been reduced to a single page.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3></h3> 
<h3>Embedding Parameters in the launch stack URL</h3> 
<p>A <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/construct-your-own-launch-stack-url/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launch stack URL</a> makes it easy for customers to launch AWS CloudFormation templates by sending them straight to the AWS CloudFormation wizard with the template location and stack name pre-populated.</p> 
<p>As a refresher, the URL looks like this:</p> 
<pre>https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=<span style="color: #ff0000"><em>region</em></span>#/stacks/new?
stackName=<em><span style="color: #ff0000">stack_name</span></em>&amp;templateURL=<em><span style="color: #ff0000">template_location</span></em></pre> 
<p>In the scenario we outlined in our series, we used a launch stack URL to help customers launch an AWS CloudFormation template and create a cross-account role in their AWS account. The template associated with the URL contained unique, customer-specific values for the trusted account ID and external ID, and needed to be generated &nbsp;for each customer. The template was then hosted in an S3 bucket until the customer launched it. &nbsp;We also required a cleanup method to ensure that templates didn’t remain accessible post-launch. However, this process was burdensome on the partner and required additional infrastructure, including multiple Lambda functions and an S3 bucket, to execute.</p> 
<p>We discussed these challenges with the AWS CloudFormation service team, and they worked hard to resolve this problem and released a feature that lets you embed parameter values in the launch stack URL. This enables us to specify unique values for the trusted account ID and the external ID directly in the URL, which allows for the template to be generated on the fly. The partner no longer has to create, store, and ultimately delete the templates. In order to embed your parameters, just prepend the parameter name with&nbsp;<code class="lang-http">param_</code>&nbsp;followed by your&nbsp;<code class="lang-http">name=value</code>&nbsp;pair.</p> 
<p>The new syntax looks like this:</p> 
<pre>https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=<span style="color: #ff0000"><em>region</em></span>#/stacks/<em><span style="color: #ff0000">create/review</span></em>?
stackName=<em><span style="color: #ff0000">stack_name</span></em>&amp;templateURL=<em><span style="color: #ff0000">template_location</span></em>&amp;<em><span style="color: #ff0000">param_name1</span></em>=<em><span style="color: #ff0000">value1</span></em>&amp;<em><span style="color: #ff0000">param_name2</span></em>=<em><span style="color: #ff0000">value2</span></em>…</pre> 
<p>Here’s an example URL that we can use in our Cross-Account Role scenario:</p> 
<pre>https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=<span style="color: #ff0000"><em>region</em></span>#/stacks/<em><span style="color: #ff0000">create/review</span></em>?
stackName=<em><span style="color: #ff0000">stack_name</span></em>&amp;templateURL=<em><span style="color: #ff0000">template_location</span></em>&amp;<em><span style="color: #146eb4">param_ExternalId=abcd1234&amp;param_TrustedAccount=123456789012</span></em></pre> 
<h3>Streamlined Launch Stack Wizard</h3> 
<p>You may have noticed above that another part of the URL has changed.&nbsp; The&nbsp;<code class="lang-html">/stacks/new</code>&nbsp;part of the URL has changed to&nbsp;<code class="lang-http">/stacks/create/review</code>.&nbsp; This new feature streamlines the AWS CloudFormation wizard to remove additional pages for certain use cases. Every partner strives to make the onboarding experience as quick and smooth as possible to reduce the risk that the customer will abandon the onboarding process.</p> 
<p>Our earlier process required the customer to navigate through four separate sections, like this:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/13/cloudformation.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4763 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/13/cloudformation.png" alt="" width="882" height="688" /></a></p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 1: Traditional AWS CloudFormation launch stack wizard</em></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When you change&nbsp;<code class="lang-http">/stacks/new</code>&nbsp;part of the URL to&nbsp;<code class="lang-http">/stacks/create/review</code>&nbsp;in your launch URL, customers will be greeted by a single review screen that doesn’t require them to click <strong>Next</strong> on any pages. If there are any additional parameters that don’t need to be pre-populated, they will be present here as well for the user to fill out.&nbsp; All they need to do is click the<strong> Create</strong> button at the bottom of the screen.</p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/13/cloudformation2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4764" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/13/cloudformation2.png" alt="" width="993" height="749" /></a></p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Figure 2: Streamlined AWS CloudFormation launch stack review page</em></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As you can see, this drastically streamlines the process and enables a much quicker and smoother workflow for onboarding customers.</p> 
<p>Here’s an example URL that we can use in our cross-account role scenario to generate the screenshot in Figure 2:</p> 
<p><a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://s3-us-west2.amazonaws.com/isco/wizard.yml&amp;stackName=CrossAccountRoleSetup&amp;param_TrustedAccount=123456789012&amp;param_ExternalId=abcd1234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://s3-us-west2.amazonaws.com/isco/wizard.yml&amp;stackName=CrossAccountRoleSetup&amp;param_TrustedAccount=123456789012&amp;param_ExternalId=abcd1234</a></p> 
<p><em>Note: This feature doesn’t currently support NoEcho or password parameters for security reasons.</em></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Try it Out</h3> 
<p>With the addition of embedding parameters in the URL and the streamlined wizard, customers have a faster, smoother onboarding experience, and partners need less infrastructure to manage custom workflows.&nbsp; To learn more about these features, check out the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-stacks-quick-create-links.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS CloudFormation documentation</a>.</p>

Another area of new value that AWS MSPs can bring to their customers is management of their hybrid IT architecture, allowing customers at any stage of the cloud adoption journey to best leverage the AWS Cloud. This week we hear from Datapipe (APN Premier Partner, MSP Partner and holder of several AWS Competencies and AWS Service Delivery designations) as they discuss their approach and considerations in supporting their customers’ hybrid architectures.</p> 
<h3></h3> 
<h3>Unlocking Hybrid Architecture’s Potential with DevOps</h3> 
<p><em>By David Lucky, Director of Product Management at Datapipe</em></p> 
<p>Hybrid IT architecture, or what many customers call hybrid cloud, is increasingly prevalent in today’s fast-paced technology industry. Over the past few years, Datapipe has seen an initial reluctance towards cloud adoption transform into excitement, and hybrid architecture is emerging as a go-to solution for enterprise organizations looking for a way to manage their complex operations and run AWS as a seamless extension of their on-premises infrastructure.</p> 
<p>Hybrid architecture gives organizations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Application Programming Interface (API)</a> accessibility, providing developers with programmatic access to control their environments through well-defined methods. APIs, commonly defined as “<a href="http://searchmicroservices.techtarget.com/definition/application-program-interface-API" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other</a>,” are increasing in popularity in part due to the rise of cloud computing, and have steadily improved software quality over the last decade. Now, instead of having to custom develop software for a specific purpose, software is often written referencing APIs with widely useful features, which reduces development time and cost, and alleviates risk of error.</p> 
<p>With API accessibility, developers can easily repurpose proven APIs to build new applications instead of having to manage them manually. This gives them more room to experiment and innovate and creates a culture of curiosity. In this way, the API accessibility of hybrid architecture leads to a necessary rebalancing of development and operations teams looking to solve problems earlier and more automatically than was previously possible with purely on-premises solutions.</p> 
<p>To maintain the culture of curiosity that’s enabled by API accessibility through hybrid environments, we recommend organizations remove the silos that traditionally separate development and operations teams, and encourage open communication and collaboration – better known as DevOps. Implementing a DevOps culture helps organizations take advantage of a hybrid infrastructure to increase efficiencies along the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC). At Datapipe, we understand how critical the adoption of DevOps methodologies and agile workflows are for IT organizations to remain competitive and respond to the constantly evolving technology landscape. It’s the reason we expanded our professional services to include DevOps, and why we help organizations make the cultural switch to DevOps the right way, starting with people.</p> 
<h3>Individuals Over Tools</h3> 
<p>While many people conflate DevOps with an increase in automation tools, an organization can’t fully realize DevOps culture without starting with its people. A DevOps culture fosters open communication and constant collaboration between team members. It dissolves barriers between operations and development departments, giving everyone ownership over the SDLC as a whole, beyond their traditional, individual responsibilities. Being able to see the big picture allows team members to transition from being reactive to being proactive. That, in turn, involves shifting away from addressing problems as they arise to determining the root cause of the problem and finding a solution as a part of a continuous improvement mindset. Organizations that fully embrace this full-stack DevOps approach can provision a server in minutes instead of weeks, which is a vast improvement on the traditional SLDC model.</p> 
<p>This mindset also means moving from a reactionary approach and solving problems through “closing tickets” to a proactive approach that involves consistently searching for inefficiencies and addressing them in real-time, so an organization’s software is continually improving at the most fundamental levels. Of course, addressing inefficiencies in the software also means addressing inefficiencies in workflows, which leads to the use of DevOps tools such as automation and writing reusable utilities.</p> 
<p>However, productivity tools won’t increase efficiency on their own. An effective DevOps culture starts with open collaboration between team members, and then is reinforced by tools. At Datapipe, we see incorporating a DevOps culture through the lens of the “<a href="https://www.datapipe.com/blog/2017/04/07/why-a-personal-touch-is-still-important-even-with-the-rise-of-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agile Manifesto</a>,” which promotes “individuals and interactions over processes and tools.” When you combine agile working practices with DevOps, you can manage change in a feature-focused manner, providing faster interaction and response. Managing change in this way means that organizations achieve their goals through a strong DevOps culture that automates the majority of the overall development and delivery process, enabling teams to focus on areas that create a differential experience. This takes time – and collaboration among team members – to set up. The real-time collaboration that marks a full-stack DevOps approach reduces the number of handoffs in a SDLC, thus accelerating the entire process, and decreasing an applications’ time-to-market.</p> 
<h3>Looking Ahead</h3> 
<p>Hybrid architecture growth is expected to continue. <a href="https://www.idc.com/research/viewtoc.jsp?containerId=259840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Industry analyst firm IDC</a> predicts that 80 percent of all enterprise IT organizations will commit to hybrid architecture by the end of this year. This prediction is in line with what we’re seeing from our customers. As a next-gen MSP, we’ve seen an increase in enterprise companies looking for guidance on incorporating a DevOps culture to complement their digital transformations.</p> 
<p>Take our work with <a href="https://www.datapipe.com/about/case-studies/bmj-cloud-migration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">British Medical Journal (BMJ)</a>, for example. BMJ started out over 170 years ago as a medical journal. Now, as a global online brand, BMJ has expanded to encompass 60 specialist medical and allied sciences journals with millions of readers. As a result of their dramatic growth, their old infrastructure could no longer support their application release process. In addition, as an increasingly global organization, BMJ’s capacity for allowing downtime – scheduled or otherwise – was diminishing. To solve this problem, BMJ needed to move to a sustainable development cycle of continuous integration and automation, which is only possible through a shift to a DevOps type culture. We helped BMJ implement this culture while assisting with changes to their infrastructure. The switch to a more open, collaborative culture not only allowed BMJ to implement a sustainable development cycle, complete with continuous integration and automation, but it also made them feel better prepared to take their next planned step of moving workloads to the AWS Cloud and embracing a hybrid environment. (More about how we helped BMJ move to a DevOps-oriented culture can be found <a href="https://www.datapipe.com/about/case-studies/bmj-cloud-migration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>).</p> 
<p>If you’re interested in leveraging DevOps to get the most out of your hybrid environment, we recommend starting with the following considerations:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Leverage object-oriented programming principles</strong> such as abstraction and encapsulation to build re-usable and parameterized components that can be assembled like building blocks. This can be done in configuration management with Chef Recipes, Puppet Modules, and Ansible Roles, or through infrastructure building blocks like Terraform Modules and AWS CloudFormation scripts.</li> 
<li><strong>When automating infrastructure management</strong>, test destruction as deeply as the creation process. This will give you the ability to iterate and test cleanly.</li> 
<li><strong>Balance the effort</strong> being put into upfront engineering versus operational management activities. More upfront engineering unlocks some great features with Auto Scaling on AWS. For more steady-state applications, the resources needed to set up and configure can sometimes be much less than the effort of working through automation. This makes it worthwhile to look for open-source modules to help you in your infrastructure and configuration management workflows.</li> 
<li><strong>For Auto Scaling groups within AWS</strong>, consider, as you engineer your process, the time tolerances your workload has from the time when AWS detects the need for a new instance to when they are fully operational. Fully-baked Amazon Machine Images tend to be the fastest time to operational, but this would require building an image for every version of your application. Packer is a great tool for this purpose. In addition, the more you embed user data or configuration management processes, the longer your instance will take to reach an operational state. Finally, keep in mind processes like domain joins and renaming of instances, which require reboots, can add time to the launch process and use them as sparingly as possible.</li> 
<li><strong>For a low-latency link between your resources in and out of the cloud</strong>, consider taking advantage of higher-level services like AWS Direct Connect, which provides a virtual interface directly to public AWS services and allows you to bypass Internet service providers in your network path. Datapipe client ScreenScape used Direct Connect to link their on-premises environment to Amazon CloudFront for a cloud environment that’s highly available, fully managed, and able to scale over time with proven capability. (Learn more <a href="http://go.datapipe.com/case-study-screenscape.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Hybrid architecture offers organizations the power of both on-premises and cloud environments like AWS, giving them the tools to grow and innovate at a lower cost. For companies to fully capitalize on the benefits of these mixed environments, a culture change is necessary. By shifting to a DevOps culture and enabling teams to work together in a full-stack perspective, organizations can not only increase efficiency in their SDLCs, but also open up opportunities for immense engagement and creativity – qualities necessary for innovation. A next-generation MSP, with DevOps and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) capabilities, can be a valuable guide for IT teams on their hybrid cloud journey. At Datapipe, we pride ourselves on being a next-generation MSP, and our proficiency with DevOps was a key differentiator that led to our position as a leader in the <a href="https://www.datapipe.com/about/analyst-reports/gartner-cloud-msp-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Public Cloud Infrastructure Managed Service Providers, Worldwide</a>. By partnering with a next-gen MSP, like those included in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/msp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Managed Service Partner program</a>, organizations don’t have to make the shift to DevOps on their own.</p>

Today we are sharing a guest post from APN Advanced Technology and SaaS Partner, Datadog, as they address the shift from traditional to next gen monitoring and how these capabilities elevate the level of value that an MSP can deliver to their customers.</p> 
<p>Let’s hear from Emily Chang, Technical Author at Datadog.</p> 
<h3>Why Next-Generation MSPs Need Next-Generation Monitoring</h3> 
<p>To stay competitive in today’s ever-changing IT landscape, managed service providers (MSPs) need to demonstrate that they can consistently deliver high-performance solutions for their customers. Rising to that challenge is nearly impossible without the help of a comprehensive monitoring platform that provides insights into customers’ complex environments.</p> 
<p>Many <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next-generation MSPs team with Datadog</a> to gain insights into their customers’ cloud-based infrastructure and applications. In this article, we’ll highlight a few of the ways that MSPs use Datadog’s monitoring and alerting capabilities to proactively manage their customers’ increasingly dynamic and elastic workloads with</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Full visibility into rapidly scaling infrastructure and applications.</li> 
<li>Alerting that automatically detects abnormal changes.</li> 
<li>Analysis of historical data to gain insights and develop new solutions.</li> 
<li>Continuous compliance in an era of infrastructure-as-code.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Full visibility into rapidly scaling infrastructure and applications</h3> 
<p>As companies continuously test and deploy new features and applications, MSPs need to be prepared to monitor just about any type of environment and technology at a moment’s notice. Whether their customers are running containers, VMs, bare-metal servers, or all of the above, Datadog provides visibility into all of these components in one place.</p> 
<p>Datadog’s <a href="http://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/aws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integration for Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> automatically collects default and custom Amazon CloudWatch metrics from dozens of AWS services, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Elastic Load Balancing, and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). In total, Datadog offers more than<a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/product/integrations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 200 turn-key integrations</a> with popular infrastructure technologies. Many integrations include default dashboards that display key health and performance metrics, such as the AWS overview dashboard shown below.</p> 
<p style="text-align: center">&nbsp;<a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/10/Datadog0610.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4735" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/10/Datadog0610.png" alt="" width="859" height="617" /></a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>MSPs need the ability to monitor every dimension of their customers’ modern applications—as well as their underlying infrastructure. As customers continuously deploy new features and applications in the cloud, MSPs can consult a global overview of the infrastructure with Datadog, and then drill down into application-level issues with <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/apm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Application Performance Monitoring (APM)</a>, without needing to switch contexts. Datadog APM traces individual requests across common libraries and frameworks, and enables users to identify and investigate bottlenecks and errors by digging into interactive flame graphs like this one:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/10/Datadog20710.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-4736 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/10/Datadog20710.png" alt="" width="975" height="573" /></a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Infrastructure-aware APM gives MSPs full-stack observability for their customers’ applications, which is critical for troubleshooting bottlenecks in complex environments.</p> 
<h3>Alerting that automatically detects abnormal changes</h3> 
<p>Because today’s dynamic cloud environments are constantly in a state of flux, MSPs can benefit immensely from sophisticated alerts that can distinguish abnormal deviations from normal, everyday fluctuations. As customers’ infrastructure rapidly scales to accommodate changing workloads, what constitutes a normal/healthy threshold often will need to scale accordingly. Customers may also wish to track critical business metrics, such as transactions processed, which often exhibit normal, user-driven fluctuations that correlate with the time of day or the day of the week.</p> 
<p>Both of these scenarios explain why threshold-based alerts, while helpful for many types of metrics, are not ideal solutions for detecting more complex issues with modern-day applications. To accommodate these challenges, next-generation MSPs need a monitoring solution that uses machine learning to automatically detect issues in their customers’ metrics. Datadog’s <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/introducing-anomaly-detection-datadog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anomaly detection</a> algorithms are designed to distinguish between normal and abnormal trends in metrics while accounting for directional trends, such as a steady increase in transaction volume over time and seasonal fluctuations.</p> 
<p>Datadog also uses machine learning for <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/introducing-outlier-detection-in-datadog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outlier detection</a>—algorithms that determine when a host or group of hosts behaves differently from its peers. This effectively enables MSPs to make sense of how resources are being used within a customer’s infrastructure, even as it rapidly scales to accommodate varying workloads. Whenever an outlier monitor is triggered, MSPs can consult the monitor status page, like the one shown below, to quickly understand when the outlier was detected, and which component(s) of the infrastructure it may impact.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/10/Datadog30710.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-4737 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/10/Datadog30710.png" alt="" width="975" height="648" /></a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Analyzing historical data to gain insights and develop new solutions</h3> 
<p>As their customers’ environments scale and grow increasingly complex, MSPs need an effective way to visualize how all of those components change over time. For historical analysis, all data is retained at full granularity for 15 months. This allows MSPs to analyze how their customers’ infrastructure and applications have evolved and develop strategies that help them make strategic decisions going forward. In addition to visualizing AWS services and other common infrastructure technologies in default dashboards, MSPs can create custom visualizations that deliver deeper insights into their metrics. These visualizations include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Trend lines</strong>: Use regression functions to visualize metric trends</li> 
<li><strong>Change graphs</strong>: Display how a metric’s value has changed compared to a point in the past (an hour ago, a week ago, etc.)</li> 
<li><strong>Heat maps</strong>: Use color intensity to identify patterns and deviations across many separate entities. In the example below, a Datadog heat map shows Docker CPU usage steadily trending upward across a large ensemble of containers</li> 
</ul> 
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/10/Datadog40710.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4738" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/10/Datadog40710.png" alt="" width="721" height="239" /></a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Ensuring continuous compliance in an era of infrastructure-as-code</h3> 
<p>Infrastructure-as-code has revolutionized the way that organizations deploy new assets and manage their existing resources, enabling them to become more agile, continuously deploy new features, and quickly scale resources to respond to changing workloads. However, as these tools are more widely adopted, they also require organizations to monitor their assets more carefully, in order to meet compliance requirements.</p> 
<p>Datadog integrates with key infrastructure-as-code tools like Chef, Puppet, and Ansible to provide MSPs with a real-time record of configuration changes to each customer’s infrastructure. Datadog also ingests AWS CloudTrail logs to help MSPs track API calls made across AWS services and aggregates them in the event stream for easy reference. In the example below, you can see that CloudTrail reports any successful and failed logins to the AWS Management Console, as well as any EC2 instances that have been terminated—and who terminated them.</p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/10/Datadog50710.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4739" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/10/Datadog50710.png" alt="" width="975" height="340" /></a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With all of this data readily available, MSPs can track critical changes as they occur in real time and set up monitors to proactively audit and enforce continuous compliance of their customers’ AWS environments. They can also search and filter for specific types of changes in the event stream and then overlay them on dashboards for correlation analysis, as shown below.</p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/10/Datadog60710.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4740" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/10/Datadog60710.png" alt="" width="975" height="488" /></a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Event-based alerts help MSPs automatically detect unexpected changes and/or immediately notify their customers about events that may endanger compliance requirements. These alerts can also be configured to trigger actions in other services through custom webhooks. By making all of this information available in one central location, Datadog prepares MSPs with the data they need to respond quickly to compliance issues.</p>

<p><em>By Lee Atchison, Sr. Director of Strategic Architecture, New Relic</em></p> 
<p><em>This is a guest post from New Relic, an Advanced APN Technology Partner and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/migration/partner-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Migration Competency Partner</a>,</em></p> 
<p>When migrating applications to AWS, it doesn’t matter if you are rehosting, replatforming, or planning a full refactor—as you take each step, you should know what’s working. Above all, you need to know if the user &nbsp;experience of your migrated app is what you expect it to be—especially at that moment when the workload has moved and everyone is watching.</p> 
<p>How can you tell that a migration has successfully completed? How can you be sure that you haven’t introduced a problem or a looming concern into your application? How do you determine that you don’t need to do any further tuning or adjusting to ensure that your app that was previously running fine on premises is stable and performing well in the cloud?</p> 
<p>Ultimately, you can’t declare a migration successful until you’ve proven it works as expected in the new environment.</p> 
<h3>Defining Your Acceptance And Performance Goals</h3> 
<p>A big part of determining whether a migration has been successful or acceptable is to consider the user expectations, costs, and tolerances for application performance when the migration is complete. For example, the acceptance criteria for determining when a migration focused on cost reduction is complete might look something like this:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Response time to end users should be within 5% of pre-migration levels.</li> 
<li>Steady state (i.e., non-peak) server utilization should be within 20% of pre-migration levels.</li> 
<li>Steady state (i.e., non-peak) infrastructure costs should be reduced by at least 10% compared to pre-migration levels.</li> 
<li>Service error rates should be equal to, or lower than, pre-migration levels.</li> 
<li>Application availability levels and performance should meet or exceed pre-migration levels.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Your plan will differ, depending on your migration goals. For more critical applications, you may have more goals with tighter tolerances. For less critical applications, you may have fewer and more general goals. You may be migrating to serve spiky traffic loads more easily, to allow the creation of additional data centers, to reduce infrastructure management burdens, or even to gain access to higher-performing servers. Whatever your goals, your plan should:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Specify and quantify the desired improvements you expect from the migration.</li> 
<li>Identify other critical application metrics that you want to make sure remain acceptable and do not deviate a significant amount during the migration.</li> 
<li>Indicate that error rates and error types may not change significantly after the migration, to make sure that potential new errors have not been introduced into your system.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Make sure all the acceptance criteria goals you have established for yourself are goals that you can measure and monitor independently from any infrastructure. This is where New Relic comes into play. New Relic has a set of real-time monitoring capabilities that can measure the customer experience, code execution, and infrastructure behaviors that all report into a common platform. For example, in situations where you are moving a workload from an under-provisioned infrastructure to AWS, an improvement in user experience can be measured and proven. (see Figure 1)</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/07/Figure1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4724 size-full aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/07/Figure1.png" alt="" width="975" height="656" /></a></p> 
<p><em>Figure 1 – When moving from an under-provisioned legacy infrastructure to AWS, New Relic application performance monitoring (APM) clearly shows a measurable improvement in user experience.</em></p> 
<h3>Baseline Your End-User Experience and Application Performance</h3> 
<p>Once you’ve established your goals, you must measure the baseline performance of your application. This is critical for two reasons:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>During the migration, deviations from the established baseline can be early indicators of bugs or problems created during the migration.</li> 
<li>After migration, you’ll need the pre-migration baseline and your established goals to judge the success of the migration and help determine when it can be considered complete.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>What do you need to measure to create that baseline? The answer depends on your application and business needs, but typically covers applications and services, servers, and end-user experience – all measurable with New Relic:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>For end users:</strong> Time to glass performance, error rates, types of errors, browser-specific and mobile-specific performance, and latency from multiple geographic locations all need to be considered. Moving from a specific data center to a cloud-based infrastructure may impact individual users’ performance in different ways based on their locations. Tools such as <em><a href="https://newrelic.com/browser-monitoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Relic Browser</a></em>&nbsp;and <em><a href="https://newrelic.com/mobile-monitoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Relic Mobile</a></em> can help measure changes to the end user experience during a migration. Additionally, setting up synthetic user monitors using <em><a href="https://newrelic.com/synthetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Relic Synthetics</a></em> can capture data about specific types of user interactions with the back-end services being migrated.</li> 
<li><strong>For each application/service:</strong> Response time, error rates, types of errors, latency, and call rates are all important to see how the services perform on their new infrastructure, and to detect code-level problems introduced by the new environment. <em><a href="https://newrelic.com/application-monitoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Relic’s Application Performance Monitoring (APM)</a></em> is designed to help you measure this information so you can see how changes impact response times and errors in real time.</li> 
<li><strong>For each server:</strong> CPU, memory, load average during various usage scenarios (different traffic loads), and how they perform relative to different traffic, help you see how load is impacted with new server types and configurations. For these measurements, <em><a href="https://newrelic.com/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Relic Infrastructure</a></em> provides capabilities for measuring the performance of the servers running your application. This step is particularly important to monitor how effectively the new servers are being used by the migrated application.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>User experience is, by far, the most important aspect to preserve during a migration. Understanding how individual services work internally is important, particularly for identifying and resolving issues, but the end-user experience is the ultimate result you want to preserve. You will not be successful if your end-user’s experience is noticeably worse after the migration. Tools like <em>New Relic Synthetics</em> are especially valuable in determining if, and by how much, the end-user experience has changed.</p> 
<p>You may want to use <a href="https://newrelic.com/insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>New Relic Insights</em></a> to create a migration-specific dashboard that shows the specific metrics you are monitoring for your acceptance criteria. All the New Relic products mentioned above can feed data into dashboards created in <em>New Relic Insights</em>, which can present a single-page view of how your migration is advancing. But remember that such a dashboard is designed to present a high-level overview of your application performance. Don’t forget to drill down to the more detailed performance information within the individual products to determine how your application is performing during the migration.</p> 
<p>You may need to establish multiple baselines based on your application’s usage patterns. If it experiences usage peaks and valleys, you’ll want to establish baselines at multiple points and correlate to the specified usage patterns.</p> 
<p>This may seem like an excessive amount of performance information to collect, but changing the performance of a given service or system can impact the performance of the entire application and uncover hidden defects and faults that appear only under different conditions. You aren’t just changing the application’s performance, you may also be shaking loose existing bugs and shortcomings in your applications. That means you need to understand how the change impacts the performance of all the components in your system and all your users, as well as monitor for newly surfaced bugs and defects.</p> 
<p>For packaged applications that you do not directly control, you may not be able to get all the application/service-level performance and error information described above. For these applications, focus on end-user performance and server-level performance. Use tools such as <em>New Relic Synthetics</em> and <em>New Relic Infrastructure</em> to give you good guidance on the most critical aspects of how these pre-packaged applications perform in the cloud.</p> 
<h3>During the Migration</h3> 
<p>Once your baselines are established, you can begin the migration, applying the exact same monitoring tools to allow for apples-to-apples performance comparisons. Begin to add in cloud-specific monitoring capabilities (such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon CloudWatch</a>) as incremental improvements to your migration story and to assist in problem diagnosis.</p> 
<p>As the migration progresses, use your New Relic dashboards to keep an eye out for spikes in any of your critical performance metrics. Look for jumps where performance suddenly becomes, say, 20% worse than before. If you see any of these performance changes, immediately examine and determine the cause before moving to the next phase of the migration. Spikes and jumps are good indications of migration-related bugs or problems. Pay particular attention to error rates and response time values, as these are often the first indications of a problem.</p> 
<p>If you have not already done so, I recommend you assign individual services and capabilities—and the monitoring associated with those services and capabilities—to individual teams. It then becomes that team’s responsibility to make sure their specific services are properly functioning during the migration, and to resolve issues that occur. This may or may not be part of a formalized DevOps process, but certainly performing a cloud migration provides a perfect opportunity to begin instilling DevOps practices into your organization.</p> 
<p>During the migration, it’s important to prioritize migration-related issues at a higher level than new business requests. If you let a migration-related issue persist, you may lose visibility into the root cause of the issue. The issue could fester and cause more serious problems later. It is best to resolve the issues when eyes are on the problem and appropriate resolutions can be implemented.</p> 
<p>The discipline required to prioritize migration-related activities can be challenging, but it is essential to make sure the migration completes successfully.</p> 
<p>Don’t be afraid to undo a migration. If performance becomes unacceptable, don’t be afraid to back out the migration of a given service or module and reevaluate what’s needed before continuing. Implementing your migration using incremental steps helps limit the “blast zone” so it can be easily rolled back. This may not always be possible, but being able to quickly roll back changes should be a goal at every step.</p> 
<h3>Post-Migration</h3> 
<p>After you’ve moved your last service to the cloud, you’ll want to validate whether you’ve met your expectations and completed the migration. To do so, repeat the pre-migration baselining measurement process, examining your application using the same usage pattern times as you did before the migration.</p> 
<p>Finally, compare the new baselines to the pre-migration baselines. Some metrics will likely have improved while others may have degraded. Compare the results to your plan to validate that the changes meet your expectations. If they don’t, you have a couple of options:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Examine the deviations using your monitoring tools to determine the causes. If you’ve been doing this all along (as suggested above), you should already be aware of these issues.</li> 
<li>Determine if the deviation is acceptable to your business. You may decide that in the context of the overall improvements, a negative deviation in a specific metric is acceptable.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Your migration should be considered successful only after:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>All planned performance improvements have been validated in your new baselines.</li> 
<li>All (negative) performance deviations fall within planned acceptable levels.</li> 
<li>No unexpected migration-specific errors have been identified.</li> 
<li>Any remaining deviations from your plan can be explained and are deemed acceptable to your business.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Figure 2, below, shows an example dashboard with both pre- and post-migration data. Notice that some performance measurements have changed—some for the better and some for the worse. But if all your acceptance criteria goals have been met, or if you understand the deviations and can safely and knowingly live with them, you can safely consider the migration a success.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/07/Figure2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4725 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/07/Figure2.png" alt="" width="975" height="410" /></a></p> 
<p><em>Figure 2: New Relic services all use a common analytics platform that can sort, filter, analyze, and alert on the all the raw data you decide to collect. This dashboard compares apps running on an on-premises data center vs AWS infrastructures. Availability data comes from New Relic Synthetics, Error Rate and Response Times pull from New Relic APM, and CPU Utilization from New Relic Infrastructure.</em></p> 
<h3>What Can Go Wrong?</h3> 
<p>Even a simple lift-and-shift of a seemingly unchanged application to a new environment can introduce concerns and performance deviations than can torpedo a cloud migration. These issues can greatly extend the migration process or even require a rollback to pre-migration systems.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/07/Figure3.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-4726 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/07/07/Figure3.png" alt="" width="975" height="642" /></a></p> 
<p><em>Figure 3: Most services rely on connections to other services in some way. New Relic measures the individual transactions between every service.</em></p> 
<p>Here are some things to watch for:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Inter-service latency gets worse.</strong> (see Figure 3 above) Since you are moving services to a new environment, the expected latency between services is likely to change. Some values may improve, some may get worse. If a specific service-to-service latency gets significantly worse, it can trigger service availability problems and other errors.</li> 
<li><strong>Inter-service volatility</strong>. Even if inter-service latency isn’t significantly degraded, an increase in volatility can play havoc on your services and impact availability and error rates. It can also complicate future problem diagnoses. (see Figure 3 above)</li> 
<li><strong>Configuration changes.</strong> Even if you don’t plan to change your application, you’ll likely need to make some tweaks and adjustments to configuration values for the move to the cloud. These changes, even if you think they’re benign, can create hidden problems.</li> 
<li><strong>Server performance.</strong> The servers running your applications in the cloud may be faster or slower than your pre-migration on-premise servers—or their performance could be more variable than before. These server performance changes can reveal previously hidden defects in your application.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Even if your applications are stable and functioning normally in your existing environment, moving them to a new environment can introduce unknowns and uncertainty to your system. Detecting and resolving issues stemming from that uncertainty early in the migration process will make the migration smoother and more likely to be successful.</p> 
<h3>Moving Beyond The Migration</h3> 
<p>After the workloads have moved and deemed stable and performant, the expectations of how the cloud can help evolve your apps will rise. Similar to understanding the changes that occur during a migration, understanding the impact of the changes that occur is also critical to making the daily data-driven decisions on adopting new cloud services, code changes, and optimizing infrastructure. New Relic’s tools are designed to help you monitor your apps and infrastructure as you refactor and re-architect your apps on AWS.</p>

Let’s now hear directly from a few of our MSP Partners who have embraced this new ideology in managed services and who are enabling increasing levels of innovation for their customers.</p> 
<p>This is the first in a weekly series of MSP APN Partner guest posts that we will be publishing here on the APN blog this summer. Our partners will be sharing their expertise on critical topics that enable customers to embrace the AWS Cloud and more fully realize the business values that this allows them. Topics will include cloud automation, optimizing after migration, hybrid cloud management, managed security, continuous compliance, DevOps transformation, and MSPs as innovation enablers.</p> 
<p>Let first hear from Jeff Aden, Founder &amp; EVP Marketing and Business Development at 2nd Watch (APN Premier Partner, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/managed-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MSP Partner</a>, and holder of multiple AWS Competencies), as he discusses the importance of refactoring and optimizing workloads after migration to AWS and how a next gen AWS MSP Partner can deliver this value.</p> 
<h3>The Four Key Steps of Optimizing Your IT Resources, by Jeff Aden, Founder &amp; EVP Marketing and Business Development at 2nd Watch</h3> 
<p>The 2nd Watch team has been very fortunate to have the opportunity to help some of the world’s leading brands as they strategize, plan, and migrate their workloads to the cloud as well as support them in ongoing management of those workloads. I have worked with some of the foremost cloud experts within 2nd Watch, AWS, and our customers, and can share best practices and Four Steps to Optimizing your IT Resources that we have learned over the years.</p> 
<p>Optimization in the world of cloud requires data science, expertise in cloud products and, most of all, an understanding of the workloads that are supported by the infrastructure. We are not talking about a single application where anyone can provision a few instances. This is about large migrations and management of many thousands of workloads. Within that context, the &nbsp;sheer volume of choices in cloud products and services can be overwhelming, but the opportunities for digital transformation and optimization can be huge.</p> 
<p>Reaping maximum performance and financial optimization requires a combination of experience and automation. On average, we’ve been able to save our customers 42 percent more with our optimization services than if they managed their own resources.</p> 
<p>We see optimization in cloud typically driven by:</p> 
<h3>1. Migration to cloud</h3> 
<p>Typically this is the first step to optimizing your IT resources and the most common first step for many enterprises. By simply moving to the cloud, you can instantly save money by paying only for what you use. The days of old—where you bought IT resources for future use versus what you needed today—are over. This brings enormous savings in three areas: The time it takes you (IT) and the business in planning for future needs; the amount of space you need to own or rent to hold your data center along with all the logistics of operating a data center; and the cost of IT hardware and software, since you are not buying today for what you may use by 2020. The initial move can save companies between 40 to 60 percent over their current IT spend.</p> 
<p>All of this can be done by migrating to AWS without rewriting every application or making huge bets on large and expensive transformation projects. Customers like <a href="http://2ndwatch.com/resources/customers/yamaha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yamaha</a> have achieved savings of $500,000 annually, and <a href="http://2ndwatch.com/resources/customers/diane-von-furstenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DVF</a> racked up 60 percent savings on hosted infrastructure compared to a legacy provider. And, one of the most recognizable use cases is <a href="http://2ndwatch.com/resources/customers/conde-nast-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conde Nast</a>, which increased performance while saving 40 percent on operational costs.</p> 
<h3>2. Performance</h3> 
<p>This is an ongoing optimization strategy in the cloud. Auto scaling is probably one of the most widely-leveraged strategies for tuning performance in the cloud. It provides the ability for IT to add resources based on internal or external demand, in real time and with automation. Once you have your workloads in the cloud, you can begin to understand what your resources are really using and how to leverage auto scaling to save money and meet demand with both enterprise applications and consumer facing applications.</p> 
<p>However, in order to take advantage of auto scaling, you must first ensure that you have fine-tuned some of the basics to really increase performance. One way to do this is by ensuring that you have selected the correct instance type and type of storage. Another is to ensure your auto scaling is primed and ready to take the load. Customers can also &nbsp;purchase additional IOPS or replace Amazon EBS volumes as needed.</p> 
<h3>3. Financial</h3> 
<p>Optimization is probably the most intricate and ever-changing aspect of cloud computing today. An introduction of a new product or version can benefit customers dramatically but can also cause some headaches along the way. Often, we see prospects start with the financial optimization even before they have looked at migration or performance and how it weighs into the comprehensive financial mechanism a company uses to achieve an overall savings.</p> 
<p>We encourage clients to migrate their workloads and understand the performance needs prior to purchasing any Reserved Instances (for example) in order to maximize their resources and ROI. Clients should focus on getting some other foundational areas established first, like best practices for tagging organization-wide, visibility into the right reporting KPIs, and understanding the workload needs. Once this is achieved, we find that RIs can be a very effective way to save money and increase ROIs. Clients like <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-amazon-stole-motorola-from-microsoft-2016-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Motorola</a>, who took this approach have saved more and increased their ROI more than was possible with their legacy manage service provider.</p> 
<p>2nd Watch was built on cloud-native tools and leverages automation that allows for scalability. We manage more than 200,000 Amazon EC2 instances today and understand the complexity beyond the numbers. Behind our solutions for optimization is a team of experienced data scientists and architects that can help you maximize the performance and returns of your cloud assets.</p> 
<h3>4. Evolving to optimal AWS services</h3> 
<p>This is the next step in maximizing performance and achieving greater savings. Some companies elect to start by refactoring. While this is the right starting point for some companies, we have found—over many years and through many customer examples—that this can be challenging if customers are also trying to familiarize themselves with running on the cloud. The 2nd Watch proven methodology aligns with where clients are positioned in their journey to the cloud. If you take our approach, the company’s employees and vendors become immersed in the cloud and see it as the “new normal.” Once acclimated, they can explore and understand new products and services to propel them to the next level.</p> 
<p>Companies like <a href="http://2ndwatch.com/resources/customers/scor-velogica/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scor Velogica</a> saved an additional 30 percent on hosting and support costs by evolving their application in an SOC2 cloud native environment. <a href="http://2ndwatch.com/resources/customers/celgene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Celgene</a> reduced the time to run HPC jobs from months to hours by taking this approach. Not only do we preach this approach, we practice it before putting it into effect with clients. We moved off of Microsoft SQL to Amazon Aurora, increasing performance and capacity without increasing costs or risks. Other clients take it in steps and move to a product like Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) and experience savings on the operational side when they can clone a new database and save money, all without the administrative overhead of traditional IT.</p> 
<p>A hyper-scale AWS Managed Service Provider (MSP) partner like 2nd Watch can provide tested, proven, and trusted solutions in a complex world. Gartner has named 2nd Watch a Leader in its Magic Quadrant for Public Cloud Infrastructure Managed Services Providers, Worldwide report for its ability to execute and completeness of vision. <a href="http://offers.2ndwatch.com/Gartner-MQ-Cloud-MSPs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Access the report</a>, compliments of 2nd Watch, for a full evaluation of all MSPs included. With the right level of experience, focus and expertise it is not so cloudy out there.</p>

<p>For this month’s Partner SA roundup, AWS Partner SAs Juan Villa, Pratap Ramamurthy, and David Potes discuss three APN Technology Partners: Cloud Conformity, Kinetica, and Vault. Let’s dive in!</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Cloud Conformity, by Juan Villa</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/06/30/CloudConformity.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-4686 alignleft" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/06/30/CloudConformity.png" alt="" width="208" height="187" /></a>Have you ever wanted to have an always-available advisor who specializes in cloud operations? An advisor that can find opportunities to increase the security, reliability, performance, and operational excellence of your systems, while also helping you decrease costs? <a href="https://www.cloudconformity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloud Conformity</a> is a SaaS platform that does exactly this. They have built a continuous assurance tool that builds on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Well-Architected Framework</a>, as well as additional best practices, to provide you with detailed and accurate advice.</p> 
<p>Getting started is easy. All you have to do is <a href="https://app.cloudconformity.com/registration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create an account on their website</a>, and then follow the setup wizard. This wizard will instruct you to create a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cross-account role</a> in your AWS account to give Cloud Conformity read-only access to your resources. Cloud Conformity uses this information, along with over 250 rules, to drive the automated logic that powers the advisor and ultimately the recommendations they make to you.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/06/30/Compliance-Status.png"><img class="wp-image-4687 size-full alignnone" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/06/30/Compliance-Status.png" alt="" width="975" height="368" /></a></p> 
<p>You might be wondering how Cloud Conformity improves your security posture or provides you with recommendations to reduce cost. Let’s consider two examples. To see how they handle security, let’s say you’ve created a Linux-based EC2 instance and configured it with a security group that allows access to the SSH port from anywhere in the world. That’s probably the easiest way to get started, but it isn’t best practice from a security standpoint. Cloud Conformity’s engine constantly scans your account, taking into consideration all the configured rules. One of these is a rule to detect security groups that have broad open access to the Internet. When Cloud Conformity detects the insecure security group, it generates an alert to notify you, and even provides you with detailed steps on how to remediate this issue.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/06/30/Failure-Status.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4688 size-full" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/06/30/Failure-Status.png" alt="" width="975" height="118" /></a></p> 
<p>For our second example, Cloud Conformity can find opportunities for cost optimization in many areas.&nbsp; For example, it analyzes the usage of EC2 instances by using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, such as CPU usage, reported by the instance. As the administrator of the Cloud Conformity account, you can configure the usage thresholds that define a mostly idle instance, and Cloud Conformity will help identify oversized instances. It will even help you find possible cost saving opportunities by identifying instances that would benefit from Reserved Instance allocations!</p> 
<p>We’ve only scratched the surface of what Cloud Conformity can do. Cloud Conformity currently has over 250 rules in its engine, and this list is growing. They have detailed and thorough documentation and a very easy to use platform. I encourage you to check them out at <a href="https://www.cloudconformity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cloudconformity.com</a> and get started today!</p>

<h3>Kinetica, by Pratap Ramamurthy and Juan Villa</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/06/30/Kinetica.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4691 alignleft" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/06/30/Kinetica-300x57.png" alt="" width="300" height="57" /></a>Some applications generate rapid streams of information like Twitter feeds and equity trades. These streams can be stored and analyzed to derive insights at a later point in time. However, analyzing streams in real time and taking automated actions can provide much higher value to the business. Real-time analysis can be difficult though, due to factors such as the volume and size of the stream, scaling, and the dimensions of the data being analyzed; for example, in geospatial location analysis and advanced analysis like natural language processing (NLP).</p> 
<p>There are now new ways of using graphics processing unit (GPU) technology. While GPUs were originally intended for video rendering and gaming applications, their power can be harnessed for other tasks as well. A single GPU instance, such as the AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">p2.16xlarge</a> instance type, contains 16 NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs, each with 4992 NVIDIA CUDA cores and 24 GiB of on-board memory.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.kinetica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinetica</a>, is a GPU-accelerated, in-memory database for powering analytics workloads. It is designed to take advantage of the parallel processing ability of GPUs to provide low-latency, high-performance analytics on large datasets at rest or streaming. It makes processing of complex real-time data faster and easier on AWS and you can feed a real-time stream into a Kinetica database, and run SQL queries on the stream in real time. &nbsp;Kinetica integrates with several different data sources, as well as feeding various BI, GIS and other third-party applications for visualization and additional analysis.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/06/30/Kinetica-Diagram.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4689 size-full" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/06/30/Kinetica-Diagram.png" alt="" width="890" height="368" /></a></p> 
<p>With Kinetica, an orchestration layer with <a href="https://www.kinetica.com/docs/concepts/udf.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user-defined functions</a> enables organizations to develop sophisticated data science models on the same database platform they’re using for business analytics. This means that companies can bypass the arduous step of first transforming the data and moving it back and forth between a database and a separate data science system.</p> 
<p>Kinetica also provides a web-based visualization framework called <a href="https://www.kinetica.com/solutions/location-based-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reveal</a> that makes it easy and quick to explore geospatial data, as shown in the following screenshot.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/06/30/Kinetica-Page-2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4690 size-full" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/06/30/Kinetica-Page-2.png" alt="" width="800" height="431" /></a></p> 
<p>This framework also integrates with the Kinetica geospatial pipeline for advanced mapping and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX5KL3iN-n4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interactive location-based analytics</a>.&nbsp; With Kinetica, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and OLAP workloads can all now be performed from a single solution through C++, Java, Python, SQL, and your favorite point-and-click BI tool.</p> 
<p>I encourage you to check out Kinetica’s product on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00PMNLW2K" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Marketplace</a>. You can also read additional information on the features and benefits of Kinetica on AWS by reading their most <a href="https://www.kinetica.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/PartnerBrief_AWS_2.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent partner brief</a>.</p>

<h3>Vault, by David Potes</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/06/30/Vault.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4692 alignleft" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/06/30/Vault-300x103.png" alt="" width="300" height="103" /></a>Managing secrets in a cloud infrastructure presents new opportunities and challenges for developers and administrators who are looking to improve security by securing, storing, and tightly controlling secrets.&nbsp; With <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vault</a>, by Hashicorp, you have a powerful tool that tightly integrates with AWS to help administrators manage this infrastructure.</p> 
<p>Vault has a notion of auth backends, one of which they have developed specifically for authenticating to your AWS resources. This backend treats AWS as a trusted third party, which means, in most cases, that no pre-provisioning of security-sensitive credentials (e.g., tokens, passwords, client certificates) is necessary. It handles leasing, key revocation, key rolling, and auditing. Users can access an encrypted key/value store and generate IAM and AWS STS credentials.</p> 
<p>HashiCorp is an AWS standard partner and holds the DevOps competency, focusing on Configuration Management.</p> 
<p>It’s easy to give Vault a try! Check out the <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/#/demo/0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interactive tutorial</a> that HashiCorp provides, or use our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/vault/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vault Quick Start</a> to spin up an instance for yourself. If you’d like to learn more about how Fanatics, the online retailer for licensed sports apparel, uses Vault to secure their highly elastic AWS infrastructure, take a look at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kafXiaCdRw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webinar</a> I presented with Seth Vargo and Paulo Machado from HashiCorp.</p>

<p><em>A guest post by Datavail, an AWS Partner Network (APN) Consulting Partner and an AWS Microsoft Workloads Competency Partner specializing in database solutions. &nbsp;</em></p> 
<p>Through the AWS Competency Program, we’ve been validated by AWS for our proven expertise in offering applications and database solutions built on the Microsoft SQL Server platform on AWS. This includes data management and warehousing, business analytics, structured and unstructured database integration and operation, and ensuring a high degree of security and regulatory compliance.</p> 
<p>In this post, we would like to walk you through some of the benefits we have seen customers gain by running Microsoft SQL Server workloads on AWS. We will then provide a couple of real-life examples to illustrate our process for helping customers migrate SQL workloads to AWS.</p> 
<h4>Benefits of running Microsoft SQL Server on AWS</h4> 
<p>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) provides a fully managed database service that helps a customer instantly launch and configure a database server for immediate use. The following are just a couple of features that make Amazon RDS for Microsoft SQL Server very attractive:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Automated backups</li> 
<li>Point-in-time recovery</li> 
<li>Implement High Availability through a multi-availability zone (AZ) deployment.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The alternative to running Amazon RDS SQL Server instances is to run Microsoft SQL Server on an Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance. This option can help you leverage the various instances and storage types offered by AWS. Additional benefits include:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Full control: Complete control over settings and configurations just like on-premises instances.</li> 
<li>Elastic and on-demand: You can increase or decrease capacity in minutes, commission one of hundreds of instances automatically, and power on and off instances as you need to meet demand.</li> 
<li>Reliability and security: Amazon EC2 Service Level Agreement (SLA) commitment is 99.95% availability for each AWS Region. Plus, AWS has data centers and network architectures to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations, which means that most, if not all, of your security compliance requirements will be met.</li> 
<li>High availability plus performance plus disaster recovery: Yes, it can be done! With careful planning and architectural design, your Microsoft SQL Server instances can meet high availability, performance, and disaster recovery requirements at the same time. For example, you can configure a Microsoft SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Group with one primary node for production workload, one secondary node for read-only routing to offload reporting requirements, and a third node for disaster recovery.</li> 
</ul> 
<h4>Datavail’s Process for Migrating Microsoft SQL Server to AWS</h4> 
<p>When clients seek assistance with migrating their complex environments to AWS, we initiate a detailed discussion to best understand the timeline, requirements, and steps involved in the migration process. We conduct an initial assessment, prepare a migration plan, and then meet with the client to review the details, challenges, and steps involved. We also help clients determine the optimal approach- Amazon RDS or Amazon EC2- to meet their SAQL Server needs.</p> 
<h4>Case study: Migrating Sony DADC NMS to AWS</h4> 
<p>Sony DADC NMS New Media Solutions (NMS) specializes in the delivery of digital media from the content provider to the end user (the content consumer). The company’s core mission is to deliver best-in-breed, secure, and innovative supply-chain solutions for their customers throughout the world. Users of Sony DADC NMS include many major motion picture studios, television broadcasters, radio broadcasters, online content portals, music labels, game companies, and software providers.</p> 
<p>The company’s database environment is inherently complex. Its content is multi-source and multi-channel, and can consist of structured and unstructured data, including text, images, audio, and video. According to Sony, its <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sony-dadc-new-media-solutions-transforms-cloud-based-distribution-through-launch-of-venue-unlimited-300319279.html">content management system</a> “provides a predictable, scalable, and flexible approach to more quickly and efficiently deliver media services to audiences,” and “significantly reduces security exposure by ensuring the lowest number of possible touchpoints of valuable assets.”</p> 
<h4>Sony DADC NMS Moves to Cloud as Ven.ue</h4> 
<p>In 2016, Sony DADC decided to make its content available in the cloud under the name “Ven.ue.” Datavail, which has DBAs with deep expertise in AWS Cloud technologies, was contracted by Sony to implement the Microsoft SQL Server-related tasks, including planning, testing, and executing.</p> 
<p>A task list was prepared for Datavail with several milestones. The following steps were included in the migration process:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Installing and configuring Microsoft SQL Server 2014</li> 
<li>Provisioning AlwaysOn Availability Groups</li> 
<li>Migrating the database</li> 
<li>Establishing a performance baseline</li> 
<li>Conducting AlwaysOn Availability Group failover testing</li> 
<li>Completing the final migration</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Offloading the reporting workload from the production database proved to be one of Sony DADC’s biggest challenges. We addressed these challenges by using AlwaysOn Availability Groups and read-only routing. Sony DADC NMS and Datavail conducted weekly meetings and work sessions to discuss any open items, roadblocks, and the next action items for this project.</p> 
<p>Our expertise with Microsoft SQL Server and AWS helped Sony DADC NMS accurately scope, plan, troubleshoot, and execute each task within this project. Additionally, as a result of this project, we can now support customers using Sony DADC NMS who want to migrate to AWS, and can also support AWS customers interested in the benefits of Sony DADC NMS as a content warehouse solution.</p> 
<h4>Case study: Teamwork at Mammoth Mountain Ski Area</h4> 
<p>Mammoth Mountain Ski Area turned to Datavail and AWS to meet their high availability needs for the SQL Server deployment and to offload reporting functions to AWS. Datavail replicated their databases from an on-premises server to AWS for reporting and high availability. The publisher and distributor reside on an on-premises Microsoft SQL Server instance, and the subscriber is located on SQL Server instances running on EC2 instances. To further increase redundancy and availability, there’s an additional SQL Server instance running on Amazon EC2 as a warm standby server for the subscriber instance. This unique setup enables high availability as well as off-loading the reporting needs to the subscriber running on an Amazon EC2 instance.</p> 
<p>Off-loading reporting minimizes the contention and performance impacts on the production OLTP server. In addition, the SQL Server instance running on an Amazon EC2 instance serves as a warm standby server for disaster recovery.</p> 
<p>Architecting and supporting the hybrid model of SQL Server instances running on-premises and on AWS is a team sport. The systems, network, and DBA teams must work very closely together to ensure a successful outcome. Communication and collaboration between the systems, application, and DBA teams are paramount. For example, service pack and hot fix rollouts and any maintenance activities require all teams to be on the same page on timing, so they can notify the business units in advance, coordinate on technical tasks and responsibilities, and schedule interval updates to the business stakeholders.</p> 
<h4>Case study: Moving a major education provider to AWS</h4> 
<p>This case study involves the migration of Microsoft SQL Server to AWS for an international education provider. The company works with high schools, colleges, and universities all over the world. The company’s rapid growth presented unique challenges such as over-provisioning Microsoft SQL Server instances, insufficient monitoring and alerts, and inadequate or non-existent disaster recovery and high availability solutions.</p> 
<p>The education company had 12 data centers they wanted to consolidate. The IT team was spending too much time dealing with alerts and troubleshooting problems to enable them to focus on IT as a competitive asset, and had created an infrastructure to handle peak loads that was unused most of the time.</p> 
<h4>Checklist for Microsoft SQL migration to AWS</h4> 
<p>We assessed the company’s system and helped put the following migration plan into motion:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Provisioning EC2 instances</li> 
<li>Provisioning Amazon RDS instances for Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL</li> 
<li>Provisioning Auto Scaling and load balancing for Amazon EC2 instances</li> 
<li>Implementing redundancy at every stage to reduce single points of failure</li> 
<li>Implementing best practices in scalability and security</li> 
<li>Configuring Amazon CloudWatch to help collect and track usage metrics and manage alarms</li> 
<li>Configuring Amazon Route 53 to move traffic to nearest Availability Zone</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The result was a significant consolidation and integration of their IT infrastructure. By using Amazon RDS, the onsite DBA team can focus more on business-critical aspects of their databases and less on day-to-day enhancements. Elastic Load Balancing allows the company to move away from expensive and complicated load balancers. The company can optimize its resources by right-sizing its instances when utilization rates fall.</p> 
<h4>Case study: A fresh approach to database administration</h4> 
<p>The following example involves a multinational producer and marketer of fresh fruit and vegetables. When your inventory can spoil in a matter of moments—whether it’s left too long in the field or not sold to retailers in time—every second matters.</p> 
<p>The company was having problems with their data business. Their Microsoft SQL Server system performed poorly in part because they had no overnight support. They also lacked a testing environment for engineering a solution.</p> 
<p>After the assessment, the Datavail team set up a test environment, migrated Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon RDS, and decommissioned the test environment when it was no longer needed. We integrated 24x7x365 monitoring and aligned processes with best practices.</p> 
<p>Data was successfully migrated to AWS during scheduled maintenance windows. Alerts and tickets fell as database performance improved. Monitoring and managed services ensured that the company’s DBAs could sleep soundly at night and not have to react to alerts that were already addressed by Datavail DBAs when they arrive at work every day.</p> 
<h4>Conclusion: Moving SQL to AWS</h4> 
<p>If you are familiar with Microsoft SQL Server but new to AWS, Datavail’s experts can help assess, plan, and execute your move to the cloud. If you are familiar with AWS and want the benefits of running Microsoft SQL Server in that environment, our experts can help assess, install, test, and build out a system to handle your needs. We have experts on both services who can make the transition smooth and safe.</p>

<p><em>Introduction by Terry Wise, Global Vice President, Channels &amp; Alliances at AWS</em></p> 
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is changing the way companies collect, store, analyze, and take action from data through connected devices. AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has built IoT specific services</a>, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS IoT</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Greengrass</a> to help you simply and securely connect your devices to the cloud and allow you to act on the data (either in the cloud, on the connected device, or both) and provide the ability to manage your devices so you can focus on developing applications that fit your needs. To accelerate your IoT design, development, and deployment, we work with a robust APN Technology and Consulting Partner ecosystem that provides services and solutions which complement AWS services and help customers further take advantage of AWS for IoT.</p> 
<p>Today, I’d like to discuss three of our AWS IoT Competency Partners: Bsquare, Eseye, and ThingLogix.</p> 
<h3>Bsquare, an AWS IoT Competency Partner</h3> 
<p><strong>AWS Powered Applications to Improve Industrial Asset Uptime</strong></p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/06/27/600x400_bsquare.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4658 alignright" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/06/27/600x400_bsquare-300x200.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>What specific business outcomes are you looking to achieve through your industrial operations? And how can you improve your existing business processes and outcomes by harnessing the power of IoT? Bsquare, an Advanced Technology Partner and AWS IoT Competency Partner, aims to help you move your business forward and take it to new heights through the company’s DataV™ applications. How? Simply put, DataV applications are meant to help you optimize business processes through data-driven insights made possible by making your physical assets intelligent and well connected. Does that sound up your alley? Let’s learn more.</p> 
<p>“Bsquare’s DataV applications create business-focused IoT systems deployable in concert with AWS,” explains Dave Wagstaff, Bsquare Chief Technology Officer. “DataV helps businesses extract value from physical assets by using data to drive superior business outcomes. With it, businesses can connect remote devices, monitor data streams, automate corrective processes, predict adverse conditions before they occur, and, ultimately, optimize the performance of critical business assets and processes.” Bsquare has helped numerous industrial companies around the world, including <a href="https://www.bsquare.com/case-study/kenworth-case-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenworth</a> and <a href="https://www.bsquare.com/case-study/peterbilt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Peterbilt</a> (<em><a href="https://www.bsquare.com/resource-type/use-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find a number of additional case studies here</a></em>). DataV is optimized for deployment on the AWS Cloud and utilizes a broad range of AWS services that can include IoT Services (such as AWS IoT and Greengrass), Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, AWS Lambda, Amazon Machine Learning, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon Redshift, and additional services as customer solutions may require. “Utilizing AWS allows Bsquare to leverage the power, security and scalability of both core infrastructure as well as industry leading services groups such as IoT, Analytics and AI,” says Wagstaff. “By integrating DataV with AWS, Bsquare is able to focus on developing differentiated IoT applications and not worry about the heavy lifting associated with infrastructure and core services.”</p> 
<p>Are you ready to give Bsquare a try? <a href="https://www.bsquare.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reach out to the Bsquare team</a>, and they can help you start with a Proof of Concept or Application Pilot (which is often done with your existing data) to quickly validate outcomes and ROI with a solution utilizing AWS services and DataV applications. While Bsquare also offers SI services, the company engages with a wide range of Technology and Consulting partners who are actively working with customers who can benefit from a DataV solution. “Because DataV typically fits within a larger, enterprise wide solution, Bsquare works closely with partners, including ISVs, SIs and Consultants, to deliver an integrated solution,” says Geoff Goetz, Bsquare Senior Director of Alliances.</p>

<h3>Eseye, an AWS IoT Competency Partner</h3> 
<p><strong>Technology for Connectivity</strong></p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/06/27/600x400_eseye.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4659 alignright" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/06/27/600x400_eseye-300x200.png" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>Are you looking for a simplified way to securely connect and quickly scale your IoT device&nbsp;deployments globally? Eseye, with its goal to secure IoT from manufacturing to deployment and throughout the device lifecycle, is here to help. “Eseye’s day-by-day mission is to support our customers’ business growth by delivering managed global IoT device cellular connectivity: we aim to offer the most comprehensive and supported way businesses can deploy and scale cellular IoT today,” explains Damian McCabe, Eseye’s GM, Americas. So what is the Eseye solution, exactly? “The Eseye AnyNet Secure SIM is an enhanced and robust global roaming cellular connectivity solution, exclusively for IoT machines. AnyNet Secure SIM provides AWS IoT customers with enhanced security and connectivity features that enables IoT devices across the globe to remotely, automatically and securely activate, provision, authenticate and certify ‘things’, over-the-air, and to then ingest data into AWS customers’ clouds. Eseye leverages what is known as a ‘multi-IMSI’ SIM. In effect, it’s the same as having lots of SIMs from different Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) from all over the world, all on the one card and backed up with 24/7/365 specialist IoT support,” says McCabe. “We feel this makes life much easier for IoT customers who need scale quickly to feed business and sometimes life-critical data into their AWS Cloud deployments. Remember, customers will be managing anywhere from ten to ten thousand-plus fixed and moving IoT devices, spanning vast geographical regions and multiple MNO territories and we try to make that simple with a one SIM, one monthly bill solution.” <a href="https://www.eseye.com/case-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eseye works with over 800 customers across the globe</a>, including eWATER (<em><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/ewater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read the recent AWS case study on eWATER featuring Eseye here!</a></em>).</p> 
<p>Eseye began working with AWS in 2016, quickly becoming an Advanced Technology Partner and AWS IoT Competency Partner. The AnyNet Secure connectivity solution fully integrates with the AWS IoT Management Console, with all data securely ingesting into the user’s AWS cloud storage. “We were a trailblazer in IoT and are passionate about the business and societal benefits rapidly scalable, more secure cellular M2M services bring for our customers, and in turn their customers,” explains McCabe. “Amongst the main benefits, therefore, of integrating with AWS are that the right solution gets to a wider marketplace rapidly. The AWS team have also been formidable to work with. There has been a real meeting of minds and ambition throughout this project!”</p>

Enter ThingLogix, an Advanced APN Technology Partner and AWS IoT Competency Partner. ThingLogix is all about helping you accelerate your IoT adoption by helping you rapidly develop IoT solutions and supporting the full-lifecycle operation of these solutions.</p> 
<p>“We&nbsp;help&nbsp;companies&nbsp;understand&nbsp;how&nbsp;IoT technologies&nbsp;can&nbsp;create&nbsp;new&nbsp;sources&nbsp;of&nbsp;growth&nbsp;and&nbsp;profit,&nbsp;and&nbsp;then we transform those technologies and business model concepts into differentiated,&nbsp;value-added&nbsp;IoT&nbsp;solutions,” says Carl Krupitzer, CEO of ThingLogix. Self-proclaimed cloud-first believers, the team at ThingLogix has built Foundry, a 100% cloud-based, full application stack for IoT. Foundry is a proprietary cloud platform, and Foundry Packages are component applications that can help customers across a wide range of industries and use cases create, deploy, manage, and evolve connected solutions. ThingLogix customers include <a href="http://www.thinglogix.com/case-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beacon Technical Systems</a>, Sealed Air, <a href="http://3wuaw41ohoui11a4fd1mpkgq.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sennco-Case-Study-AWS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sennco</a>, and <a href="https://thinglogix.wistia.com/medias/vw71uaiqie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jarden Consumer Solutions</a> (<em><a href="http://www.thinglogix.com/case-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find more case studies here</a></em>).</p> 
<p>Architected using AWS best practices, Foundry and Foundry Packages integrate with a number of widely adopted enterprise solutions, including Salesforce, ServiceMax, and ThingWorx. ThingLogix chose to architect its solutions on AWS because of the enterprise-readiness of AWS infrastructure and services and the market leadership that AWS has demonstrated, both in terms of groundbreaking technology innovation and strong customer adoption. “We believe that companies generate much more value for themselves by focusing on the market-facing aspects of IoT solutions and IoT-enabled business models, rather than on the technical underpinnings of the solution and solution architecture. We saw a unique opportunity on AWS to help customers focus on the business value they can drive with IoT,” says Rob Rastovich, CTO of ThingLogix. ”To be attractive to end customers and sustainable in the market, an IoT solution must be enterprise-grade: high-performance, reliable, scalable, extensible, and secure. AWS offers all of these attributes, making it easier for our cloud platform to offer these attributes as well,” adds John Mack, CMO of ThingLogix. “Additionally, with AWS having become the industry standard for cloud infrastructure and services, our prospective customers are already using AWS is most cases.” In addition to utilizing core AWS services for IoT (AWS IoT, Greengrass, and the Enterprise IoT Button program), the company uses a number of AWS products to deliver functionality for market-facing IoT solutions, including AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Kinesis (Analytics, Firehose, and Streams), Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Machine Learning, and Amazon Quicksight.</p>
