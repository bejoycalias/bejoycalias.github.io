<p>To gain the insights needed to fuel business growth, organizations need to collect more data and do more with it. That’s where a data lake can help—it’s a repository that holds a large amount of raw data in its native (structured or unstructured) format until that data is needed, enabling you to accommodate virtually any use case.</p> 
<p><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/data-lake-foundation-with-zeppelin-and-rds/">Check out&nbsp;Cloudwick’s Data Lake Foundation on AWS Quick Start &gt;&gt;</a></strong></p> 
<p>Data lakes can be applied to any industry vertical&nbsp;and&nbsp;usually employ an ELT (extract, load, and transform if necessary) strategy, as compared to the more common ETL (extract, transform, and load) strategy employed in a traditional data warehouse, where the structure must be defined before data is loaded. With a data lake, you don’t need to think through every possible use case ahead of time. You should include a data catalog, though, which I will get into a bit later.</p> 
<p>So how can you build your own data lake and put it to use? A while back,&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=CLOUDWICK%20TECHNOLOGIES&amp;id=001E000000UfaSDIAZ">Cloudwick</a>—an AWS Advanced Consulting Partner that holds the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/big-data/partner-solutions/">AWS Big Data Competency</a>—began offering a&nbsp;<a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/rs/112-TZM-766/images/AWS_SolutionLaunchpad_DataLake_Cloudwick_08032017.pdf">Data Lake Jumpstart</a>&nbsp;to help customers deploy, pilot, and migrate into production a fully-functional data lake running on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This four-week engagement is a heavily-discounted program from both AWS and Cloudwick, with a typical cost of less than $20,000.</p> 
<p>If you’d like to experiment with a data lake but aren’t ready for that kind of investment, check out our&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/data-lake-foundation-with-zeppelin-and-rds/">Data Lake Foundation on AWS Quick Start</a>&nbsp;that we co-authored along with AWS Solutions Architects.&nbsp;You can use this Quick Start to get your own data lake up and running in about 20 minutes. There are no consulting fees, and you won’t pay anything beyond the costs to run it on AWS.</p> 
<p>In this blog post, I will provide a high-level overview of our Quick Start—and then drill down a bit deeper into the workings and value of the data catalog, which we implemented using Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES).</p> 
<b>Architecture for the Data Lake Foundation on AWS Quick Start</b> 
<p>At a high level, our Quick Start provides a data lake foundation that integrates various&nbsp;AWS services to help you migrate both structured and unstructured data from your on-premises environment to the AWS Cloud—and then store, monitor, and analyze the data. <em>Figure 1</em> provides a top-down architectural view, and a full description—including solution architecture, deployment options, and detailed deployment steps—can be found in the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-reference/datalake/cloudwick/latest/doc/data-lake-foundation-wth-zeppelin-and-amazon-rds-on-the-aws-cloud.pdf">deployment guide</a>.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/06/Cloudwick-Data-Lake-Architecture-1024x587.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 1 – This Quick Start provides a data lake foundation that integrates various AWS services to help you migrate both structured and unstructured data from your on-premises environment to the AWS Cloud.</em></p> 
<p>After you deploy the data lake, you can use it to collect and combine multiple data sources and data types in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> (Amazon S3) with a unified view across all the data. This enables a path to ground truth—that is, information provided by direct observation and empirical evidence vs. information provided by inference—and provides a common repository for that information to be shared.</p> 
<h3>Here’s How it All Comes Together:</h3> 
<li>When you launch the Quick Start, it sets up a virtual private cloud (VPC) that spans two Availability Zones and includes two public and private subnets, along with an internet gateway. You can chose to create a new VPC or deploy into your existing VPC on AWS. If you choose the latter, the AWS CloudFormation template that deploys the Quick Start skips creating the VPC and internet gateway.</li> 
<li>In the public subnets, managed NAT gateways allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets, and optional Linux bastion hosts in an Auto Scaling group allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in the public and private subnets. This allows secure access to all the data lake components. Such a setup not only prevents unauthorized access to the data lake but enables integration with other components through NAT gateway.</li> 
<li>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), which is also deployed in the private subnets, enables data migration from a relational database to Amazon Redshift using AWS Data Pipeline. For ETL, we can also leverage AWS Glue.</li> 
<li>In the private subnets, a web server instance (Amazon Machine Image, or AMI) in an Auto Scaling group hosts the data lake portal. This web server also installs Zeppelin to run analytics on the data loaded into Amazon S3.</li> 
<li>AWS Lambda&nbsp;is used to index the metadata from different data sources into Amazon ES. This enables indexing the data flowing into the data lake at scale, without human intervention, and provides visibility into the data. We also use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-zeppelin.html">Zeppelin for ad hoc and exploratory data analysis</a>.</li> 
<li>IAM roles are used to manage permissions to access AWS resources—such as accessing the data in Amazon S3, enabling Amazon Redshift to copy data from Amazon S3 into its tables, and associating the generated IAM role with the Amazon Redshift cluster.</li> 
<li>The other key services being used are Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing (ELB). Both&nbsp;of these services are important pillars of a well-architected application in cloud. Auto Scaling, for example, allows&nbsp;Amazon EC2 capacity to scale out or scale in as per demand, while ELB allows the traffic to be spread across the Amazon EC2 fleet. ELBs support multiple types—Application, Network and Classic Load Balancing—and depending on the application use case, customers can pick up the Load Balancers.</li> 
<b>The Value of a Data Catalog and Why We Used Amazon ES</b> 
<p>Let’s talk about the data catalog, which is supported through our use of Amazon ES. The variety, velocity, and veracity of data that flows into your data lake can be vast, which is why a strong data management layer is required. The data catalog is at the core of this layer and, as such, is the number one component to consider when architecting a data lake.</p> 
<p>But why is the data catalog so important? Remember, the beauty of a data lake is that you don’t need to think through every possible use case up front. To use the data you collect effectively, however, you’ll need to capture metadata to identify which data streams are coming into your data lake, where they come from, their format, and other aspects. Amazon ES does just that, automatically indexing the data that flows into your data lake and making it available via a simple search.</p> 
<p>The diagram in <em>Figure 2</em> shows how this indexing is performed:</p> 
<li>Files can flow into Amazon S3 through any channel.</li> 
<li>File creation in Amazon S3 produces an event you can catch with a Lambda function.</li> 
<li>The Lambda function retrieves data and metadata from Amazon S3, and pushes it into Amazon ES.</li> 
<li>Using Direct&nbsp;Amazon ES&nbsp;API calls or, at a larger scale, Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose can be used to populate Amazon ES. You can also use Logstash, which is a data-collection and log-parsing engine.</li> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/05/Indexing-a-Data-Catalog.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 2 – Having access to so many options for populating the data catalog and indexing the data makes this Quick Start architecture a versatile means of collecting different types of information.</em></p> 
<p>Because the data catalog is indexed, searches are very fast.&nbsp;More importantly, the data catalog makes information in the data lake&nbsp;easy to discover and is accessible by many users, not just the people who built it. The data catalog also gives your data scientists, business analysts, and other users unencumbered, self-service access to the information without the need for highly specialized technical assistance. And because Amazon ES includes Kibana, those users can visualize the content that’s indexed on an&nbsp;Elasticsearch cluster in powerful ways. In addition, Amazon ES captures and indexes all API calls to the data lake, giving you a full audit record of who accessed what.</p> 
<p>At this point, you may be asking, “I get the value of Elasticsearch, but what’s the difference between Elasticsearch—an open source offering—and Amazon ES?” Put simply, Amazon ES makes it easy to deploy, secure, operate, and scale Elasticsearch for log analytics, full text search, application monitoring, and more. As a fully managed service, Amazon ES provides all the capabilities of Elasticsearch alongside the availability, scalability, and security that production workloads require. It even includes built-in integrations with Kibana, Logstash, and AWS services such as Amazon VPC, Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, AWS Lambda, and Amazon CloudWatch—enabling you to go from raw data to actionable insights very quickly.</p> 
<b>Conclusion</b> 
<p>Do you absolutely need a built-in data catalog like the one we implemented using Amazon ES? In my opinion, yes. I often come across companies with data lakes that lack such capabilities, and they suffer from a damaging lack of visibility into data sources, data formats, frequency of data capture, and other aspects of their data. They&nbsp;often have this information somewhere, but it is stored in a place where it&nbsp;is not&nbsp;useful or accessible. A data catalog based on Amazon ES automatically captures and surfaces what’s in your data lake, making it infinitely more valuable when it comes to why you built it in the first place: to uncover the insights needed to fuel business growth.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/">See all the benefits of being an APN Partner &gt;&gt;</a></p> 
<b>Veeam:&nbsp;Bringing Backup Technology to the AWS Cloud</b> 
<p><em>By Sam Khidhir, Solutions Architect at AWS</em></p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Veeam%20Software&amp;id=001E000000VKFVzIAP"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/22/Veeam-Logo-150x150.jpg" /></a>One of the challenges with migrating to the cloud is finding a backup strategy that works for servers that are not physically present in datacenters. How do you perform full-server backups of virtual instances? How do you do it efficiently, securely, and on a schedule that matches your business requirements?</p> 
<p>Through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Veeam%20Software&amp;id=001E000000VKFVzIAP">Veeam</a>, an&nbsp;AWS Advanced Technology Partner, customers can leverage the Veeam Backup &amp; Replication data protection solution to protect <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) instances regardless of Region or Availability Zone. Customers using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vmware/">VMware Cloud on AWS</a>&nbsp;also have full support (as of version 9.5 Update 3) for migrated VMware instances, providing a single solution to protect both virtual and on-premises workloads running on VMware vSphere.</p> 
<p>Regardless of where data is stored, organizations get direct access to Veeam’s suite of powerful features like file-level recovery, change block tracking, and innovative scheduling options, such as reverse incremental backups where the most recent backup will always be a full backup. In addition, data stored in Veeam supports both deduplication and compression so you can optimize storage cost versus performance. There are no special filesystem or hardware requirements for the storage used.</p> 
<p>To ensure backup activity does not negatively impact network bandwidth,&nbsp;Veeam has the ability to configure network throttling rules to limit transfer rates. For out-of-region backups where bandwidth may be even more limited, Veeam can optimize WAN connections using a special WAN Accelerator service. Regardless of how data is transferred, the security of your data is paramount. All backups are encrypted both at-rest and in-flight. Data transfers are done via TLS with AES-256, and the underlying block storage files are encrypted as soon as they arrive at the backup server, once more using AES-256.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/22/Veeam-System-Recovery.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 1 – When it comes to file or system recovery, Veeam offers a wide range of powerful explorers to visualize your backups so you can easily tell what you are restoring.</em></p> 
<p>For customers looking for high durability and low-cost object storage as an offsite backup of their on-premise storage, Veeam also provides an easy-to-implement interface to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/">Amazon Storage Gateway</a>. This tool enables organizations to eliminate legacy backup solutions like tape, by providing seamless access to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/">Amazon S3 Standard – Infrequent Access</a> (Standard – IA)&nbsp;and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/">Amazon Glacier</a>, making it easy and cost effective to move long term archive into the cloud.</p>

<p><em>By Ian Scofield, Partner Solutions Architect at AWS</em></p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=IOpipe&amp;id=001E000001eO9MLIA0"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/22/IOpipe-Logo-150x150.jpg">serverless applications</a> on top of AWS due to a large number of benefits, ranging from the reduced operational overhead to the ability to scale effortlessly. As with any application, though, it’s important you have monitoring to ensure it is performing as expected.</p> 
<p>Monitoring an application whose compute architecture runs on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> is different than one that is running on an Amazon EC2 instance. Metrics such as function duration and memory usage allow you to “right-size” your functions and establish performance baselines. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">Amazon CloudWatch</a> provides logging and monitoring capabilities for your Lambda functions, but <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=IOpipe&amp;id=001E000001eO9MLIA0">IOpipe</a>, an AWS Advanced Technology Partner with AWS Lambda Service Delivery Designation, provides a solution that extends the functionality provided by CloudWatch by giving you even more visibility into the execution of your Lambda functions.</p> 
<p>Developers&nbsp;can integrate IOpipe into Lambda functions by adding their <a href="https://github.com/iopipe/iopipe">open source module</a>, which currently supports Node.js and Python execution environments. Once added, it sends telemetry and other detailed information back to the IOpipe service, which gives you the ability to monitor the performance of the function in near real-time. It also provides you with common information such as memory consumed, duration, and number of invocations, and reports cold starts which are not currently exposed in CloudWatch.</p> 
<p>In addition to the metrics reported on your functions, IOpipe ingests execution traces, errors, and custom metrics to give you a complete picture of how your application is performing. This information is then aggregated, allowing you to search through millions, even billions, of invocations quickly for things like “Find invocations that have errors in the last 15 minutes,” or “Find invocations that were a cold start,” or “Find invocations for a function that were slower than expected.” You can combine search parameters to answer even more specific situations like “Show me the invocations from user Iceman where the write to DynamoDB is greater than 1000ms.”</p> 
<p>Capturing the metrics concerning your functions is important, but knowing what’s going on inside and how you can further optimize your code is even more important. Due to Lambda’s billing model of 100ms blocks, shaving off time has&nbsp;performance implications and financial ones as well. IOpipe recently <a href="https://read.iopipe.com/using-iopipe-profiling-to-gain-crucial-observability-into-your-aws-lambda-functions-506f5dda6bdf">launched a new feature</a> which allows you to profile your Node.js functions. Profiling allows you to analyze how your code is performing and helps you identify areas that can be optimized by stepping through line by line. As you can see in <em>Figure 2</em>, profiling allows you to analyze how your code is performing and helps you identify areas that can be optimized by stepping through line by line and seeing the impact on the overall function.</p>

<b>Narrative Science: Using&nbsp;Natural Language Generation to Automatically Build&nbsp;Reports from Data</b> 
<p><em>By Pratap Ramamurthy, Partner Solutions Architect at AWS</em></p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Narrative%20Science"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/01/22/Narrative-Science-Logo-150x150.jpg">Narrative Science</a>&nbsp;takes this quite literally.&nbsp;Imagine you have a graph or chart representing a dataset, but its meaning is not obvious at first.</p> 
<p>Narrative Science, which holds the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/partner-solutions/">AWS Machine Learning Competency</a>,&nbsp;provides Natural Language Generation (NLG) software in a platform called <a href="https://narrativescience.com/Platform">Quill</a>,&nbsp;or by integrating narratives to other products or platforms via their Dynamic Narratives offering. Dynamic Narratives can help by adding a narrative, in English,&nbsp;to this chart based on insights automatically derived from the data.</p> 
<p>This, and other use cases like it, is inspiring rapid adoption of NLG. A good example&nbsp;is business intelligence (BI) software, which companies use to derive insights from data by generating charts and graphs. The financial services industry deals with enormous amounts of data&nbsp;that needs to be summarized in reports. Generating these reports can be time consuming but could also be automated using NLG. Moreover, some financial compliance implications can be solved with transparent and consistent reporting that is traceable back to the system of record.</p> 
<p>Another example is credit card customers who want&nbsp;to gain insights on their monthly transactions. It is near impossible&nbsp;for a human to write a personalized report for each and every customer. Instead, this can be automated using NLG to save both time and money while also creating value for the end-customer.</p> 
<p>Not all NLG technologies are the same, however. NLGs can be broadly classified into three categories:</p> 
<li><strong>Basic NLG:</strong> This technology converts numbers into text or takes names from a database and inserts them into an email body.</li> 
<li><strong>Templatized NLG:</strong> Here, the user is responsible for writing templates, determining how to join ideas and interpreting the output.</li> 
<li><strong>Advanced NLG:</strong> Advanced NLG communicates the way humans do—assessing the data to identify what is important and interesting to a specific audience, then automatically transforming those insights into intelligent narratives. The result is insightful communications packed with audience-relevant information, written in conversational language.</li> 
<p>Narrative Science’s Quill is an advanced NLG technology that provides realistic, relevant, and accurate narratives. Quill is flexible in ways that allows you fit narratives to your needs. For example, you can choose either a paragraph narrative or bulleted list, short, or verbose narrative. <em>Figure 3</em> shows sample data for a narrative generated for a bar chart in Tableau.</p> 
<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2018/02/07/Narratives-for-Tableau-Screenshot-1024x536.jpg" /> 
<p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Figure 3 – Narrative Science’s Quill is an advanced NLG technology that provides realistic, relevant, and accurate narratives. This is sample data for a narrative generated for a bar chart in Tableau.</em></p> 
<p>Quill is a SaaS platform that runs on AWS, and Dynamic Narratives can be accessed through the <a href="https://narrativescience.com/narratives-for-bi-api-trial">Narrative Science API</a>. You can send data in JSON, XML, or CSV, and the response will contain the narrative text. The time taken depends on the amount of text sent, but it is usually near-instant.</p> 
<p>Narrative Science can also integrate with third-party software and applications via their Dynamic Narratives offering. Dynamic Narratives leverages the core authoring engine of Quill to integrate with data and analytics platforms such as Tableau, Microstrategy, and Qlik. Going beyond partnering with visualization tools, Narrative Science has partnered with <a href="https://www.sisense.com/">Sisense Everywhere</a>, a BI tool, to create a conversational chat bot that can be accessed using an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-70vk93bGU">Amazon Echo</a> device. With this feature, you can ask questions about a dataset that is received by Sisense and uses Narrative Science to generate an answer. <a href="https://narrativescience.com/Resources/Resource-Library/Article-Detail-Page/sisense-narrative-science-collaborate-on-sisense-everywhere">See a&nbsp;demo</a> of how Dynamic Narratives can be embedded into other data and analytics platforms via API.</p> 
<p>You can <a href="https://narrativescience.com/narratives-for-bi-api-trial">access a trial</a> of the Dynamic Narratives API,&nbsp;or use it through your favorite BI tool&nbsp;that is&nbsp;<a href="https://narrativescience.com/Partners/Partner-Network/Narratives-for-BI">already integrated</a>.</p>

<p>This version reflects our most recent program criteria, with improvements focused on raising the bar for both our MSP Partner and Amazon Web Services (AWS) customer experiences. It also reflects feedback from the MSP Partner community and our audit team.</p> 
<p><a href="http://partnercentral.awspartner.com/sfc/#version?selectedDocumentId=0690L000003ivJ9"><strong>Download the AWS MSP Partner Program Validation Checklist v3.2 &gt;&gt;</strong></a></p> 
<b>What is the AWS MSP Partner Program?</b> 
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/managed-service/">AWS MSP Partner Program</a> was developed out of AWS customers’ requests to help them identify APN Partners who could help them migrate, run, and optimize their AWS workloads. The program was thus created to align customers with a set of validated next-generation APN Partners who could deliver this full experience: plan/design &gt;&gt; build/migrate &gt;&gt; run &gt;&gt; optimize.</p> 
<p>In addition to a robust set of requirements, the MSP Partner Program also incorporates the use of a third-party validation audit that brings value to both the participating APN Partners&nbsp;and to AWS customers who can confidently identify qualified MSP Partners.</p> 
<b>What’s New or Different in Version 3.2?</b> 
<p>The focus of the changes from v3.1 to v3.2 has been clarifying, simplifying, and improving the MSP Partner experience. A streamlined Renewal Audit process was introduced in v3.1, and v3.2 further incorporates a Renewal Audit Waiver option for eligible MSP Partners.</p> 
<h3>The full list of changes are:</h3> 
<li>Updated Annual Renewal Audit process and details (see Audit Process &amp; Timing)</li> 
<li>Added Renewal Audit Waiver Option (see Audit Process &amp; Timing)</li> 
<li>Added Impact of Merger, Acquisition &amp; Divestiture Activity (see Audit Process &amp; Timing)</li> 
<li>Added definitions for Reference and Case Study (see Definitions)</li> 
<li>Updated and clarified acceptable evidence for 1.6, 2.2, 4.5, 7.x, 8.1.10, 8.1.11, and 10.x</li> 
<li>Added AWS Services to 3.1—Amazon Aurora, AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS), Amazon GuardDuty, AWS CloudHSM, AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), and AWS Systems Manager</li> 
<li>Updated references to Detailed Billing Report to now reflect Cost &amp; Usage Report</li> 
<li>Updated references and link to APN Portal that now points to APN Partner Central</li> 
<li>Updated evidence requirements for 9.6.1, 9.6.2, and 9.6.3 to specify case studies, in place of use cases (see Definitions)</li> 
<li>Removed section 12.0 Service Reporting and consolidated these items into a single requirement—9.14 Customer Reports</li> 
<li>Removed DevOps requirements from section 9 and moved to section 10.0 DevOps</li> 
<li>Moved section 14.0 SLA Optimization to 11.3</li> 
<li>Provided automatic credit for sections 7.0 Infrastructure&nbsp;&amp; Application Migration Capabilities and 10.0 DevOps for Partners who hold the relevant AWS Competencies (see sections 7.0 and 10.0 for details)</li> 
<p>APN Partners entering the program, or MSP Partners renewing their program status, will be required to use Version 3.2 of the Validation Checklist for all audits as of April 1, 2018.</p>

Cadence produces software, hardware, and silicon structures that are used to design integrated circuits, systems on chips (SoCs), and printed circuit boards.</p> 
<p>Cadence originally ran their own datacenters, but as the enterprise expanded&nbsp;they began to outgrow the computing capacity of the on-premises system. Their team understood prior to moving to the cloud the implications of securing a cloud environment as it scales. They sought to automate as many security tasks as possible while still proving to customers that their environment met high compliance industry standards, and that the security policies they created would be enforced.</p> 
<p>Cadence looked to Amazon Web Services (AWS) Advanced Technology Partner <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Dome9%20Security&amp;id=001E000000Rp584IAB">Dome9 Security</a>&nbsp;to build a system that would enable the company to scale up quickly, efficiently, and flexibly in response to large customer orders.&nbsp;Dome9 is one of the fastest growing born-in-the-cloud security startups fully hosted on AWS, and their Dome9 Arc platform delivers agentless software-as-a-service (SaaS) cloud security and compliance automation, advanced identity and access management (IAM) protection, and active protection for enterprises as they scale their AWS footprint.</p> 
<p><strong><a href="https://dome9.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Dome9-Cadence-Case-Study.pdf">Read the full Cadence-Dome9 case study &gt;&gt;</a></strong></p> 
<b>The Solution</b> 
<p>Cadence selected Dome9,&nbsp;which holds <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/" target="null">AWS Competencies</a> in <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/partner-solutions/" target="null">Security</a> and <a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/networking/partner-solutions/" target="null">Networking</a>, to provide network security management and automated compliance. The Dome9 Arc platform has a&nbsp;deep visualization tool, Dome9 Clarity, which provides a granular view of customers’ AWS Cloud assets–Cadence has 770 security groups, 1,000 <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) instances, and 115 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a>&nbsp;(Amazon VPC) environments with real-time alerts in cases of misconfigurations.</p> 
<b>The Results</b> 
<p>With consolidated control over 50 AWS accounts in 3 AWS regions created by Dome9, Cadence can easily set up access for production teams, training sessions, and customers’ DevOps teams to specific subnets using Dome9 Dynamic Access Leases. These leases provide time-limited access to ports and services and immediately revert a port to closed once the lease has expired. Additionally, Cadence uses Dome9 active protection to enforce established security policies and keep regional data from being accessed by anyone outside of the defined region.</p> 
<p>Dome9’s network security management and automated compliance provides Cadence with many benefits:</p> 
<li><strong>Lower costs and accelerated time-to-market for products</strong>. Without Dome9, Cadence would have to spend an estimated $450,000 more annually on personnel and training.</li> 
<li><strong>Increased efficiency and agility</strong> allows their team to focus on higher level tasks.</li> 
<li><strong>Dome9’s robust platform is certified for ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type 2 compliance</strong>, in addition to providing continuous end-to-end compliance testing and reporting against industry standards and over 500 best practices. This allows Cadence to reassure customers that they are doing everything possible to keep their applications and data safe.</li>

<p>Analysts at C4ADS monitor worldwide events for patterns that warrant a&nbsp;deeper investigation, and their challenge was compounded by having to&nbsp;comb through a growing dataset that included data from different formats and sources.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=ClearScale&amp;id=001E000000Rl0wKIAR">ClearScale</a>, an AWS Premier Consulting Partner, reviewed various designs and approaches it could develop and implement on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to make the data more user-friendly for C4ADS analysts. The solution had to be implemented quickly, scale as needed, and be extremely secure given the nature of the information.</p> 
<p>To meet these requirements, ClearScale—which holds <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/">AWS Competencies</a> in Big Data, DevOps, Marketing &amp; Commerce, Mobile, Migration, and Internet of Things (IoT)—implemented a data lake approach within an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a> (Amazon VPC). The biggest challenge was aggregating multiple file formats (PDFs, emails, Microsoft Word and Excel files, logs, XML and JSON files) while still allowing C4ADS to perform easy searches within a large data repository. Unlike traditional data warehouse methodologies, a data lake allows for any number of data types to be stored and referenced as long as those types have a consistent approach to querying and retrieving data.</p> 
<p>Launched in October 2017, ClearScale’s solution has already optimized the analysts’ jobs by allowing them to do wide-ranging searches and aggregate disparate data types. Later releases will introduce more robust security measures, multi-lingual support, and optical character recognition (OCR) technology to aid in identification of important data markers.</p>
