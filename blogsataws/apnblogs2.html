<h3>Showcasing Innovative Solutions Focusing on Governance, Risk &amp; Compliance (GRC)</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Financial Services industry is highly regulated, with an increasing need to break the trade-off between compliance and innovation. With the surge in data and new business models, managing security, risk, and compliance have become increasingly complex, driving requirements for enhanced security mechanisms, complex financial calculations, and advanced analytics to simulate evolving market conditions. Faced with the limitations of their on-premises agility, storage, and computing capabilities, financial institutions of all sizes—FinTech startups, hedge funds and asset managers, insurers, commercial banks, and global investment banks, among others—are working with AWS and its AWS Partner Network (APN) Partners to become more agile, cost-effective, and customer-centric.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/aws-cloud-solution-ecosystem-transforming-financial-services-tickets-37949244211" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="size-full wp-image-5100 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/10/10/PopupLoft.png" alt="" width="975" height="489" /></a></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As AWS is continuing to enable scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solutions for banking, payments, capital markets, and insurance organizations of all sizes, it has also become evident that our highly specialized APN Partners need to organize by industry and develop solutions to better serve our customer needs in this industry. There’s a clear opportunity to help AWS customers within Financial Services to succeed in moving to AWS Cloud, and for the APN Partners to support the seamless integration and deployment of these solutions. As the financial services industry slowly but surely moves to the cloud, AWS has established the&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/financial-services/partner-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Services APN Partner Competency Program</a>&nbsp;to identify AWS Partner Network (APN) Consulting and Technology Partners with deep industry experience to assist our customers in this industry. These APN Partners have demonstrated industry expertise, readily implemented solutions that solve specific business problems, align with AWS architectural best practices, and have AWS-certified staff. They have gone through a rigorous business and technical validation by AWS teams and are closely engaged and aligned with AWS global financial services team.</p> 
<p>There is a great opportunity to join this upcoming solutions showcase event in New York, led by our AWS Financial Services Competency Partners, to learn how their solutions are helping customers succeed and to join in on the conversations following the sessions. Not only will you hear from our top APN Partners in the industry, you will get an insight on trends in cloud transformation as the financial services industry intensifies its focus on innovation. Learn more from Brad Bailey, Research Director in Capital Markets at&nbsp;Celent, about trends in the financial service’s cloud transformation focusing&nbsp;on governance, risk, and compliance (GRC). Celent helps firms in the financial services industry make better decisions about technology through research and advisory. You will also have an opportunity to hear from Phil Moyers, AWS Director, Global Financial Services, about industry innovation at AWS.</p>

<h3>Solutions Showcase by AWS Financial Services Partners:</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>CTP (Cloud Technology Partners):</strong> CTP’s Continuous Compliance solution provides a single source of truth across Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) enabling real-time monitoring and remediation recommendations on AWS Cloud.</p> 
<p><strong>Domino Data:</strong> A single system for all your models -Documentation, code, and model inventories inevitably get out of sync when spread across systems. Domino solution tracks the provenance of a model from idea to impact, showing who worked on it, what they did, how they deployed it, and how it is used in production.</p> 
<p><strong>Nice Actimize:</strong> Nice Actimize ABC solution analyzes transactions and behavior across the organization and the supply chain, for a real-time, up to date view of their bribery and corruption risk across business, geographic, vendor and customer lines. External risks integrated AML lifecycle management that delivers insight across the breadth of customer activities, ensuring smart and cost-effective AML operations as well as a positive, holistic customer experience.</p> 
<p><strong>Accenture:</strong> This solution will focus on risk management using high power computer (HPC) of AWS. No longer do companies have to procure hardware in anticipation of high-compute workloads, and then let it sit idle when not used. Instead, operational tasks of running compute on AWS are simplified because you can fully automate provisioning and scaling by treating the infrastructure as part of your code base.</p> 
<p><strong>FICO:</strong> FICO Xpress Optimization, as part of the FICO Decision Management Suite, helps financial services organizations identify and fine-tune policies and processes across the customer lifecycle to improve Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) subject to business, operational and legal constraints.

<p><em>Post by Sabari Radhkrishnan, a SAP Partner Solutions Architect at AWS</em></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) and SUSE have been working together for years to bring SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) to our joint SAP customers. Since 2012, when <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/sap-start-the-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS first certified its platform</a> for SAP workloads, including SAP HANA One, customers have been using the SLES operating system to run their SAP applications on AWS. When AWS certified its instances for SAP HANA in 2014, customers started using SLES for their SAP HANA deployments on AWS as well. In 2015, SLES for SAP was made <a href="https://www.suse.com/newsroom/post/2015/suse-linux-enterprise-server-for-sap-applications-now-available-on-amazon-web-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available in AWS</a> through SUSE’s bring-your-own-subscription program; and in 2016, SLES for SAP became <a href="https://www.suse.com/newsroom/post/2016/suse-boosts-business-flexibility-by-expanding-availability-of-suse-linux-enterprise-server-for-sap-applications-in-aws-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available in AWS Marketplace</a> as an on-demand image, so our existing and new customers could easily get started with their mission-critical SAP workloads.</p> 
<p>As part of our continuing efforts to provide our joint SAP customers with the best experience, we are pleased to announce today that SLES for SAP will become available in AWS Marketplace as an AWS offering in Q4 2017. This will be the second joint listing from AWS and SUSE after SLES, which was launched almost seven years ago. With the release of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/x1-instances-for-ec2-ready-for-your-memory-intensive-workloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X1</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-ec2-instances-with-4-tb-of-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X1e</a> instances, which are purpose-built for in-memory workloads such as SAP HANA, we are seeing that more customers are choosing to run SAP workloads in development, test, and production on AWS.</p> 
<p>The new SLES for SAP listing will make it easier for customers to run SAP workloads on AWS, because they will receive joint support from AWS and SUSE, and the new offering will be priced competitively. SUSE and AWS will continue to work together to enhance and optimize the OS for SAP workloads on AWS.</p> 
<p>SLES for SAP includes the High Availability Extension (HAE), which allows SAP HANA instances to seamlessly fail over between Availability Zones. The software also includes other enhancements such as page cache management and kernel settings that are optimized for SAP workloads. In addition, SLES for SAP images carry extended service pack support so customers can run the next-to-last service pack for up to 18 months. You can find more details about the benefits of using SLES for SAP on the <a href="https://www.suse.com/products/sles-for-sap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SUSE website</a>.</p> 
<p>Customers can easily get started with SLES for SAP for their SAP HANA workloads by using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/sap-hana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Quick Start for SAP HANA</a>. This Quick Start helps provision and configure the infrastructure required to deploy SAP HANA in less than an hour, following best practices from AWS, SAP, and SUSE.</p> 
<p>Customers can continue to leverage SUSE’s <a href="https://www.suse.com/solutions/public-cloud/#bring-your-own" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bring-your-own-subscription program</a> to use their existing subscriptions to run their SAP workloads on AWS; see&nbsp;<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/suse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aws.amazon.com/suse</a> for details.

<p>Diagnosing the medical mysteries behind acutely ill babies can be a race against time, filled with a barrage of tests and misdiagnoses. During the first few days of life, a few hours can save or seal the fate of patients admitted to the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Accelerating the analysis of the medical assays conducted in these hospitals can improve patient outcomes, and, in some cases, save lives.</p> 
<p>Precision medicine relies on the aggregate of these types of tests (and others) to advance healthcare. Due to decreasing costs and faster turnaround times, genome sequencing is one such test that is gaining adoption throughout healthcare. Understanding a patient’s genetic predisposition to different diseases is fundamental to establishing a medical risk baseline. In certain cases, such as in NICUs, a patient’s genetic profile can unlock the specific cause of a disease and inform the subsequent medical interventions that might work.</p> 
<p>Today, we’d like to tell you about two of our AWS Partner Network (APN) Partners, DNAnexus and Edico Genome, who are working together to advance the principles of precision medicine, and are already changing lives through genomics.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Introducing DNAnexus</h3> 
<p><a href="https://www.dnanexus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNAnexus</a>, an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/health/life-sciences-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Life Sciences Competency Partner</a>, offers data management, next-generation sequencing data analysis, and secure collaboration for large-scale life sciences enterprises. The DNAnexus platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solution provides a secure and unified system that scales to meet its clients’ unique needs, such as merging de-identified clinical data with genetic data. The API-based DNAnexus platform enables customers (e.g., pharma, researchers, hospitals) to create custom workflows to analyze genomics data as they see fit, such as to develop new drugs or diagnose rare diseases.</p> 
<p>Naturally, the data generated by these processes is sensitive and its protection is paramount. DNAnexus has architected their platform to align with <a href="https://www.dnanexus.com/product-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">key security and compliance frameworks</a>, such as HIPAA, 21 CFR Part 11, CLIA, and FedRAMP.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Introducing Edico Genome</h3> 
<p><a href="http://www.edicogenome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edico Genome</a>, an APN Standard Tier Partner and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/f1/partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EC2 F1 Instance Partner</a>, is focused on facilitating the growth of precision medicine. By accelerating one of precision medicine’s central components, genome sequencing analysis, without sacrificing accuracy, Edico Genome enables researchers and clinicians to understand the relationships between genetic variation and disease.</p> 
<p>Edico Genome accelerates sequencing analysis by using field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, in its Dynamic Read Analysis for GENomics (<a href="http://www.edicogenome.com/dragen-bioit-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DRAGEN</a>) solution. In contrast to conventional CPU-based systems, which must execute lines of software code to perform an algorithmic function, FPGAs use logic circuits to accelerate algorithms and provide outputs almost instantaneously. By replicating these logic circuits thousands of times over, DRAGEN is able to achieve industry-leading speeds by allowing for massive parallelism—unlike CPUs, which are limited to running only one task per core. FPGAs are also fully reconfigurable, allowing users to quickly switch between different functions and pipelines</p> 
<p>Today, Edico Genome is deployed on our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/f1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FPGA-based Amazon EC2 F1 instances</a> and can process a whole genome sequence in about 70 minutes on an f1.2xlarge instance type and about 30 minutes on an f1.16xlarge instance type. These speeds can be over 10 times faster than current state-of-the-art algorithms.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>How they’re working together</h3> 
<p>Recently, DNAnexus and Edico Genome <a href="http://www.edicogenome.com/edico-genome-launches-dragen-dnanexus-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced a joint partnership</a> to integrate Edico Genome’s DRAGEN solution, deployed on Amazon EC2 F1 instance family, into the DNAnexus platform. This integration gives customers the ability to leverage the speed of DRAGEN to analyze genomes coming from high-throughput sequencers, while also inheriting the security and compliance controls that DNAnexus has implemented. At a high level, here’s what this collaboration looks like:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5075 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/26/DNAnxusEdico1.png" alt="" width="975" height="471" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>DNAnexus ingests raw data (called base calls or reads) from genome sequencers such as Illumina’s NovaSeq. These reads are fed into DRAGEN, which is running on an EC2 F1 instance, to speed up the identification of genome variations that can influence disease progression. Results are stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon S3</a>) using industry-standard compression algorithms. Depending on the use case, customers can then collaborate across research sites while adhering to the regulatory requirements around sensitive data by using the capabilities built into the DNAnexus platform.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Collaborating to improve clinical care</h3> 
<p><a href="https://www.rchsd.org/programs-services/rady-childrens-institute-for-genomic-medicine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rady Children’s Institute for Genomic Medicine</a> is one of the global leaders in advancing precision medicine. To date, the institute has sequenced the genomes of more than 3,000 children and their family members to diagnose genetic diseases. 40% of these patients are diagnosed with a genetic disease, and 80% of these receive a change in medical management. This is a remarkable rate of change in care, considering that these are rare diseases and often involve genomic variants that have not been previously observed in other individuals.</p> 
<p>The institute <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170503005939/en/DNAnexus-Powers-Genome-Analysis-Network-Rady-Children%E2%80%99s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adopted the DNAnexus platform</a> to gain a secure, flexible, and scalable environment for local and distributed sequencing and analysis. Using DNAnexus with DRAGEN provides Rady with a highly optimized, end-to-end, whole genome sequencing analysis solution. Edico Genome’s DRAGEN data analysis pipeline is central to Rady’s ultra-rapid genomic data analysis, because it significantly reduces costs and turnaround time while maintaining accuracy. (Edico and Rady also previously worked together to set a <a href="http://www.edicogenome.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Edico-Genome-Rady-Childrens-White-Paper-March-2017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guinness World Record for fastest genetic diagnosis</a>.)</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>“Our goal is to ensure that genome-powered precision medicine is available to every child who needs it. To do this, we needed a rapid research-to-bedside pipeline and be able to scale it and make it accessible to hospitals around the world,” said Stephen Kingsmore, M.D., D.Sc., president and chief executive officer at Rady Children’s Institute for Genomic Medicine. “DNAnexus has the technology and expertise to facilitate this ambitious project, Edico Genome’s rapid testing capability allows for rapid diagnosis of critically ill newborns.”</em></p> 
</blockquote> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5076 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/26/DNAnexusEdico2.png" alt="" width="975" height="410" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Based on the success of this partnership, Rady Children’s Institute is expanding this integrated solution to their partners nationally, fostering a growing genomic database that healthcare providers can access to quickly diagnose rare diseases in children.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Collaborating to advance precision medicine</h3> 
<p>One of the most rewarding things about working in Healthcare and Life Sciences at AWS is seeing how our APN Partners can work together to change the lives of people. The DNAnexus and Edico Genome partnership is one such example that is making a lasting impact on the healthcare industry. We look forward to seeing the results of this partnership advance precision medicine, and deliver results like the ones experienced at Rady Children’s Institute across the clinical landscape.</p>

<h3>Explore the AWS Competency Program: Helping Customers Identify Top AWS Partner Network (APN) Partners on AWS across Industries, Verticals, and Solutions</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h5></h5> 
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-4581 size-medium" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/06/13/competency_small-color-300x54.png" alt="" width="300" height="54" />Customers use AWS to meet a wide variety of their IT needs, and many customers leverage the AWS Partner Network (APN) to provide additional value. Are you looking to engage with an AWS Consulting Partner who can help you effectively migrate your applications to AWS? Are you a media firm hoping to identify an AWS Technology Partner solution that can help you render video footage in the cloud? Chances are, whatever you’re looking to do on AWS, there’s an APN Partner whose services or solutions can help you leverage all of the benefits that the AWS Cloud provides.</p> 
<p>But how do you identify the right APN Partner with whom to engage? And what does it mean to identify the right APN Partner?</p> 
<p>Here’s where the AWS Competency Program comes in.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Competency Program</a> is the global APN Partner program focused on providing our customers and sellers with guidance on the most qualified APN Technology and Consulting Partners who have deep expertise and proven customer success in specific solutions areas, such as Big Data, DevOps, Migration, and IoT; in vertical markets such as Financial Services, Healthcare and Life Sciences, Government, Digital Media; and with enterprise business applications, including Microsoft Workloads and SAP. AWS Competencies help customers find APN Partners who can bring the right expertise for their specific business needs by quickly narrowing the search among the tens of thousands of partners in the APN network.</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>“Our AWS Healthcare Competency partners repeatedly demonstrate expertise in serving the needs of the payer and provider communities to advance human health,” says Dr. Oxana Pickeral, the Global Segment Leader for Healthcare &amp; Life Sciences at AWS. “Healthcare customers routinely leverage their rapid pace of innovation to tackle the entire healthcare spectrum, from security and compliance to population health analytics.”</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>The AWS Competency Program is the vehicle by which the APN Partners with the right solution or industry expertise are identified and validated. This validation, however, does not come easily.</p> 
<p>AWS Competency Partners go through a rigorous technical assessment and verification of their expertise specific to each AWS Competency. AWS solutions architects perform a thorough technical validation that challenges APN Partners to raise the bar on their AWS Competency-specific solutions and the use of AWS best practices for security and architecture in the AWS Cloud. Additionally, AWS Competency Partners’ case studies go through a review by an independent third-party audit firm before they are accepted into the AWS Competency Program.</p> 
<p>Each AWS Competency is different and has a&nbsp;distinct&nbsp;set of requirements that can be easily viewed by AWS Customers. This facilitates transparency and helps customers understand the meticulous process that AWS Competency Partners go through. The requirements are designed to evolve and become more stringent&nbsp;over time as&nbsp;industry verticals and solution areas mature in the AWS Cloud,&nbsp;meeting a core goal of continually&nbsp;raising the bar for AWS Competency achievements. Additionally, AWS&nbsp;Competency Partners are&nbsp;re-evaluated every 12-24 months to ensure the program only validates APN Partners who are truly committed to enhancing and refining their expertise and&nbsp;leadership&nbsp;in their space. The AWS Competency Program’s overarching goal&nbsp;is to give AWS Customers the confidence that they are choosing APN Partners that are&nbsp;highly specialized in a specific AWS solution or industry vertical.</p> 
<h3>Raising the Bar for Customers and APN Partners</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The AWS Competency status is attained by mature APN Partners who work closely with AWS business and technical teams and share a common vision and dedication to delivering top notch customer experience and meaningful success.</p> 
<p>Here’s what some of our AWS Competency Partners are saying about the AWS Competency Program:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Scott Udell, Vice President of IoT Solutions at Cloud Technology Partners (CTP), notes that CTP’s Security, IoT, Migration, DevOps, and Financial Services Competency achievements are a “stamp of approval”. “This is a strong recognition of our work around IoT, and it will help us gain traction in the marketplace.”</li> 
<li>ClearData CEO Darin Brannan says his firm’s AWS Healthcare Competency Partner is “an achievement that affirms our position in healthcare security, compliance, and managed services, while our work on AWS enables healthcare organizations to quickly deploy services and apps in a healthcare-fortified AWS environment.”</li> 
<li>Aaron Klein, Founder and Chief Operating Officer of CloudCheckr, says, “While AWS holds its APN Partners to high standards, AWS also consistently supports and works with those who meet the standards. AWS’ help through the APN and Competency Program has proven invaluable in helping CloudCheckr thrive and grow as a solution and as a company. We would not be where we are today without the benefits of being an APN Partner.”</li> 
<li>“The APN takes its Competency designations seriously. This gives credence to the companies that achieve these Competencies and provides a benchmark that differentiates other APN Partners in this space,” explains Robert Groat, EVP, Technology and Strategy, Smartronix. “We want our government clients to know that we are committed to delivering AWS solutions that meet their unique and demanding requirements. As an AWS Premier Partner in the AWS Government Competency Program we have benefited from being able to deliver highly secure, highly available, fault tolerant and innovative solutions that have transformed the way our government customers deliver services to its constituents.”</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The AWS Competency Program currently has 17 programs under the AWS Competency umbrella, and will continue to expand as solution areas mature in the AWS Cloud. The AWS Competency Program was founded on the philosophy of quality over quantity, which is why each AWS Competency is designed with a high requirements bar.</p> 
<p>Once the APN Partners have achieved an AWS Competency status, they qualify for a number of benefits in the APN Program designed to enable them to accomplish even greater successes. For example, AWS Competency Partners are invited to upcoming product release information sessions, gain access to AWS private betas, they are the first APN Partners to be given an opportunity to host subject-matter webinars, and gain access to AWS roadmap briefings.</p> 
<p>AWS Competency Partners are closely engaged with APN teams and have the opportunity to leverage AWS Competency Partner exclusive events to provide feedback to the APN leadership. AWS Competency Partners receive a special designation in the APN Partner Solutions Finder directory and a listing on the AWS segment or solutions web pages, to mention a few of the program benefits.</p> 
<p>The AWS Competency Program offers an enormous value to AWS Competency Partners who choose to continuously raise the bar together with AWS and share our customer obsession, but for AWS Customers, this value is potentially greater! It gives our customers a high degree of confidence in choosing a company that is aligned with AWS rapid innovation and dedication to deliver the best possible results.</p>

<p>Bridgewater Associates, based in Westport, CT, is a major investment management firm with more than $150 billion in assets that it manages for a global customer base of pension funds, endowments, foundations, central banks, and national governments. It is also an Amazon Web Services (AWS) customer that we’ve worked closely with over the past year and half, developing a partnership that helps Bridgewater leverage the tools—and benefits—of the AWS Cloud.</p> 
<p>Last December, Bridgewater Systems Engineer Joel Thompson approached us with questions around the features and future roadmap of the GetCallerIdentity API call. He also mentioned work that he was doing with APN Technology Partner HashiCorp to solve the challenge of <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HashiCorp Vault</a> authentication in scalable and serverless environments.</p> 
<p>In their own words, here’s how Joel and HashiCorp Product Manager Andy Manoske describe what happened next.</p> 
<h3>Joel Thompson, Bridgewater Systems Engineer</h3> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Our business requires us to be highly focused on security. For that reason, we’ve been big fans of HashiCorp’s Vault since it was first released. However, we faced the challenge of how to securely authenticate to Vault from various AWS services, such as from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in an autoscaling group, code running in AWS Lambda (Lambda), and other environments. We were not alone in this either. Many in the financial services industry have long been asking for a solution to this problem.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>One of my coworkers proposed a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues/948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solution</a>&nbsp;that, to work properly, required AWS to add a new API method – the WhoAmI method that is a feature we requested from our AWS Enterprise Support team. Last year, AWS added what was needed — <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetCallerIdentity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sts:GetCallerIdentity</a>. So, collaborating with the Vault engineering team and consulting with AWS support, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS authentication backend</a>&nbsp;in Vault was born, making it easier for AWS customers to secure their cloud-native applications.</p> 
</blockquote> 
<h3>Andy Manoske, HashiCorp Product Manager</h3> 
<blockquote> 
<p>HashiCorp&nbsp;has created six open-source projects to enable organizations to provision, secure, connect, and run any infrastructure for any application. This is particularly important for organizations that are migrating their workloads to cloud services such as AWS. HashiCorp Vault is one of those projects, providing a focus on securing any infrastructure for any application. Vault provides secrets management, encryption as a service, and a way to enforce privilege and access management.</p> 
<p>Vault is an open-source project, with a growing community of contributors, users, and HashiCorp employees collaborating on the features that go into Vault. One example of this was a major enhancement in Vault 0.7.1 to the AWS-Amazon EC2 authentication backend. The enhancement now makes it easy for many different AWS resource types to securely authenticate with Vault.&nbsp; Given the broadened scope of what this backend can now do it has been &nbsp;renamed to the AWS authentication backend. &nbsp;This backend solved a series of challenges we were seeing within the open-source community and our customer base around securely enabling access to secrets from an AWS-based infrastructure. AWS resources can then access and use the secrets managed by Vault. This includes resources such as Lambda functions, Amazon EC2 Container Services jobs, Amazon EC2 instances, or any other client with access to AWS Identity and Access Management credentials can use those credentials to securely authenticate to Vault to retrieve their secrets.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The AWS authentication backend is an enhancement that was contributed and collaborated on by Joel Thompson at Bridgewater. Through Bridgewater’s use of Vault, Joel recognized a more specific enhancement to the authentication backend and then worked with the HashiCorp Vault engineers to make it a reality.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>Through this engagement, which included assistance from AWS Enterprise Support to help them plan and build the solution using best practices and guidance from the AWS Identity service team, Bridgewater and HashiCorp were able to quickly and confidently collaborate on an important Vault feature.</p>

<p>Building on the strategic alliance between Amazon Web Services and Salesforce, we are excited to announce the first release of the <strong>Amazon Connect Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) Adapter for Salesforce</strong>.</p> 
<p>Amazon Connect is designed as a highly scalable, self-service, cloud-based contact center service that makes it easy for any business to deliver better customer service at lower cost. Salesforce Service Cloud empowers agents on the path to customer success with smarter and faster service tools. Now, the Amazon Connect contact center service and Salesforce’s customer relationship management (CRM) work together to provide the essential foundation for your organization’s customer service experience. This helps support integrated customer workflows between interactive voice response (IVR), automatic call distributor (ACD), and CRM – all critical to contact center strategies.</p> 
<p>The Amazon Connect CTI Adapter is the first release of the package that is designed to provide complete cloud-based integration and workflow capabilities between Amazon Connect, Salesforce Service Cloud and Sales Cloud.</p> 
<p>The Amazon Connect CTI Adapter provides a WebRTC browser-based contact control panel (CCP) within the Salesforce Lightning, Console, and Classic CRM experience. This CTI integration gives your agents the ability to leverage both inbound caller ID screen pop-ups and outbound click to call/transfer/conferencing.<br /> <img class="size-full wp-image-5005 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/06/Connect1.png" alt="" width="890" height="468" /></p> 
<h5 style="text-align: center"></h5> 
<h5 style="text-align: center">Agent logging a screen pop call from the Amazon Connect Contact Control Panel (CCP) within the Salesforce Service Cloud Lightning experience</h5> 
<h5></h5> 
<b>Getting Started</b> 
<p>If you have not spun up an Amazon Connect instance, take a look at our <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/gettingstarted.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting Started Guide</a>. The Amazon Connect CTI Adapter integration leverages both the <a href="https://github.com/aws/amazon-connect-streams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Connect Streams API</a> and the <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_cti.meta/api_cti/sforce_api_cti_intro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salesforce Open CTI API</a>. In this blog post, we’re going to focus on setting up the Amazon Connect CTI Adapter for Lightning experience. You can follow the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/salesforce-integration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">setup instructions</a> for enabling the CTI Adapter for the Salesforce Classic and Console experience.</p> 
<h3>Step 1: Install the Amazon Connect CTI Adapter</h3> 
<p>Once you have your Amazon Connect and Salesforce CRM instances running, the first step will be to install the <strong>Amazon Connect CTI Adapter</strong> from the <a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000EJH4yUAH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salesforce AppExchange</a>:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5006 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/06/Connect2.png" alt="" width="975" height="513" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We recommend you initially install the package into your Salesforce sandbox.</p> 
<h3>Step 2: Configure your Salesforce Call Center</h3> 
<p>After the package has been installed, the next step is to set up your Salesforce call center configuration. This configuration is a XML file you import into your call center, which provides all the details required to enable the Amazon Connect CTI Adapter. First, <a href="http://amazonconnect-sfdc-installation.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/resources/24AC4F3F034E447BE9CEAEE5CA37BFC3.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download</a> the call center XML configuration and import it into your Lightning call center configuration:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5007 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/06/Connect3.png" alt="" width="975" height="313" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Edit the call center configuration and verify the following:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5008 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/06/Connect4.png" alt="" width="975" height="677" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ol> 
<li>The suffix for the Amazon Connect CTI Adapter URL is set to Lightning. If you were configuring the Amazon Connect CTI Adapter for Classic or Console, those suffixes would be used instead.</li> 
<li>Salesforce Compatibility Mode is set for Lightning. This would be set to Classic if you were configuring for Classic or Console.</li> 
<li>The Amazon Connect CCP URL is set to your Amazon Connect instance name. (replace YOURINSTANCENAME with your Amazon Connect instance name).</li> 
<li>If you are using this in another country (i.e. Great Britain), set the appropriate two digit ISO country code.</li> 
<li>Provide access to users (i.e. admins, supervisors, agents) who will be using the CCP.</li> 
</ol> 
<h3>Step 3: Whitelist Your Salesforce’s Visualforce Domain</h3> 
<p>At this point, you have properly configured your Salesforce instance. The next step is to whitelist your Salesforce Visualforce domain within your Amazon Connect’s Application integration. This is required from a security perspective to ensure you are allowing cross-domain access to your Amazon Connect instance. More information about whitelisting can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/aws/amazon-connect-streams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Connect Streams documentation</a>.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5009 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/06/Connect5.png" alt="" width="975" height="278" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you’re unsure of the Salesforce Visualforce domain, or if it is getting blocked by Amazon Connect, you can find it by previewing the URL of the Amazon Connect Visualforce page within your Salesforce instance.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5010 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/06/Connect6.png" alt="" width="975" height="394" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<b>Testing the Amazon Connect CTI Adapter</b> 
<p>Now that you have everything configured, let’s give this a go. Open your Chrome or Firefox browser and login to your Amazon Connect instance (https://YOURINSTANCENAME.awsapps.com/connect/login). Open another tab and log into your Salesforce CRM instance and go to your Sales or Service Console Lightning application.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5011 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/06/Connect7.png" alt="" width="927" height="490" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If you are not seeing the phone icon or an empty pop-up, take a look at our troubleshooting guide in the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/salesforce-integration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">setup instructions</a>. You should notice that all numbers have a phone icon next to them. At this point, you can leverage the click-to-call capability when you press the icon or number.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5012 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/06/Connect8.png" alt="" width="878" height="465" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It will make an outbound call via the Amazon Connect CCP and connect to the customer when they answer the call.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5013 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/06/Connect9.png" alt="" width="945" height="497" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Once you complete the call, the Amazon Connect CCP will go into AfterCallWork status where the agent can perform any follow up activities (e.g. logging a call). After these activities are completed, they can make themselves available to take more calls.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5014 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/06/Connect10.png" alt="" width="909" height="484" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If the agent is in an available state and they receive a call, the inbound call will screen pop the Amazon Connect CCP and any matching records for the caller ID.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5015 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/06/Connect11.png" alt="" width="975" height="518" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can also configure the screen pop behavior in the Softphone layouts under your Salesforce call center configuration.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5016 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/06/Connect12.png" alt="" width="975" height="834" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<b>What’s next</b> 
<p>This is the first release of the Amazon Connect CTI Adapter for Salesforce. More features are coming soon as AWS determines how to best provide more integrated capabilities with Salesforce Service and Sales Cloud. Please try out the Amazon Connect CTI Adapter and open a case with your feedback. We value your input because it will help us define our next set of features.</p>

<p>This month, we have three Partner Solutions Architects who will be highlighting four APN Partners they’ve been working with.&nbsp; We will hear from David Potes, Chris Hein, and Pratap Ramamurthy, who will dive deeper into offerings from JFrog, Linkerd, Solodev, and Sparkpost!</p> 
<h3>JFrog, by David Potes</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p class="alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-5025 alignleft" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/11/SeptRoundup1.png" alt="" width="242" height="212" />&nbsp;A few months ago, I had the opportunity to attend the <a href="https://swampup.jfrog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JFrog Swampup</a> conference in Napa, California. Not only do they have an impressive list of customers, including Amazon, but they also have a few interesting products. The energy and enthusiasm that I felt from the community there really piqued my interest, so I took some time to dive into one of their key offerings. JFrog is all about open source, and the product I’m focusing on today, <a href="https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Welcome+to+Artifactory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JFrog Artifactory</a>, has a free open source version. They also offer enhanced versions with enterprise features and a SaaS-delivered version, for customers that would rather leave operations to someone else.</p> 
<p>As companies of all sizes have embraced open source technology, their development processes have evolved from primarily using proprietary in-house coding to an amalgamation of free open source libraries, commercial libraries, as well as their own code. Just as in modern manufacturing, code is often assembled from components rather than developed from scratch. The benefits of this approach are well-documented, but using open source or commercial libraries introduces a few new challenges, too.</p> 
<p>The biggest challenge is managing complexity. Often companies have a polyglot of languages they support, packages of various types and system artifacts such as Docker and Vagrant images. Each of these can have its own upstream and downstream dependencies, versions, licenses, and traceability data. The aim of a universal package manager, such as JFrog Artifactory, is to standardize the way that organizations manage all package types used in the software development process.</p> 
<p>Just as teams adopted version control systems for source control, many companies are now adopting package management systems for binary artifacts. Below are a few key things to look for as you are evaluating an artifact repository.</p> 
<p><strong>Highly available access to remote artifacts</strong>. A package control system can act as an intermediate cache for remote repositories. This is known as a remote repository, though the parlance is a bit confusing. By acting as a proxy and a caching system, the tool is designed to provide faster access to binaries, as well as limit the blast radius, when an external repository is temporarily unavailable (or even permanently).</p> 
<p><strong>Full integration with your DevOps toolchain</strong>. Just as with source control, an artifact repository is at the center of your toolchain processes, so it’s critical for it to integrate with the tools that you use (or ones that you may use in the future). JFrog has a staggering number of integrations; everything from CI servers like Jenkins and Bamboo, remote repositories like Nuget and Github, to provisioning tools like Chef and Puppet and familiar names like Maven, Gradle, and Ivy.</p> 
<p><strong>Security and Access Control</strong>. Controlling access to entire repositories down to individual artifacts is a key feature, but also look for the ability to integrate existing access controls via LDAP or SAML. JFrog supports this functionality, as well limiting what can be downloaded to the virtual repository via blacklisting/whitelisting.</p> 
<p><strong>License governance</strong>. With a tool like JFrog Artifactory, you can scan the licensing requirements for any packages you download to the repository and provide immediate feedback on the package and its dependencies. This allows you to make sure you’re compliant early on in the development cycle, and prevent unnecessary delays when it’s time to go to production.</p> 
<p>I’ve only scratched the surface on what you can do with JFrog Artifactory, and I plan to revisit this for a deeper dive in the future. In the meantime, if you’d like to give it a try yourself, JFrog offers a free trial for the <a href="https://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/free-trial/#Pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/free-trial/#Cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SaaS</a> versions, or you can just <a href="https://www.jfrog.com/open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grab the open source version</a> and see for yourself.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Linkerd, by Chris Hein</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-5026 size-medium" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/11/SeptRoundup2-300x112.png" alt="" width="300" height="112" />When building a distributed system, you have to deal with the challenges of making reliable/resilient requests from one service to another. While the underlying Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) layer can take care of packet-level reliability, request-level reliability–retries, timeouts, load balancing, circuit breaking, discovery, and so on–is relegated to application code. The advent of containers and automated container orchestration has only amplified these issues by making microservices easier to adopt than ever.</p> 
<p>In the past, large scale companies developed OSS toolchains like <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/smartstack-service-discovery-in-the-cloud-4b8a080de619" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmartStack</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/prana-a-sidecar-for-your-netflix-paas-based-applications-and-services-258a5790a015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prana</a> to offload this logic from the application and into a dedicated network proxy which handles requests going from one service to another. Although these solutions work, they’re tied to specific technology choices such as <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZooKeeper</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/eureka" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eureka</a>.</p> 
<p>Enter <a href="https://linkerd.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linkerd</a> by APN Partner <a href="https://buoyant.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buoyant</a>. Linkerd is an open source,&nbsp;transparent layer 5/7 network proxy that is deployed as a “service mesh” to automatically add reliability and instrumentation to service requests. Linkerd integrates with a wide variety of environments including Consul, Kubernetes, and DC/OS. In Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS), Linkerd only requires you to run a service discovery framework to be effective.</p>

<p>Buoyant has recently been working with various ECS customers to document the best practices from the field. With these best practices, ECS customers can deploy Linkerd as a service mesh using <a href="https://www.consul.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consul</a> by <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hashicorp</a> for service discovery, allowing you to monitor all internal request traffic (including top-line service metrics such as success rates and latency distributions), automatically retry requests when a service fails, or even dynamically route requests. For more information check out their blog post: <a href="https://buoyant.io/2017/08/08/a-service-mesh-for-ecs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Service Mesh for ECS</a></p>

<h3>Solodev Web Experience Platform, by Pratap Ramamurthy</h3>

<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-5028 size-medium" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/11/SeptRoundup4-300x67.png" alt="" width="300" height="67" /></p> 
<p>When <a href="https://www.oneblood.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OneBlood</a>, a non-profit organization that provides blood donation services, experienced a sudden 2700% increase in traffic on their website in one hour, the website did not go down. This is because they run on the <a href="https://www.solodev.com/product/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web Experience Platform</a>, which was created and is managed by <a href="https://www.solodev.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solodev</a>, an APN Advanced Technology Partner.</p> 
<p>The Solodev Web Experience Platform is an advanced Web Content Management System (CMS) that helps customers deploy, host and manage enterprise-level websites as well as integrate their web content. It is architected based on best practices for security, high availability, and scalability as defined by the <a href="https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS_Well-Architected_Framework.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Well-Architected Framework</a>. Solodev uses the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elastic Load Balancing</a> service to distribute traffic to application servers that reside in multiple Availability Zones, to provide high availability. When there are spikes in traffic, Solodev scales horizontally by using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS OpsWorks</a> to provision more instances.</p> 
<p>The platform comes with several features that set it apart from a simple CMS. When you create new web content, A/B testing is arguably the most important tool you can use to find out what is working and what is not, especially before you release changes to production. With the Solodev platform, users can conduct A/B testing using <a href="https://www.solodev.com/blog/digital-marketing/introducing-a-b-testing-with-solodev-experiments.stml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solodev Experiments</a>, rapidly iterate through changes in their web content, and make informed decisions based on experimentation and testing.</p> 
<p>Web content is a key part of an enterprise’s marketing effort. When web content, mobile content, CRM, and other marketing campaigns come together, the user gets a seamless experience. Solodev integrates with popular CRM software like <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salesforce</a> and <a href="https://www.sugarcrm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SugarCRM</a>, so you can import new leads from web forms into your CRM system. When you run an email campaign, having a web content manager that is aware of the campaign helps increase its success by making it seamless for the recipients. With this goal, Solodev has integrated with popular marketing automation tools like <a href="http://www.pardot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pardot</a>, <a href="https://www.marketo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marketo</a>, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/marketingcloud/products/marketing-automation/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eloqua</a> and <a href="https://www.solodev.com/product/api-integration.stml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many more</a>. These features and integration points turn the platform into a truly advanced Web Content Management System.</p> 
<p>About the Solodev solution running on the AWS platform, OneBlood states, “While we were happy to have an uptime of 95% previously, we now see an uptime of 99.97%.” You can <a href="https://www.solodev.com/resources/case-studies/oneblood-website-case-study.stml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read about the OneBlood customer case study</a> and try out the platform, which is available as a SaaS subscription.</p>

<h3>SparkPost, by Pratap Ramamurthy</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-5034 size-medium" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/11/sparkpostlogo-300x78.png" alt="" width="300" height="78" />&nbsp;In my first job, I was tasked to send out a newsletter to around 10,000 recipients. I wrote a quick test program using open source libraries, and successfully tested by sending a few emails. Later, when I started sending all 10,000 emails, everything started to fall apart. In hindsight, I should have used an email delivery service like <a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SparkPost</a>. Sending email at scale is a very specialized function that requires domain expertise. SparkPost abstracts this complexity by providing a managed service that customers can integrate with.</p> 
<p>There are two kinds of emails that enterprises usually send. The first is called “bulk email”, this usually includes announcements about new product launches, newsletters, and other similar items. Sending bulk email is an inherently “bursty” workload that could lead to scaling problems if self-managed. This need for elastic scalability is one of the problems that SparkPost solves by running on AWS.</p> 
<p>The second kind of email is called “triggered email,” and it’s the kind that app developers most often want to send. Emails of this kind usually are API-driven and include common service and app use cases such as password changes and other security notifications, new registration and onboarding emails, and transactional receipts.</p> 
<p>Relying on an email delivery service to send both bulk and triggered email is an effective way to reduce operational overhead and increase the success of email delivery. As a SparkPost customer you can leverage the SparkPost libraries to trigger emails from your application. See the figure below for a code sample in Python:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h6 style="text-align: center"><img class="size-full wp-image-5029 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/11/SeptRoundup5.png" alt="" width="975" height="376" />Image used with permission</h6> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>An email delivery system cannot be a fire-and-forget system because the senders will not be able to measure success. SparkPost provides a near real time monitoring dashboard for the emails that were sent. This helps the sender measure the success, as well as fine tune the email strategy in future. The way email works today, the sender has no control or visibility beyond the first hop, so how does SparkPost measure success? SparkPost includes tracking info in the email that is triggered when the user opens a message or clicks on a link. This is combined with other relevant data and shown to the sender in a dashboard. Additionally, SparkPost takes it further by optionally enabling Webhooks to call your own endpoints for further analysis.</p> 
<p>When you start measuring your email marketing campaigns, one of the first challenges you will notice is the delivery to success ratio. You may be sending emails, but your Internet Service Provider (ISP) might not be delivering them because of low email sender reputation. The email sender reputation is a score assigned by the ISP, and if it’s low, the ISP might be sending your emails to a Junk folder or even reject the emails outright. Several factors determine the score, like the number of emails sent by the organization, how often emails hit the spam trap, number of email bounces and so on. SparkPost helps you improve your email reputation by <a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/deliverability/ip-warm-up-overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warming the IP address</a>, <a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/what-are-feedback-loops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">managing feedback loops</a>, and by following to <a href="https://www.m3aawg.org/sites/default/files/document/M3AAWG_Senders_BCP_Ver3-2015-02.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">best practices</a> listed here.</p> 
<p>Inbox delivery success criteria, security and many more aspects of email delivery are detailed in <a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/resources/white-papers-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SparkPost documentation</a>. Once you are ready, you can get started with a range of cost-effective plans. SparkPost also offers a free developer account that provides access to all SparkPost features and up to 15,000 free emails per month.</p>
