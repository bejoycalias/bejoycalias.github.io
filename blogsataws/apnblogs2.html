<p>At Amazon Web Services (AWS), we understand that our government and education customers have unique challenges they must overcome to improve the lives of citizens and students around the world.</p> 
<p>Members of the AWS Partner Network (APN) who attain the AWS Government or Education Competency get special access benefits, event specific benefits, and go-to-market opportunities to reach AWS customers and prospects.</p> 
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/partner-solutions/">AWS Government Competency Partners</a></strong> provide solutions to—and/or have deep experience working with—government customers to deliver mission-critical workloads and applications on AWS.</li> 
<li><strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/education/partner-solutions/">AWS Education Competency Partners</a></strong> have demonstrated industry expertise and solutions aligning with AWS architectural best practices for teaching and learning, administration, and academic research efforts.</li> 
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/competencies/">AWS Competency Program</a> spotlights APN Partners that have demonstrated technical proficiency and proven customer success in specialized solution areas.&nbsp;We launched the AWS Government Competency in 2016, and in 2017 we announced the AWS Education Competency.</p> 
<b>Benefits of the Public Sector Partner&nbsp;Program</b>

<li>Access to co-branded materials and exclusive AWS Competency Certificate</li> 
<li>Inclusion in APN Partner Spotlights</li> 
<li>Direct access to&nbsp;APN Reference Team</li> 
<li>Inclusion in internal AWS Sales Enablement Training as a Preferred Partner via company logo</li>

For example, at the 2017 Washington, DC, summit we hosted events that allowed Competency Partners to meet with AWS leadership, held the first annual Competency Advisory Council, and showcased our AWS Competency Partners in video testimonials that are broadcast and promoted through AWS channels.</p> 
<p>Hear from our APN Partners about how the Government Competency has <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/one-year-later-the-value-of-the-aws-government-competency-for-apn-partners-and-customers/">benefited their businesses</a>.</p> 
<b>Watch: New AWS Public Sector Competency Partner Videos</b> 
<p>We are excited to debut nine new AWS-produced videos, highlighting the practices of AWS Public Sector Competency Partners that have benefited from the APN and the AWS Competency Program. These APN Partners have worked with us to build their solutions and practices, and these videos are showcased on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd6MoB9NC6uYN2grvUNT-Zg">AWS YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>New offerings include AWS digital training and a new entry-level certification called AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner. Plus, we have added several new Partner Training courses that are specifically designed to help AWS Partner Network (APN) Partners address customer needs with AWS solutions.</p> 
<b>New&nbsp;AWS Digital Training</b> 
<p>You can get unlimited access to more than 100 new digital training courses built by AWS experts at <a href="https://www.aws.training/">aws.training</a>. Digital courses are generally 10 minutes long and designed to help you build foundational knowledge for dozens of AWS services and solutions.

<li>Deep dives on Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, and Amazon EBS</li> 
<li>Migrating and Tiering Storage on AWS</li> 
<b>How to Enroll as an APN Partner</b> 
<p>As an APN Partner, you can access digital training at <a href="https://www.aws.training/">aws.training</a>. Enrollment is separate from all the AWS Partner Accreditation and Solutions Training courses you already have access to as an APN Partner. <strong>Be sure to sign in with your Partner Central credentials</strong> so you can access all of your training in one place.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.aws.training/Subscription">Enroll now for digital training &gt;&gt;</a></p> 
<b>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</b> 
<p>Our newest certification exam, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/">AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</a>, enables individuals with an overall understanding of the AWS Cloud to validate their knowledge with an industry-recognized credential. It covers four domains: cloud concepts, security, technology, and billing and pricing.</p> 
<p>To help you prepare for this exam, take our new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/cloud-practitioner-essentials/">AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials</a> course, which is included in the new AWS digital training courses available now. This course provides an overview of cloud concepts, AWS services, security, architecture, pricing, and support.</p> 
<p>As an APN Partner, we recommend you take the new Cloud Practitioner training and certification exam <strong>after</strong> you earn either AWS Business or Technical Accreditation.</p> 
<b>New Solutions Training Courses</b> 
<p>We have expanded our Solutions Training for Partners courses to help you identify and address customer business requirements. Training is designed to meet the needs of both business and technical roles, and is generally offered in both digital and classroom formats. Partner training courses are offered at no cost at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/cloud-practitioner-essentials/">aws.training</a>. <strong>Remember to sign in with your Partner Central credentials</strong>.</p> 
<p>Here are some new courses available at no cost to APN Partners. Each of these are available in both Business and Technical versions:</p> 
<li>SAP on AWS</li> 
<li>Migrating to AWS</li> 
<li>AWS for Windows</li> 
<li>Amazon Connect</li>

<p>We are proud to announce the launch of <strong>APN Badge Manager</strong>—a tool that allows Standard-tier and above APN Partners to access, manage, and create custom badges to showcase the APN Program designations and AWS Competencies that your company holds.</p> 
<p>Over the past several years, we have received a number of requests from APN Partners to help make sense of the program logos we make available to them upon attainment of new program designations. Previously, there were more than 2,000 potential badge combinations between a partner’s APN Program tier (Premier, Advanced, or Standard), partner type (Consulting or Technology), and designations&nbsp;such as&nbsp;AWS Public Sector Partner Program, AWS Managed Service Provider (MSP) Program, or specific AWS Competencies.</p> 
<p>With APN Badge Manager, APN Partners can build customized badges to suit different&nbsp;communications goals. The tool will dynamically create an APN Badge with up to five program components. If you have more than five, you can create multiple APN Badges to suit each use case. For example, you can create one APN Badge to showcase your APN Program level and another&nbsp;badge to showcase your APN Competencies.</p> 
<p><a href="https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/SiteLogin">To get started, login to APN Partner Central and select the Badge Manager link on the left menu &gt;&gt;</a></p> 
<b>How it Works</b> 
<p>The tool&nbsp;is available to the Alliance Lead contact in APN Partner Central for all Standard-tier and above APN Partners. It&nbsp;contains both a Badge Library and Badge Builder tab.</p> 
<p>The Badge Library provides access to a partner’s default badges, as well as custom badges that were previously created. The Badge Builder allows a partner to select up to five eligible program elements to appear in a custom badge, as well as select the order in which they would like each element to appear.</p> 
<p>Upon achievement of a new program designation, a default badge is automatically created by the tool, and placed in the Badge Library tab for immediate download.</p> 
<p>All default and custom badges are also automatically updated when a partner moves from tier to tier. APN Badges are made available for download in the EPS file format. The EPS format is a versatile, scalable, and high-resolution vector format that can be converted into other formats using a number of different tools.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b>Resources</b> 
<p>To get started, login to <a href="https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/SiteLogin">APN Partner Central</a> and select the Badge Manager link on the left menu.</p>

A valid Partner Central login is required for access, and you can search for “badge manager” to access the document quickly.</p>

<p><em>By Mandus Momberg, Partner Solutions Architect at AWS</em></p> 
<p>As customers continue to extend applications into the cloud, leveraging a consistent on-premises and cloud platform helps manage resources through a familiar interface across both environments.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-servicebroker-documentation/wiki">AWS Service Broker</a> is a new open source project that allows APN Partners to integrate AWS services directly into their solutions. Customers can then deploy AWS services without leaving the application platform of choice. Built around the industry standard <a href="https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/">Open Service Broker API</a>, the AWS Service Broker can be seamlessly integrated with any platform which has adopted the API specification.</p> 
<p>Users of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, for example, can provision AWS services directly from the platform without interfacing with the AWS API. Learn more about our <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/latest-version-red-hat-openshift-container-platform-joins-infrastructure-and-services-across-hybrid-cloud-environments">collaboration with Red Hat</a> as the first APN Partner to leverage AWS Service Broker.</p> 
<p>Currently, the AWS Service Broker supports 10 native AWS services with more to be added in the near future. The supported services are:</p> 
<li>Amazon DynamoDB</li> 
<li>Amazon ElastiCache</li> 
<li>Amazon EMR</li> 
<li>Amazon Route 53</li> 
<li>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)</li> 
<li>Amazon Redshift</li> 
<li>Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</li> 
<li>Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)</li> 
<li>Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)</li> 
<li>Amazon Athena</li> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/29/AWS-Service-Broker.png" /></p> 
<p>With the AWS Service Broker, you can provision AWS services such as Amazon RDS directly from the application platform and seamlessly bind the database to your app. The AWS Service Broker securely provides your application with the connection string and credentials required to connect to the managed Amazon RDS instance.</p> 
<p><a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-servicebroker-documentation/wiki">See&nbsp;our documentation to learn more about deploying the AWS Service Broker &gt;&gt;</a></p>

<p><em>By Ash Mazhari, Global Lead, Artificial Intelligence for AWS Marketplace</em></p> 
<p>AWS Marketplace now has a machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) discovery&nbsp;page that makes it easier to buy software from vendors that are integrated with or running on Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mp/ai">Visit the AWS Marketplace ML and AI discovery page &gt;&gt;</a></p> 
<p>The discovery page features software providers for a variety of data engineer, data scientist, and developer use cases, and helps you select the right products faster by showcasing products within the following subcategories:</p> 
<li>Data Services</li> 
<li>Machine Learning and Data Science Tools</li> 
<li>Intelligent APIs and Solutions</li> 
<p>The new&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/partner-solutions/">AWS Machine Learning Competency</a> was announced at the Global Partner Summit at AWS re:Invent 2017, and we are proud to highlight the featured AWS Marketplace sellers who have earned the&nbsp;ML Competency: Alteryx, Domino, SigOpt, Trifacta, and Veritone. These vendors, and more, offer more than 60 products on AWS Marketplace to help you solve ML and AI challenges, including data ingestion, preprocessing, hosting, model building, tuning, testing, optimization, computer vision, neuro-linguistic programming, and more.</p> 
<p>The ML and AI solutions you can purchase on AWS Marketplace are billed to your AWS account rather than billed separately by the vendor. You can pay as you go, and with AWS Marketplace, you can easily manage all your software subscriptions in one place.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mp/ai/"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/28/Marketplace-ML-and-AI-page-977x1024.png" /></a></p> 
<b>Amazon’s Investment in ML and AI</b> 
<p>Amazon has invested deeply in artificial intelligence for more than 20 years, and many of the capabilities customers experience each day are driven by machine learning. Amazon.com’s recommendations engine is driven by ML, for example, as are the paths that optimize robotic picking routes in our fulfillment centers.</p> 
<p>Our supply chain, forecasting, and capacity planning are also informed by ML algorithms. Alexa is fueled by Natural Language Understanding and Automated Speech Recognition deep learning, as is our drone initiative, Prime Air, and the computer vision technology in our new retail experience, Amazon Go.</p> 
<p>At AWS, we’re focused on bringing that knowledge and capability to you through three layers of the AI stack:</p> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/#ai_frameworks">Frameworks and infrastructure</a> with tools like Apache MXNet and TensorFlow</li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/#ai_services">API-driven services</a> to quickly add intelligence to applications</li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/#ai_platforms">Machine learning platforms</a> for data scientists</li> 
<p>Now, AWS Marketplace offers customers an even greater variety of AI and ML tools to meet their needs thanks to startups and independent software vendors that have quickly adapted to the market need for ML and AI solutions. Many of these vendors are&nbsp;offer a variety of tools that are available on AWS Marketplace.</p> 
<b>Getting Started</b> 
<p>With AWS Marketplace, you can navigate, discover, purchase, and deploy the software needed to process data, build and optimize ML and AI models, and build intelligent applications to fuel innovation.</p> 
<p>Get started using ML and AI tools and building intelligent applications by visiting the new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mp/ai">AWS Marketplace ML and AI discovery page</a>.</p>
