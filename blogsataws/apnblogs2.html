<p><strong><em>By Brad Lyman, Principal Product Manager at AWS</em></strong></p> 
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5313" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/14/AWS-Marketplace_border-300x150.png" alt="AWS Marketplace_border" width="300" height="150" />AWS Marketplace, which has over 4,000 software listings from more than 1,250 popular software vendors across 35 product categories, announced that customers can now receive specific pricing and end-user license terms with Seller Private Offers.</p> 
<p>With this feature, software sellers participating in the Enhanced Data Sharing (EDS) program can extend to any AWS account a version of their product, enabling volume discounts through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace">AWS Marketplace</a>. This means AWS customers can enjoy all the same benefits of consolidated billing, cost analysis, and subscription management of AWS Marketplace while paying a lower privately negotiated price visible only to that customer and the seller.</p> 
<p>The following information will help you start supporting customer specific pricing and end-user license terms with Seller Private Offers:</p> 
<h3><strong>Do you sell Amazon Machine Image (AMI) or SaaS products on AWS Marketplace?</strong></h3> 
<p>If so, you can now offer customers specific offers through AWS Marketplace. As customers make larger commitments, they often request special pricing or end-user license terms. AWS now makes it possible for customers to receive private offers with pre-negotiated pricing and end-user license terms directly through AWS Marketplace. This new feature&nbsp;is available to any AWS Marketplace software seller participating in the EDS program that compensates their sales team for AWS Marketplace sales.</p> 
<h3><strong>What&nbsp;about APN Partners who want to increase sales through AWS Marketplace?</strong></h3> 
<p>As a seller, you will be able to use AWS Marketplace to reach more customers. With Seller Private Offers, you can offer custom pricing and end-user license terms on your customers’ existing AWS bill. You’ll be attracting customers who have chosen AWS Marketplace due to the ease of finding, purchasing, and deploying solutions. Customers can quickly review your end-user license agreement, subscribe through AWS Marketplace, and receive a single bill for all their software purchases through AWS Marketplace.</p> 
<h3><strong>What does the release of Seller Private Offers mean for customers?</strong></h3> 
<p>Customers get a simple way to receive specific pricing and end-user license terms through AWS Marketplace. This makes it easier to consolidate more of their purchase on their AWS bill and take advantage of consolidated billing, cost analytics, and renewal management. Customers can lower their software costs while buying through AWS Marketplace. They can also receive a specific end-user licensing agreement to cover any required custom terms.</p> 
<h3><strong>What is the EDS program and how do I enroll?</strong></h3> 
<p>The AWS Marketplace Enhanced Data Sharing (EDS) program focuses on delivering “enhanced” buyer information, such as buyer email domain, AWS Account ID, and location, on a daily and monthly basis to select AWS Marketplace Sellers. The goal of delivering buyer information is to provide a framework for sellers to compensate their sales teams for AWS Marketplace subscription revenue.</p> 
<p>Sharing monthly billed revenue information, usage information, and disbursed funds information by buyer provides a mechanism to help you correctly map deals and opportunities to the appropriate sales representative by company, geography, and AWS Account ID. This program requires that the data only be used to activate and motivate AWS Marketplace Seller field sales via formal sales compensation plans.</p> 
<p>For more information regarding the program and how to enroll, contact <a href="mailto:aws-marketplace-seller-ops@amazon.com">aws-marketplace-seller-ops@amazon.com</a>.</p> 
<h3><strong>How do I get started with Seller Private Offers?</strong></h3> 
<p>We’ve made it easy for you to deliver private offers to your customers. To extend a private offer on one of your existing AWS Marketplace products, you only need to provide your customer’s account numbers (their payer account and any sub-accounts), the product code you’d like to discount, and the new product price. You can also share an offer duration (how long the price is good for) and a new EULA as a PDF. The AWS Marketplace Customer Business Desk will share the private offer’s URL with you and your customers. The URL is only visible after signing in with the provided account, meaning only your customer can see the price and EULA meant for them. They can then subscribe at any time prior to the offer’s expiration.</p> 
<h3><strong>How do I learn more?</strong></h3> 
<p>To learn more about using Seller Private Offers on AWS Marketplace, reach out to your AWS Marketplace Category Manager or the AWS Marketplace Managed Catalog Operations team.</p>

<p><strong><em>By Thomas Robinson, Solutions Architect at AWS</em></strong></p> 
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5268" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/11/10/Security-Icon-300x150.png" alt="AWS Security Icon" width="300" height="150" />AWS Partner Network (APN) Partners new to managed services often have questions about how to protect their customers from social engineering attacks and how to best test themselves to meet APN Program requirements. In this post, we’ll provide guidance for APN Partners&nbsp;and inform customers on what to expect from their Managed Service Provider (MSP).</p> 
<p>A large part of an AWS Solutions Architect’s role is helping customers maintain a robust security posture that follows best practices. An entire pillar of our <a href="https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS_Well-Architected_Framework.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Well-Architected Framework</a>, which we use to help validate our customer’s critical workloads, is dedicated to security. We work with next-gen <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/partners/msp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS MSP Partners</a> and ensure they maintain secure environments.</p> 
<p>To join the AWS MSP Program, an APN Partner undergoes a third-party validation audit to demonstrate they are following AWS best practices for securing cloud environments. While part of meeting these controls is technical, the support aspect of a managed services engagement includes a very human element. Items such as 24/7 call centers, helpdesk and escalation e-mails, or chat systems are all an attack surface which a malicious party can use to disrupt a business, or gain additional information useful in another type of attack.</p> 
<p>To validate that our AWS MSP Partners are protecting these vulnerable areas, they must identify their attack surface, and then test potential attacks, as seen in the AWS MSP Validation Checklist under Control 8.1.9:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>“Partner performs secret shopper testing on vectors vulnerable for social engineering attacks, including call, chat and email systems. User validation should not utilize confidential data like social security numbers, or personal security questions.”</em></p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>In the same way a traditional&nbsp;MSP is responsible for the physical security of your datacenter, a next-gen&nbsp;MSP is an AWS customer’s trusted resource for helping maintain their portion of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shared Responsibility Model</a>. Instead of physical keys, the MSP is their customer’s gatekeepers into the cloud, providing secure access methods and enforcement of change processes.</p> 
<h3><strong>Best Practices and Anti-Patterns for Identifying and Minimizing Attacks</strong></h3> 
<p>Before building a process for testing, APN Partners should identify exactly what vulnerabilities may exist, and follow best practices to reduce or eliminate the impact of a support channel being an attack vector.</p> 
<h4><strong>Federated Access for the AWS Console</strong></h4> 
<p>Managing access to the AWS Console via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Identity and Access Management</a> (IAM) covers the entire lifecycle, including creating, providing credentials for, and disabling users. Alternatively, by using a SAML provider for access to the AWS Console, an MSP can allow their customers or MSP Support Staff to use their own <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-saml.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAML-based federation IdP for accessing the AWS Console</a>. This eliminates the need for the MSP to create a support process for resetting passwords and MFA devices, and allow the customer to directly manage their own users through existing processes.</p> 
<h4><strong>Temporary Credentials for Users</strong></h4> 
<p>To use services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon S3</a>) or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, developers and engineers need access keys with the minimum permissions necessary in accounts managed by the MSP. AWS provides options to manually create and destroy access keys for IAM users. Although access keys are still used, we recommend users take advantage of temporary credentials provided by the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS), which has the capability of automatically rotating credentials.</p> 
<p>Like console access, developers and engineers can be provided temporary credentials via <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html#CreatingSAML-configuring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAML-based federation for API access</a>. This is a common AWS best practice, as automated key rotation reduces the chance your credentials will be exposed and vulnerable in the wild. For MSPs, this eliminates the need for a process to issue and rotate keys for end customers.</p> 
<h4><strong>Temporary Credentials for Applications</strong></h4> 
<p>Applications running&nbsp;on AWS also need AWS credentials to use our services. These credentials should be short lived, automatically rotated as they expire, and adhere to the principals of least privilege. By providing <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IAM Roles applied to an Instance Profile</a>, developers can create applications on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (Amazon EC2) using the AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK) without the need to securely store and rotate Access Keys in a configuration file.</p> 
<h4><strong>Consider Non-AWS Resources</strong></h4> 
<p>Apart from access to AWS APIs, MSPs should minimize the need for manual interaction with other customer access tasks such as maintaining authentication for SSH or RDP. By using the Amazon EC2 Run Command you can gate routine access to servers by authenticating users via IAM to execute commands instead of accessing them directly with SSH keys or passwords. For secrets management, the MSP should consider the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/systems-manager/parameter-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parameter Store</a> feature to provide a self-service place for customers to keep their configuration data such as database strings and passwords, which is also gated by IAM authorization.</p> 
<h4><strong>Security-as-Code</strong></h4> 
<p>As companies move towards more frequent self-service deployments, the change control process for approving changes shifts away from a manual review towards a pre-approved, well-defined, and frequently reviewed configuration. For example, PCI DSS Requirement 1 includes controls such as environments containing cardholder data should not be allowed access to the public internet or untrusted networks, allowing only necessary traffic. These rules should be included as part of your deployment processes to automatically validate that releases meet defined standards. Maintaining a high security environment and deploying frequently are not mutually exclusive.</p> 
<h3><strong>Testing Considerations</strong></h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h4><strong>Detecting and Preventing Unauthorized Changes</strong></h4> 
<p>It is important to identify what changes a user may request from support channels and test the authorization for those changes, as well as ensuring controls around high-impact changes are enforced. Using our previous example of security-as-code, a single requestor should not have authorization to change the definition of acceptable traffic. Testing that appropriate change control review is followed and a requestor cannot bypass this by making an “urgent” support call maintains the integrity of your compliance controls.</p> 
<h4><strong>Preventing Data Leakage</strong></h4> 
<p>Even with a support structure where minimal change could be requested over channels such as phone or email, interaction via these methods can be used to extract information about a customer or their environment. Extracting information such as service endpoints, application platforms, or architecture details can help an attacker craft a more intelligent technical attack on customer applications. Always ensure sensitive information is communicated over appropriate channels, such as a support portal secured by multi-factor authentication.</p> 
<h4><strong>Protecting Against Email and Spear Phishing</strong></h4> 
<p>Helpdesk emails, specific engineering contact, and known escalation paths are some of the various ways attackers will try and compromise security. Using these paths, an attacker can attempt to enact unauthorized changes, gain additional information, or perform a technical attack by installing malware on an engineer’s device. These support channels should have a technical validation of the requestor, such as directing requests through a password and MFA protected portal, and avoid using personal details such as social security numbers or a challenge question.</p> 
<h4><strong>Testing Insider Threats</strong></h4> 
<p>Testing should be tuned to mitigate against insider threats, whether an existing employee exceeding their authority or a disgruntled former employee attempting to regain access. Tests should be crafted to assume an attacker may have a level of insight to processes such as escalation email paths or phone numbers. As such, it’s important to ensure you have safeguards around these paths and are testing them regularly.</p> 
<h3><strong>Building a Testing Process</strong></h3> 
<p>Once attack vectors have been identified and minimized, a robust process for testing can be built. This pairs technology solutions to perform phishing style attacks with human driven testing. Some APN Partners train resources to perform tests internally and dedicate time producing actionable output from those exercises. Other APN Partners engage with consulting firms focused on security to help them build a testing plan as well as provide resources for carrying out those tests. For APN Partners focused on customers in verticals with strict compliance or security requirements, such as financial services or healthcare, this investment in a third-party validation can provide a stronger position when customers are reviewing potential managed services providers.</p>

<p><em>By Ian Scofield, Juan Villa, and Mike Ruiz, Partner Solutions Architects at AWS</em></p> 
<p>This is the second post in our series documenting a project to fix issues with the GameDay architecture by using tenets of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Well-Architected Framework</a>. See <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/testing-aws-gameday-with-the-aws-well-architected-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Part 1 of the series</a>&nbsp;for an overview of the process, a description of the initial review, and a list of the critical findings identified by the review team.</p> 
<p>In this post, we’ll cover the steps we took to fix the critical findings identified by the review team. In future posts, we will share our plans to refine our architecture through continuous improvement and collaboration with AWS solutions architects.</p> 
<b>Findings</b> 
<p>As noted in Part 1 of the serires, the review team delivered a list of critical findings we needed to prioritize and fix immediately, as well as a list of non-critical ideas that we should consider addressing in our roadmap for the GameDay architecture.</p> 
<p>Here were the critical items:</p> 
<li>The legacy administrative scripts for GameDay use AWS access keys and secret access keys that are stored in plain text in an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon DynamoDB</a> table.</li> 
<li>The load generator is a single instance in a single <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Availability Zone</a>&nbsp;(AZ) without any recovery options configured.</li> 
<li>The disaster recovery (DR) plan is not clearly defined, and the recovery point objectives (RPO) and recovery time objectives (RTO) are not set. Also, the disaster recovery plan isn’t periodically tested against the RPO and RTO objectives.</li> 
<p>The review team noted they would welcome a chance to review plans for remediation before implementation, so we set to work analyzing the deficiencies, documenting our plans, and making a rough estimate of the level of effort required to implement the fixes before making any changes.</p> 
<p>Here is the high-level remediation plan we came up with to address the critical findings, in order of priority:</p> 
<li><strong>Implement the use of cross-account roles to eliminate the usage of access and secret keys.&nbsp;</strong><br /> A quick review of the code suggested that we should allocate one day to develop and test cross-account access, and another day to update the instructions and train staff on the new feature. Since this fix seemed relatively simple and provided both security and operational benefits, we decided to set it as the highest priority to be integrated into the new design.</li> 
<p></p> 
<li><strong>For the load generator, move from a single instance to a container model that would allow for a clustered deployment.&nbsp;</strong><br /> This change was a little more complicated than the previous access key fix. We needed to modify our application to store state in DynamoDB instead of writing locally, and we needed to package our various applications and binaries into Docker containers. We planned to create an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EC2 Container Service</a> (Amazon ECS) task definition and service for each of these components, which would take care of the scheduling and task placement for us. Switching to DynamoDB and containers would enable us to move our hard-coded configuration to an Auto Scaling group launch configuration, remove all hard-coded values in favor of variables set at launch, and use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS CloudFormation</a> templates for the deployment mechanism.<p></p> <p>These changes would net considerable improvements and have little impact on the overall flow of the game, although we did have to update the load management tool and game setup scripts to use DynamoDB and the Auto Scaling group rather than a static configuration file.We allocated two weeks to develop and test these new features, and one week to update our documentation and train staff on the new operation.</p></li> 
<li><strong>Create a disaster recovery plan and validate it.<br /> </strong>Automating our infrastructure deployment with Amazon ECS and Auto Scaling groups simplified our disaster recovery plan, but it wasn’t a complete solution. There were still gaps in our recovery process and furthermore, having a solution but not testing it, or, at a minimum, walking through various scenarios, would leave us vulnerable to process gaps when the time came to put the plan into action. We allocated an additional week to create the plan, and an additional day to verify that all contingencies were covered and rehearsed.</li> 
<p>We shared our plans with the review team before starting this work, to ensure that we were on the right track to meet all the requirements. The review team gave us the thumbs up, and we began putting our plan into action.</p> 
<b>Initial analysis and rearchitecture</b> 
<p>Although the list seemed straightforward, we quickly realized that these items pointed to a common underlying problem: our architecture was very simplistic, dated, and did not make good use of the modern features provided by the AWS platform. When we initially built GameDay, we focused on functionality and built an environment based on previous experience. However, the architecture didn’t really embrace modern tools or techniques, like the notion of building for failure, and anticipating the need for better disaster recovery capabilities.</p> 
<p>With this in mind, we realized that we should attack this core architectural issue, which would, in turn, solve a majority of the critical findings as well as a large number of the non-critical recommendations. To achieve this, we moved from a single instance load generator to Docker containers running in an Amazon ECS cluster (see diagram below). This immediately gave us the benefit of a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-AZ</a> architecture and the ability to scale our infrastructure and handle the loss of components. We also modified additional services from the load generator to be run as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Lambda</a> functions, which handle scaling and infrastructure management automatically.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5136" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/10/19/WA1.png" alt="" width="600" height="255" /></p> 
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Updated Amazon ECS architecture</em></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>While pursuing this new architecture, we realized that our previous deployment process involved manual creation of resources and configuration. We took a hard stance from the start to treat our infrastructure as code and used AWS CloudFormation to define our environment. This allowed us to easily version our infrastructure as we progressed through the remediation phase, and also played a critical role in developing our new disaster recovery plan.</p> 
<b>Remediation</b> 
<h3>Issue 1: AWS access keys</h3> 
<p>Surprisingly, this item turned out to be the easiest to address. AWS provides a feature to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enable role-based access between accounts</a>. Since we had already automated the configuration of both the admin and player accounts with AWS CloudFormation, it seemed simple to update the template to create a role rather than an access/secret key pair in the player account.</p> 
<p>We initially thought it would be a massive undertaking to modify our entire code base to use sts:AssumeRole, but this turned out to be trivial. Because we used the AWS SDKs, and both access keys and IAM roles are part of the default credential provider chain and fully supported by the SDK, the only change we had to make was to remove the access keys and pass in the role ARN to assume.</p> 
<h3>Issue 2: Load generator</h3> 
<p>We solved this issue by moving from a single EC2 instance to an Amazon ECS cluster. To do this, we had to modify the application to externally store team and player data. Since we were already using Amazon DynamoDB for other metadata, we chose it for this purpose as well. Moving the state to DynamoDB and polling for configuration was essential, as the load generator containers were now ephemeral, and we didn’t want to create a new service to track members, but just to push updates.</p> 
<p>Amazon ECS enabled us to operate our load generator as a service within Amazon ECS, so we could scale the application throughout the game without having to manage a complex, distributed, configuration management tool. It also provided us with additional fault tolerance by scheduling and placing tasks across three Availability Zones, and replacing containers in the event of any errors or failures.</p> 
<h3>Issue 3: Disaster recovery</h3> 
<p>Disaster recovery was by far the most difficult remediation we attempted. The issues were not solely technical in that we had developed plans to expand the use of tools and techniques to rapidly and reliably deploy the application. However, the harder to solve challenges we encountered were things like definitions (How do we define disaster?), expectations (What is a reasonable recovery time objective?), compliance (How often do we test DR? What can we automate? Is our testing framework robust enough to tell us that our DR plan is still valid after a new release?), and ownership (Who is responsible for declaring a disaster? Who is responsible for ensuring that the process is adequately maintained over time?).</p> 
<p>Ultimately, we decided on a phased, incremental approach rather than tackling all of these issues at once. We allocated one day to strategize a response to a simulated disaster that focused on a simulated event—loss of control of a production account—and another day to write up our findings.</p> 
<p>The simulated test involved members of the team sitting in a room with a moderator responsible for presenting a scenario, and then simulating the recovery process with whatever materials we had at hand. The moderator would keep us honest, challenge responses, and add details as the scenario progressed. The recovery team would keep careful notes, identify gaps, lucky breaks, and areas for improvement, and ultimately document our effective RTO and RPO.</p> 
<p>Given the scenario—total loss of control of our production account—we quickly decided that the only safe response available to us was to abandon ship and simulate recovery in an entirely new account. We happened to have an unused, largely unconfigured account we could use for this purpose, but it was clear that account creation and initial setup would need to be accounted for in our RTO. The deployment of the game assets in the new account was significantly eased by the use of the new CloudFormation templates, which, luckily, were stored in an S3 bucket owned by another AWS account that was unaffected by the breach.</p> 
<p>Much more problematic was the recovery of the game data stored in DynamoDB. Our current backup plan was manually operated and pushed backups to an S3 bucket in the same account and AWS Region as the source data. Obviously, an attacker that had control of our primary account would also have control of our only backups. Since the backups weren’t automated and were inaccessible in the event we lost control of our account, our RPO could never be clearly defined. Simply put, we could not assure a successful recovery in this scenario.</p> 
<p>Despite these challenges, we deemed the DR simulation to be very successful. We were able to test recovery, identify what was working (decoupling data, automating deployment with AWS CloudFormation), what needed work (automated DynamoDB backups and audit logging to an S3 bucket in a different account), and what our current, achievable RTOs and RPOs were.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, we added the recovery and audit work to our immediate roadmap, and agreed on a future cadence of quarterly DR simulations to continue to investigate our real response capability as changes were made and new disasters were contemplated.</p> 
<b>Conclusion</b> 
<p>We started this process with an architecture that, now looking back, was very fragile and left us vulnerable both from a security and a disaster recovery standpoint. It was uncomfortable to have our shortcomings identified, but by having knowledgeable AWS solutions architects walk through our architecture and point out areas for improvement, we were able to document and prioritize changes. This allowed us to take a step back and examine where we needed to focus our efforts in order to provide a better experience for our customers by mitigating potential problems down the road. We now are much more confident in our architecture and know that we are better prepared for failure.</p> 
<p>However, our GameDay application is far from perfect, as we found out in our disaster recovery simulation. Additionally, we still have recommendations on our roadmap from the initial review. As AWS comes out with new features, and best practices are updated, we’ll continue to work with other solutions architects to ensure that we are incorporating these features and practices into our architecture.</p> 
<p>In the next post, we’ll take a look at what happened six months after we implemented the changes discussed in this post, considering that AWS released new features during that time. We’ll walk through our evaluation process of these new features to see where they can be incorporated. Additionally, we’ll discuss how we continued to work with our review team on the non-critical items.</p>

<p><em>This month, Partner Solutions Architects Tim Mattison, Roy Rodan, and Claudine Morales highlight offerings from AWS Technology Partners Cesanta, GorillaStack, and GuardiCore.</em></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Cesanta, by Tim Mattison</h3> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5122 alignright" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/10/13/cesanta.png" alt="" width="368" height="127" />In Internet of Things (IoT) systems, it is important to be able to build, test, and secure systems with minimal friction.&nbsp; Customers need a way to get hardware that they can use to rapidly develop and test IoT solutions.&nbsp; <a href="https://cesanta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cesanta</a>, creator of Mongoose OS, which we highlighted in our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/partner-sa-roundup-may-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May Partner SA Roundup</a>, is in the business of providing streamlined tools that simplify the onboarding process and unblock developers. &nbsp;Recently, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grid-Connect-GC-ESP32-AWS-SK-ConnectSense-Mongoose/dp/B07562GY9G" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they released their own hardware kit based on Espressif’s ESP32 platform</a>, which provides a known-good component for customers to design, develop, and deploy IoT solutions.</p> 
<p>The ESP32 is the successor to the ESP8266 IoT board, and it comes with several enhancements: &nbsp;520K of RAM, a dual-core 240 MHz processor, new security features, 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth support.</p> 
<p>The faster processor means customers are able to efficiently do more time-sensitive compute operations at the edge. The ESP32 is powerful enough to perform digital signal processing (DSP) operations on input signals, and even decode QR codes in real time from its camera interface.</p> 
<p>Additional storage allows customers to add more features to their edge devices. This space can also be used to buffer data while the device is offline, store logs for debugging, or store a backup firmware image to allow for more robust over-the-air firmware deployments.</p> 
<p>Bluetooth v4.2 and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) let the ESP32 interact with Bluetooth devices and sensors. With Mongoose OS, the ESP32 can even act as a <a href="https://mongoose-os.com/ble-wifi-gateway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BLE gateway to AWS IoT</a>.</p> 
<p>On the security side, the ESP32 supports secure boot, flash encryption, and cryptographic hardware acceleration. Secure boot prevents tampering with the flash contents. Flash encryption protects the flash contents from being read in plaintext. Cryptographic hardware acceleration allows devices to connect to the cloud faster. These features allow customers to build secure IoT devices.</p> 
<p>If you’re looking to build a new IoT solution, I’d invite you to take a look at the ESP32.&nbsp; For more information, please head on over to Cesanta’s <a href="https://cesanta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> to learn more about their new hardware kit and Mongoose OS.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>GorillaStack, by Roy Rodan</h3> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5123 alignright" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/10/13/GorillaStack.png" alt="" width="327" height="55" />Managing cloud infrastructures can be tedious when it’s done manually. In the AWS Cloud, customers are able to use services like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS CloudTrail</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon CloudWatch</a> to help with these tasks. GorillaStack is an AWS Partner that enables DevOps and IT teams to keep track of events in their AWS environments by using simple rules, so they are always up-to-date on the usage and cost of their resources.</p> 
<p>Configuring rules in GorillaStack involves three simple steps:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Identifying the accounts to manage using cross-account AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles</li> 
<li>Defining triggers based on time, cost, server, or volume status</li> 
<li>Specifying the action to be taken</li> 
</ol> 
<p>GorillaStack enables customers to apply these rules to resources across all AWS accounts and Regions. For example, the following image shows a rule set up to delete all detached <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Elastic Block Store</a> (Amazon EBS) volumes in a particular AWS Region:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5124 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/10/13/GorillaStack2.png" alt="" width="806" height="206" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Another helpful GorillaStack feature is its Slack and HipChat integration. This integration makes it even easier to digest events and alerts from CloudTrail and CloudWatch. Instead of having to crawl through CloudTrail or CloudWatch logs for one specific event, you can configure a chatbot to send real-time alerts to a channel or to a specific group of Slack or HipChat users based on any CloudTrail or CloudWatch event. The alert can be expanded to reveal the raw log content, so your DevOps team can take the right actions, as seen here:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5125 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/10/13/GorillaStack3.png" alt="" width="975" height="290" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This Slack and HipChat integration also enables you to receive alerts on scheduled actions before the events take place, so you can delay or cancel these actions. For instance, let’s say you schedule an action to stop development instances from running during the night in order to reduce costs. An alert is sent to a Slack channel to inform you of the upcoming action, and you can then decide if the shutdown process should proceed, snooze, or cancel.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5126 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/10/13/GorillaStack4.png" alt="" width="739" height="156" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>GuardiCore, by Claudine Morales</h3> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5127 alignright" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/10/13/GuardiCore.png" alt="" width="366" height="94" />As part of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Shared Responsibility Model</a>, customers are responsible for their security configuration in the AWS cloud. This responsibility involves determining ways to protect and monitor network traffic, which can include obtaining internal workload visibility, effective east-west traffic policy management, and active breach detection and response. GuardiCore, an AWS Technology Partner, offers the Centra Security Platform to help bridge these gaps.</p> 
<p>Once Centra agents are installed on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, the Centra Security Platform performs an application discovery process and collects network traffic data, including layer 7 communication activities among applications running on these instances. The Centra user interface displays a map of all network processes, applications, and traffic flows, giving you the ability to easily visualize everything that is occurring in your network at any given time. &nbsp;This same approach can be applied to your on-premises infrastructure, to give you a centralized view of your entire data center, regardless of location.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5128 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/10/13/GuardiCore2.png" alt="" width="975" height="548" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Centra Security Platform provides micro-segmentation capabilities to give you more granular control over access policies. For instance, it can restrict access to a certain service not only by IP address and port number but also by process name.</p> 
<p>Centra also helps safeguard environments from potential breaches by using multiple intrusion detection and prevention methods. One of these methods involves reputation analysis, where domain names, IP addresses, and file hashes that have been associated with malicious behavior are detected and eliminated instantaneously. Another method involves real-time dynamic deception, in which an attacker, when detected, is redirected to a GuardiCore-hosted deception environment where they continue to execute their attack, thinking that they have successfully penetrated the customer’s infrastructure.</p> 
<p>Inside the deception environment, the attacker’s actions are logged, recorded, and even screenshotted, to enable analysis and insight on their motives and techniques. This allows customers to implement changes to prevent further intrusions from the attacker. &nbsp;The information on the attacker’s actions is also added to the GuardiCore Reputation Service database to enable detection of similar breach attempts in the future.</p> 
<p>To learn more about the GuardiCore Centra Security Platform, visit the GuardiCore website or <a href="https://www.guardicore.com/request-a-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">request a demo</a>.</p>

<p>Identity is not a new concept. There’s a large list of useful tools and technologies that effectively address the authentication and authorization needs of applications. However, for software as a service (SaaS) providers, the identity universe becomes a bit more complicated. SaaS extends the notion of identity, adding new kinds of roles and access considerations that shape and influence the fabric of your SaaS solutions.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/saas/identity-with-cognito/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SaaS Identity and Isolation with Amazon Cognito Quick Start</a>, which was recently published, equips developers with a full working solution that digs into the nuances of injecting tenant identity into SaaS applications. This Quick Start addresses a broad range of SaaS identity topics with specific emphasis on illustrating how tenant context is introduced via Amazon Cognito and used in combination with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to scope access to tenant resources.</p> 
<p>A key goal of this Quick Start is to create a model where user and tenant identity are merged into a unified model that flows seamlessly through your application’s architecture. The following diagram highlights the conceptual model underlying the Quick Start architecture.</p> 
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-5112 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/10/11/saas1.png" alt="" width="590" height="341" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Quick Start introduces a model where, through Amazon Cognito, a user’s identity is bound to a tenant’s identity to create the notion of a SaaS identity. This SaaS identity is then treated as a first-class construct, and delivers all the context that is needed to represent both the user and any tenant attributes that may be needed to control and scope that user’s experience.</p> 
<p>This is realized in a reference application that orchestrates all the moving parts associated with building a multi-tenant SaaS environment on AWS. This application was developed with an AngularJS client and a series of Node.js microservices to simulate the workflows of a simplified order management system. The goal was to provide a reference application that illustrates how identity influences all the different dimensions of your SaaS environment. Some of the key capabilities of this solution include:</p> 
<li>Reduced tenant on-boarding and tenant activation friction</li> 
<li>Provisioning of tenant-specific IAM roles and policies</li> 
<li>Support for multiple user roles, including both system and tenant roles</li> 
<li>Ability to manage system and tenant users</li> 
<li>Tenant-scoped access to application infrastructure, including database access operations.</li> 
<li>Use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to flow SaaS identity (and scoping) into each application microservice</li> 
<li>Use of Amazon API Gateway and custom authorizers to scope and control access to application microservices</li> 
<li>Illustration of identity in a pooled multi-tenant model where tenants share infrastructure</li> 
<p>The application’s infrastructure includes a number of AWS services and constructs to create a highly scalable, highly available SaaS identity and isolation solution that conforms to best practices for deploying a container-based application in a virtual private cloud (VPC) that spans two Availability Zones. The following diagram provides a view of the environment that is provisioned by the Quick Start:</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5113" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/10/11/saas2.png" alt="" width="917" height="597" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Quick Start also includes a detailed <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-reference/saas/identity/cognito/latest/doc/saas-identity-and-isolation-with-cognito-on-the-aws-cloud.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide</a> that digs into the conceptual and architectural elements of the application. The guide outlines the steps associated with deploying and running the complete solution. Exploring this document will give you a better sense of the nature of the solution and the complexities of implementing a robust identity and isolation model in a SaaS environment.</p> 
<p>This solution represents one of multiple options for addressing SaaS identity, and should provide a good foundation of concepts and implementation considerations that can accelerate your efforts to introduce identity into your SaaS environment. It also provides detailed insights into some of the fundamental mechanisms that you can use to improve the security of your SaaS environment without further complicating the developer experience.</p>

<h3>Showcasing Innovative Solutions Focusing on Governance, Risk &amp; Compliance (GRC)</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The Financial Services industry is highly regulated, with an increasing need to break the trade-off between compliance and innovation. With the surge in data and new business models, managing security, risk, and compliance have become increasingly complex, driving requirements for enhanced security mechanisms, complex financial calculations, and advanced analytics to simulate evolving market conditions. Faced with the limitations of their on-premises agility, storage, and computing capabilities, financial institutions of all sizes—FinTech startups, hedge funds and asset managers, insurers, commercial banks, and global investment banks, among others—are working with AWS and its AWS Partner Network (APN) Partners to become more agile, cost-effective, and customer-centric.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Post by Sabari Radhkrishnan, a SAP Partner Solutions Architect at AWS</em></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) and SUSE have been working together for years to bring SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) to our joint SAP customers. Since 2012, when <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/sap-start-the-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS first certified its platform</a> for SAP workloads, including SAP HANA One, customers have been using the SLES operating system to run their SAP applications on AWS. When AWS certified its instances for SAP HANA in 2014, customers started using SLES for their SAP HANA deployments on AWS as well. In 2015, SLES for SAP was made <a href="https://www.suse.com/newsroom/post/2015/suse-linux-enterprise-server-for-sap-applications-now-available-on-amazon-web-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available in AWS</a> through SUSE’s bring-your-own-subscription program; and in 2016, SLES for SAP became <a href="https://www.suse.com/newsroom/post/2016/suse-boosts-business-flexibility-by-expanding-availability-of-suse-linux-enterprise-server-for-sap-applications-in-aws-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available in AWS Marketplace</a> as an on-demand image, so our existing and new customers could easily get started with their mission-critical SAP workloads.</p> 
<p>As part of our continuing efforts to provide our joint SAP customers with the best experience, we are pleased to announce today that SLES for SAP will become available in AWS Marketplace as an AWS offering in Q4 2017. This will be the second joint listing from AWS and SUSE after SLES, which was launched almost seven years ago. With the release of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/x1-instances-for-ec2-ready-for-your-memory-intensive-workloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X1</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-ec2-instances-with-4-tb-of-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X1e</a> instances, which are purpose-built for in-memory workloads such as SAP HANA, we are seeing that more customers are choosing to run SAP workloads in development, test, and production on AWS.</p> 
<p>The new SLES for SAP listing will make it easier for customers to run SAP workloads on AWS, because they will receive joint support from AWS and SUSE, and the new offering will be priced competitively. SUSE and AWS will continue to work together to enhance and optimize the OS for SAP workloads on AWS.</p> 
<p>SLES for SAP includes the High Availability Extension (HAE), which allows SAP HANA instances to seamlessly fail over between Availability Zones. The software also includes other enhancements such as page cache management and kernel settings that are optimized for SAP workloads. In addition, SLES for SAP images carry extended service pack support so customers can run the next-to-last service pack for up to 18 months. You can find more details about the benefits of using SLES for SAP on the <a href="https://www.suse.com/products/sles-for-sap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SUSE website</a>.</p> 
<p>Customers can easily get started with SLES for SAP for their SAP HANA workloads by using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/sap-hana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Quick Start for SAP HANA</a>. This Quick Start helps provision and configure the infrastructure required to deploy SAP HANA in less than an hour, following best practices from AWS, SAP, and SUSE.</p> 
<p>Customers can continue to leverage SUSE’s <a href="https://www.suse.com/solutions/public-cloud/#bring-your-own" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bring-your-own-subscription program</a> to use their existing subscriptions to run their SAP workloads on AWS; see&nbsp;<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/suse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">aws.amazon.com/suse</a> for details.

<p>Diagnosing the medical mysteries behind acutely ill babies can be a race against time, filled with a barrage of tests and misdiagnoses. During the first few days of life, a few hours can save or seal the fate of patients admitted to the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Accelerating the analysis of the medical assays conducted in these hospitals can improve patient outcomes, and, in some cases, save lives.</p> 
<p>Precision medicine relies on the aggregate of these types of tests (and others) to advance healthcare. Due to decreasing costs and faster turnaround times, genome sequencing is one such test that is gaining adoption throughout healthcare. Understanding a patient’s genetic predisposition to different diseases is fundamental to establishing a medical risk baseline. In certain cases, such as in NICUs, a patient’s genetic profile can unlock the specific cause of a disease and inform the subsequent medical interventions that might work.</p> 
<p>Today, we’d like to tell you about two of our AWS Partner Network (APN) Partners, DNAnexus and Edico Genome, who are working together to advance the principles of precision medicine, and are already changing lives through genomics.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Introducing DNAnexus</h3> 
<p><a href="https://www.dnanexus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNAnexus</a>, an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/health/life-sciences-partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Life Sciences Competency Partner</a>, offers data management, next-generation sequencing data analysis, and secure collaboration for large-scale life sciences enterprises. The DNAnexus platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solution provides a secure and unified system that scales to meet its clients’ unique needs, such as merging de-identified clinical data with genetic data. The API-based DNAnexus platform enables customers (e.g., pharma, researchers, hospitals) to create custom workflows to analyze genomics data as they see fit, such as to develop new drugs or diagnose rare diseases.</p> 
<p>Naturally, the data generated by these processes is sensitive and its protection is paramount. DNAnexus has architected their platform to align with <a href="https://www.dnanexus.com/product-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">key security and compliance frameworks</a>, such as HIPAA, 21 CFR Part 11, CLIA, and FedRAMP.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Introducing Edico Genome</h3> 
<p><a href="http://www.edicogenome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edico Genome</a>, an APN Standard Tier Partner and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/f1/partners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EC2 F1 Instance Partner</a>, is focused on facilitating the growth of precision medicine. By accelerating one of precision medicine’s central components, genome sequencing analysis, without sacrificing accuracy, Edico Genome enables researchers and clinicians to understand the relationships between genetic variation and disease.</p> 
<p>Edico Genome accelerates sequencing analysis by using field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, in its Dynamic Read Analysis for GENomics (<a href="http://www.edicogenome.com/dragen-bioit-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DRAGEN</a>) solution. In contrast to conventional CPU-based systems, which must execute lines of software code to perform an algorithmic function, FPGAs use logic circuits to accelerate algorithms and provide outputs almost instantaneously. By replicating these logic circuits thousands of times over, DRAGEN is able to achieve industry-leading speeds by allowing for massive parallelism—unlike CPUs, which are limited to running only one task per core. FPGAs are also fully reconfigurable, allowing users to quickly switch between different functions and pipelines</p> 
<p>Today, Edico Genome is deployed on our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/f1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FPGA-based Amazon EC2 F1 instances</a> and can process a whole genome sequence in about 70 minutes on an f1.2xlarge instance type and about 30 minutes on an f1.16xlarge instance type. These speeds can be over 10 times faster than current state-of-the-art algorithms.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>How they’re working together</h3> 
<p>Recently, DNAnexus and Edico Genome <a href="http://www.edicogenome.com/edico-genome-launches-dragen-dnanexus-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced a joint partnership</a> to integrate Edico Genome’s DRAGEN solution, deployed on Amazon EC2 F1 instance family, into the DNAnexus platform. This integration gives customers the ability to leverage the speed of DRAGEN to analyze genomes coming from high-throughput sequencers, while also inheriting the security and compliance controls that DNAnexus has implemented. At a high level, here’s what this collaboration looks like:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5075 aligncenter" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb/2017/09/26/DNAnxusEdico1.png" alt="" width="975" height="471" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>DNAnexus ingests raw data (called base calls or reads) from genome sequencers such as Illumina’s NovaSeq. These reads are fed into DRAGEN, which is running on an EC2 F1 instance, to speed up the identification of genome variations that can influence disease progression. Results are stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon S3</a>) using industry-standard compression algorithms. Depending on the use case, customers can then collaborate across research sites while adhering to the regulatory requirements around sensitive data by using the capabilities built into the DNAnexus platform.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Collaborating to improve clinical care</h3> 
<p><a href="https://www.rchsd.org/programs-services/rady-childrens-institute-for-genomic-medicine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rady Children’s Institute for Genomic Medicine</a> is one of the global leaders in advancing precision medicine. To date, the institute has sequenced the genomes of more than 3,000 children and their family members to diagnose genetic diseases. 40% of these patients are diagnosed with a genetic disease, and 80% of these receive a change in medical management. This is a remarkable rate of change in care, considering that these are rare diseases and often involve genomic variants that have not been previously observed in other individuals.</p> 
<p>The institute <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170503005939/en/DNAnexus-Powers-Genome-Analysis-Network-Rady-Children%E2%80%99s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adopted the DNAnexus platform</a> to gain a secure, flexible, and scalable environment for local and distributed sequencing and analysis. Using DNAnexus with DRAGEN provides Rady with a highly optimized, end-to-end, whole genome sequencing analysis solution. Edico Genome’s DRAGEN data analysis pipeline is central to Rady’s ultra-rapid genomic data analysis, because it significantly reduces costs and turnaround time while maintaining accuracy. (Edico and Rady also previously worked together to set a <a href="http://www.edicogenome.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Edico-Genome-Rady-Childrens-White-Paper-March-2017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guinness World Record for fastest genetic diagnosis</a>.)</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><em>“Our goal is to ensure that genome-powered precision medicine is available to every child who needs it. To do this, we needed a rapid research-to-bedside pipeline and be able to scale it and make it accessible to hospitals around the world,” said Stephen Kingsmore, M.D., D.Sc., president and chief executive officer at Rady Children’s Institute for Genomic Medicine. “DNAnexus has the technology and expertise to facilitate this ambitious project, Edico Genome’s rapid testing capability allows for rapid diagnosis of critically ill newborns.”</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Based on the success of this partnership, Rady Children’s Institute is expanding this integrated solution to their partners nationally, fostering a growing genomic database that healthcare providers can access to quickly diagnose rare diseases in children.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Collaborating to advance precision medicine</h3> 
<p>One of the most rewarding things about working in Healthcare and Life Sciences at AWS is seeing how our APN Partners can work together to change the lives of people. The DNAnexus and Edico Genome partnership is one such example that is making a lasting impact on the healthcare industry. We look forward to seeing the results of this partnership advance precision medicine, and deliver results like the ones experienced at Rady Children’s Institute across the clinical landscape.</p>

<h3></h3> 
<h3>Here’s a bit more about each of these new training courses:</h3> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/machine-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Introduction to Machine Learning</a> is a free 40 minute web-based training intended for developers, solution architects, and IT decision makers who already know the foundations of working with AWS. This online course will give an overview of machine learning, walk through an example use case, teach relevant terminology, and walk through the process for incorporating machine learning solutions into a business or product. The course also includes knowledge checks to help validate understanding.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/deep-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Learning on AWS</a> is a one day instructor-led training for developers who are interested in learning more about AWS solutions for deep learning. This course will teach individuals about the deep learning model and give them a roadmap for understanding what challenges deep learning can solve. Solutions related to image recognition, speech recognition, and speech translation are covered.</p> 
<p>We recommend individuals take Introduction to Machine Learning before attending Deep Learning on AWS, but it is not required. In addition, individuals who are looking to learn more about how to leverage data for Deep Learning should consider taking <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/bigdata-fundamentals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Data Technology Fundamentals</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/serverless-datalake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building a Serverless Data Lake</a>.</p> 
<p>APN Partners are eligible for 20% off instructor-led training delivered by AWS. <a href="https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/LmsSsoRedirect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to sign in</a> to the AWS Training and Certification Portal using your APN Portal credentials and browse all of our training offerings</p>
