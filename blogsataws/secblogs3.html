<p>Today, we updated the&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Identity and Access Management</a>&nbsp;(IAM) console to make it easier for you to create, manage, and understand IAM roles. We made improvements that include an updated role-creation workflow that better guides you through the process of creating trust relationships (which define who can assume a role) and attaching permissions to roles. Additionally, you can now view and understand the permissions attached to roles more easily by using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_understand-policy-summary.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">policy summaries</a> for each role in your account.</p> 
<p>In this post, I provide background information about roles, show how to create roles correctly by using the updated <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IAM console</a>, and review other changes to the role list and details pages that help you better manage your roles.</p> 
<h3>Background information about IAM roles</h3> 
<h4><strong>What are IAM roles?</strong></h4> 
<p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IAM roles</a> are a secure way to grant permissions to entities you trust. You can use a role in the following scenarios:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delegating permissions to an AWS service</a> to carry out actions on your behalf (such as <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enhanced Monitoring for Amazon Relational Database Service [RDS]</a>).</li> 
<li>Enabling application code running on an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EC2</a> instance to access or modify AWS resources (such as data stored in an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon S3</a> bucket).</li> 
<li>Granting access to users from another AWS account.</li> 
<li>Enabling <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/manage-federation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">federated sign-in</a> to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Management Console</a> for employees in your corporate directory.</li> 
</ul> 
<h4><strong>What are the different parts of an IAM role?</strong></h4> 
<p>As illustrated in the following diagram, roles have two types of policies attached to them:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Trust policy</strong> – This policy defines the entities that can assume a role. When you create a role by using the IAM console, the trust policy is created for you. You can customize the trust policy after it has been created. A role can have only one trust policy.</li> 
<li><strong>Permissions policies</strong> – These policies define which AWS resources a role can access and the actions it can perform on those resources. These <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">policies</a> can be AWS managed policies, customer managed policies, or inline policies attached directly to the role. You can attach multiple permissions policies to an IAM role.</li> 
</ul>

<p style="padding-left: 30px"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4862 size-full" title="IAM role diagram with trust policy and permissions policy" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/09/06/RM1-0917-diagram-b.png" alt="IAM role diagram with trust policy and permissions policy" width="700" height="305" /></p> 
<h3>How do I use an IAM role?</h3> 
<p>Roles can be used to access AWS both programmatically and via the AWS Management Console.</p> 
<h4>Using a role to access AWS programmatically</h4> 
<p>You can <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/assume-role.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">assume a role programmatically by using the AWS CLI or SDK</a>. When you assume a role, the role issues <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">temporary security credentials</a>&nbsp;that you can use to access resources and call AWS service actions. Using roles enables you to follow the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html#use-roles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">security best practice</a> to use temporary security credentials instead of long-term security credentials.</p> 
<p>If you are using AWS services such as EC2 or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Lambda</a>, you can assign a role to your EC2 instance or Lambda function. Your code running on either the instance or function will then be able to access AWS using the short-term credentials from that role. These services automatically assume the role and use the returned credentials to enable you to access resources or perform actions. Learn more about <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IAM roles for EC2</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-identity-based.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IAM roles for Lambda</a>.</p> 
<h4>Using a role to access the AWS Management Console</h4> 
<p>You can also assume a role to access an account in the AWS Management Console by using <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-console.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Switch Role</a> functionality. You can access this functionality by using the drop-down menu in the upper right corner of the console or through a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_enable-console-custom-url.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">custom sign-in URL</a>. To switch roles, you must sign in as either an IAM or federated user. Swith Role is not supported for root users.</p> 
<h3>Introducing the updated role-creation workflow</h3> 
<p>To make it easier to create IAM roles, we’ve updated the role-creation workflow in the IAM console. To introduce the new experience, let’s look at a specific example.</p> 
<p>Let’s suppose I am developing a new application running on an EC2 instance that reads and writes image data to S3. To enable that application to access the S3 bucket where the image data is stored, I need to create a new role that the EC2 instance running my application code can assume. This role trusts EC2 (defined in the trust policy) and has permissions to read and write to S3 (defined in the permissions policy).</p> 
<p>I first navigate to the <strong>Roles</strong> page of the IAM console, and choose <strong>Create role</strong>.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4843 size-full" title="Screenshot of choosing &quot;Create new role&quot;" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/09/06/0-create-role-a.png" alt="" width="893" height="459" /></p> 
<p>I then select the type of trusted entity this role will allow. I have four options in this step:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>AWS service</strong> – To grant access to an AWS service to manage resources in my account.</li> 
<li><strong>Another AWS account</strong> – To grant access to my account from another account.</li> 
<li><strong>Web identities</strong> – To grant access to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Cognito</a> or other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenID Connect</a>&nbsp;providers.</li> 
<li><strong>SAML</strong> – To grant access to identities from a SAML-enabled identity provider.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>For this example, I choose <strong>AWS service</strong>. I then see a list of AWS services the new role could trust. Because I need a role that can be assumed by an EC2 instance, I choose <strong>EC2</strong>. This opens a section below it with specific use cases for this service. I choose the&nbsp;<strong>EC2 (Allows EC2 instances to call AWS services on your behalf)</strong> use case. This defines the role’s trust policy to include EC2 as an entity that can assume that role.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4844 size-full" title="Screenshot of choosing the type of trusted entity" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/09/06/1-trust.png" alt="" width="925" height="841" /></p> 
<p>Then, I set the permissions that the role needs to access S3. I already created a permissions policy that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/writing-iam-policies-how-to-grant-access-to-an-amazon-s3-bucket/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grants access to my S3 bucket</a> and named it <strong>MyImageApp-S3Access. </strong>I choose that policy and choose <strong>Next</strong> to move to the final step.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4846 size-full" title="Screenshot showing the MyImageApp-S3Access permissions policy" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/09/06/2-permissions-a.png" alt="Screenshot showing the MyImageApp-S3Access permissions policy" width="900" height="516" /></p> 
<p>In the final step, I name the role <strong>MyImageAppRole</strong> and describe it this way: “Allows application code running on EC2 instances to access data in S3.” I choose <strong>Create role </strong>and I am done! I can now attach this role to EC2 instances on which my application is running to give them permissions to access data in S3.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4852 size-full" title="Screenshot of finishing the role creation process" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/09/06/3-review-a.png" alt="Screenshot of finishing the role creation process" width="900" height="550" /></p> 
<h3>Other updates to help you manage your roles</h3> 
<p>With this update, you will see a new column called <strong>Trusted entities</strong> on the <strong>Roles</strong> list page. This column allows you to review at a glance which entities can assume a role. This makes it easier to identify roles that trust a specific account or AWS service. It also makes it easier to audit the trust relationships across all your roles. You also can add other columns to this table, including <strong>Creation time</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Role ARN</strong>,&nbsp;by clicking the gear icon. Your column selection preference will be remembered when you return to the <strong>Roles</strong>&nbsp;page.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4847 size-full" title="Screenshot of the Roles page with new column, &quot;Trusted entities&quot;" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/09/06/list-roles.png" alt="Screenshot of the Roles page with new column, &quot;Trusted entities&quot;" width="891" height="554" /></p> 
<p>To help you understand the permissions attached to your role, we’ve also updated the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab to include <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/move-over-json-policy-summaries-make-understanding-iam-policies-easier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IAM policy summaries</a>. Policy summaries make it easier for you to understand the permissions for IAM permissions policies attached to roles without having to view a policy’s JSON.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4849 size-full" title="Screenshot of the updated &quot;Permissions&quot; tab" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/09/06/role-details-a.png" alt="Screenshot of the updated &quot;Permissions&quot; tab" width="900" height="577" /></p>

<p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/directory_simple_ad.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simple AD</a>, which is powered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samba &nbsp;4</a>, supports basic Active Directory (AD) authentication features such as users, groups, and the ability to join domains. Simple AD also includes an integrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lightweight Directory Access Protocol</a> (LDAP) server. LDAP is a standard application protocol for the access and management of directory information. You can use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol#Bind_.28authenticate.29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BIND operation</a> from Simple AD to authenticate LDAP client sessions. This makes LDAP a common choice for centralized authentication and authorization for services such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secure Shell</a> (SSH), client-based virtual private networks (VPNs), and many other applications. Authentication, the process of confirming the identity of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_(computer_security)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">principal</a>, typically involves the transmission of highly sensitive information such as user names and passwords. To protect this information in transit over untrusted networks, companies often require encryption as part of their information security strategy.</p> 
<p>In this blog post, we show you how to configure an LDAPS (LDAP over SSL/TLS) encrypted endpoint for Simple AD so that you can extend Simple AD over untrusted networks. Our solution uses <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elastic Load Balancing</a> (ELB) to send decrypted LDAP traffic to <a href="http://www.haproxy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HAProxy</a> running on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EC2</a>, which then sends the traffic to Simple AD. ELB offers integrated certificate management, SSL/TLS termination, and the ability to use a scalable EC2 backend to process decrypted traffic. ELB also tightly integrates with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Route 53</a>, enabling you to use a custom domain for the LDAPS endpoint. The solution needs the intermediate HAProxy layer because ELB can direct traffic only to EC2 instances. To simplify testing and deployment, we have provided an&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/awslabs/cloudformation-ldaps-haproxy-template/raw/master/cloudformation/ldaps-haproxy.template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS CloudFormation template</a> to provision the ELB and HAProxy layers.</p> 
<p>This post assumes that you have an understanding of concepts such as <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</a> and its components, including subnets, routing, Internet and network address translation (NAT) gateways, DNS, and security groups. You should also be familiar with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launching EC2 instances and logging in to them with SSH</a>. If needed, you should familiarize yourself with these concepts and review the solution overview and prerequisites in the next section before proceeding with the deployment.</p> 
<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>This solution is intended for use by clients requiring an LDAPS endpoint only. If your requirements extend beyond this, you should consider accessing the Simple AD servers directly or by using <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/directory_microsoft_ad.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Directory Service for Microsoft AD</a>.</p> 
<h3>Solution overview</h3> 
<p>The following diagram and description illustrates and explains the Simple AD LDAPS environment. The <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/cloudformation-ldaps-haproxy-template/raw/master/cloudformation/ldaps-haproxy.template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CloudFormation template</a> creates the items designated by the bracket (internal ELB load balancer and two HAProxy nodes configured in an Auto Scaling group).<span id="more-4647"></span></p> 
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4662 size-full" title="Diagram of the the Simple AD LDAPS environment" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/08/28/Screen-Shot-2017-07-25-at-10.30.54-AM.png" alt="Diagram of the the Simple AD LDAPS environment" width="692" height="895" /></p> 
<p>Here is how the solution works, as shown in the preceding numbered diagram:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>The LDAP client sends an LDAPS request to ELB on TCP port 636.</li> 
<li>ELB terminates the SSL/TLS session and decrypts the traffic using a certificate. ELB sends the decrypted LDAP traffic to the EC2 instances running HAProxy on TCP port 389.</li> 
<li>The HAProxy servers forward the LDAP request to the Simple AD servers listening on TCP port 389 in a fixed Auto Scaling group configuration.</li> 
<li>The Simple AD servers send an LDAP response through the HAProxy layer to ELB. ELB encrypts the response and sends it to the client.</li> 
</ol> 
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Note:</strong> Amazon VPC prevents a third party from intercepting traffic within the VPC. Because of this, the VPC protects the decrypted traffic between ELB and HAProxy and between HAProxy and Simple AD. The ELB encryption provides an additional layer of security for client connections and protects traffic coming from hosts outside the VPC.</p> 
<h3>Prerequisites</h3> 
<ol> 
<li>Our approach requires an Amazon VPC with two public and two private subnets. The previous diagram illustrates the environment’s VPC requirements. If you do not yet have these components in place, follow these guidelines for setting up a sample environment: 
<ol type="a"> 
<li>Identify a region that supports <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/other-directories-pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simple AD</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/classicloadbalancer/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ELB</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2015/12/introducing-amazon-vpc-nat-gateway-a-managed-nat-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NAT gateways</a>. The NAT gateways are used with an Internet gateway to allow the HAProxy instances to access the internet to perform their required configuration. You also need to identify the two <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html">Availability Zones</a> in that region for use by Simple AD. You will supply these Availability Zones as parameters to the CloudFormation template later in this process.</li> 
<li>Create or choose an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon VPC</a> in the region you chose. In order to use Route 53 to resolve the LDAPS endpoint, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-dns.html#vpc-dns-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make sure you enable DNS support</a> within your VPC. Create an <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet gateway</a> and attach it to the VPC, which will be used by the NAT gateways to access the internet.</li> 
<li><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Route_Tables.html#CustomRouteTable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create a route table</a> with a default route to the Internet gateway. Create two <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-nat-gateway.html#nat-gateway-creating" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NAT gateways</a>, one per Availability Zone in your public subnets to provide additional resiliency across the Availability Zones. Together, the routing table, the NAT gateways, and the Internet gateway enable the HAProxy instances to access the internet.</li> 
<li>Create two private routing tables, one per Availability Zone. Create two private subnets, one per Availability Zone. The dual routing tables and subnets allow for a higher level of redundancy. Add each subnet to the routing table in the same Availability Zone. Add a default route in each routing table to the NAT gateway in the same Availability Zone. The Simple AD servers use subnets that you create.</li> 
<li>The LDAP service requires a DNS domain that resolves within your VPC and from your LDAP clients. If you do not have an existing DNS domain, follow the steps to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zone-private-creating.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create a private hosted zone</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zone-private-associate-vpcs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">associate it with your VPC</a>. To avoid encryption protocol errors, you must ensure that the DNS domain name is consistent across your Route 53 zone and in the SSL/TLS certificate (see Step 2 in the “Solution deployment” section).</li> 
</ol> </li> 
<li>Make sure you have completed the&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/prereq_simple.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simple AD Prerequisites</a>.</li> 
<li>We will use a self-signed certificate for ELB to perform SSL/TLS decryption. You can use a certificate issued by your preferred certificate authority or a certificate issued by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/acm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Certificate Manager</a> (ACM).<br /> <strong>Note:</strong> To prevent unauthorized connections directly to your Simple AD servers, you can modify the Simple AD security group on port 389 to block traffic from locations outside of the Simple AD VPC. You can find the security group in the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EC2 console</a> by creating a search filter for your Simple AD directory ID. It is also important to allow the Simple AD servers to communicate with each other as shown on <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/prereq_simple.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simple AD Prerequisites</a>.</li> 
</ol> 
<h3>Solution deployment</h3> 
<p>This solution includes five main parts:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Create a Simple AD directory.</li> 
<li>Create a certificate.</li> 
<li>Create the ELB and HAProxy layers by using the supplied CloudFormation template.</li> 
<li>Create a Route 53 record.</li> 
<li>Test LDAPS access using an Amazon Linux client.</li> 
</ol> 
<h3>1. Create a Simple AD directory</h3> 
<p>With the prerequisites completed, you will create a Simple AD directory in your private VPC subnets:</p> 
<ol type="a"> 
<li>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Directory Service console</a> navigation pane, choose&nbsp;<strong>Directories</strong>&nbsp;and then choose&nbsp;<strong>Set up directory</strong>.</li> 
<li>Choose&nbsp;<strong><strong>Simple AD.<br /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-4679 size-full" title="Screenshot of choosing &quot;Simple AD&quot;" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/08/28/CWJL1-a.png" alt="Screenshot of choosing &quot;Simple AD&quot;" width="600" height="559" /><br /> </strong></strong></li> 
<li>Provide the following information: 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Directory DNS</strong> – The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fully qualified domain name</a> (FQDN) of the directory, such as&nbsp;<span style="font-family: courier">corp.example.com</span>. You will use the FQDN as part of the testing procedure.</li> 
<li><strong>NetBIOS name</strong> – The short name for the directory, such as&nbsp;<span style="font-family: courier">CORP</span>.</li> 
<li><strong>Administrator password</strong> – The password for the directory administrator. The directory creation process creates an administrator account with the user name&nbsp;<span style="font-family: courier">Administrator </span>and this password. Do not lose this password because it is nonrecoverable. You also need this password for testing LDAPS access in a later step.</li> 
<li><strong>Description</strong> – An optional description for the directory.</li> 
<li><strong>Directory Size</strong> – The size of the directory.<br /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-4680 size-full" title="Screenshot of the directory details to provide" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/08/28/CWJL2-a.png" alt="Screenshot of the directory details to provide" width="800" height="367" /></li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li>Provide the following information in the&nbsp;<strong>VPC Details&nbsp;</strong>section, and then choose&nbsp;<strong>Next Step</strong>: 
<ul> 
<li><strong>VPC</strong> – Specify the VPC in which to install the directory.</li> 
<li><strong>Subnets</strong> – Choose two private subnets for the directory servers. The two subnets must be in different Availability Zones. Make a note of the VPC and subnet IDs for use as CloudFormation input parameters. In the following example, the Availability Zones are <span style="font-family: courier">us-east-1a</span> and <span style="font-family: courier">us-east-1c</span>.<br /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-4682 size-full" title="Screenshot of the VPC details to provide" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/08/28/CWJL3-a.png" alt="Screenshot of the VPC details to provide" width="800" height="241" /></li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li>Review the directory information and make any necessary changes. When the information is correct, choose&nbsp;<strong>Create Simple AD</strong>.</li> 
</ol> 
<p style="padding-left: 30px">It takes several minutes to create the directory. From the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Directory Service console</a>&nbsp;, refresh the screen periodically and wait until the directory <strong>Status</strong>&nbsp;value changes to&nbsp;<span style="font-family: courier">Active</span> before continuing. Choose your Simple AD directory and note the two IP addresses in the <strong>DNS address</strong> section. You will enter them when you run the CloudFormation template later.</p> 
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Note:</strong> Full administration of your Simple AD implementation is out of scope for this blog post. See the documentation to add <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/creating_ad_users_and_groups.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users, groups</a>, or <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/join_a_directory.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instances</a> to your directory. Also see the previous blog post, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-manage-identities-in-simple-ad-directories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Manage Identities in Simple AD Directories</a>.</p> 
<h3>2. Create a certificate</h3> 
<p>In the previous step, you created the Simple AD directory. Next, you will generate a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenSSL</a>. You will use the certificate with ELB to secure the LDAPS endpoint. OpenSSL is a standard, open source library that supports a wide range of cryptographic functions, including the creation and signing of x509 certificates. You then import the certificate into ACM that is integrated with ELB.</p> 
<ol type="a"> 
<li>You must have a system with OpenSSL installed to complete this step. If you do not have OpenSSL, you can install it on Amazon Linux by running the command, <span style="font-family: courier">sudo yum install openssl</span>. If you do not have access to an Amazon Linux instance you can <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create one</a> with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSH access enabled</a> to proceed with this step. Run the command,&nbsp;<span style="font-family: courier">openssl version</span>, at the command line to see if you already have OpenSSL installed. 
<pre><code class="lang-text">[ec2-user@ip-10-21-32-162 ~]$ openssl version

<li>Generate a certificate signing request (CSR) using the <span style="font-family: courier">openssl req</span> command. Provide the requested information for each field. The <strong>Common Name</strong> is the FQDN for your LDAPS endpoint (for example, <span style="font-family: courier">ldap.corp.example.com</span>). The <strong>Common Name</strong> must use the domain name you will later register in Route 53. You will encounter certificate errors if the names do not match. 
<pre><code class="lang-text">[ec2-user@ip-10-21-32-162 tmp]$ openssl req -new -key privatekey.pem -out server.csr
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request.</code></pre> 
<li>Use the&nbsp;<span style="font-family: courier">openssl x509</span> command to sign the certificate. The following example uses the private key from the previous step (<span style="font-family: courier">privatekey.pem</span>) and the signing request (<span style="font-family: courier">server.csr</span>) to create a public certificate named&nbsp;<span style="font-family: courier">server.crt</span>&nbsp;that is valid for&nbsp;365&nbsp;days. This certificate must be updated within 365 days to avoid disruption of LDAPS functionality. 
<pre><code class="lang-text">[ec2-user@ip-10-21-32-162 tmp]$ openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey privatekey.pem -out server.crt

<h3>4. Create a Route 53 record</h3> 
<p>The next step is to create a Route 53 record in your private hosted zone so that clients can resolve your LDAPS endpoint.</p> 
<ol start="1" type="a"> 
<li>If you do not have an existing DNS domain for use with LDAP, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zone-private-creating.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create a private hosted zone</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zone-private-associate-vpcs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">associate it with your VPC</a>. The hosted zone name should be consistent with your Simple AD (for example, <span style="font-family: courier">corp.example.com</span>).</li> 
<li>When the CloudFormation stack is in <span style="font-family: courier">CREATE_COMPLETE</span> status, locate the value of the <span style="font-family: courier">LDAPSURL</span> on the <strong>Outputs</strong> tab of the stack. Copy this value for use in the next step.</li> 
<li>On the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Route 53 console</a>, choose&nbsp;<strong>Hosted Zones</strong>&nbsp;and then choose the zone you used for the <strong>Common Name</strong> box for your self-signed certificate.

</ol> 
<h3>5. Test LDAPS access using an Amazon Linux client</h3> 
<p>At this point, you have configured your LDAPS endpoint and now you can test it from an Amazon Linux client.</p> 
<ol start="1" type="a"> 
<li><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create an Amazon Linux instance</a> with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSH access enabled</a> to test the solution. Launch the instance into one of the public subnets in your VPC. Make sure the IP assigned to the instance is in the trusted IP range you specified in the CloudFormation parameter <span style="font-family: courier">MyTrustedNetwork</span> in Step 3.b.</li> 
<li>SSH into the instance and complete the following steps to verify access. 
<ol> 
<li>Install the <span style="font-family: courier">openldap-clients</span> package and any required dependencies:<br /> <span style="font-family: courier">sudo yum install -y openldap-clients</span>.</li> 
<li>Add the <span style="font-family: courier">server.crt</span> file to the <span style="font-family: courier">/etc/openldap/certs/</span> directory so that the LDAPS client will trust your SSL/TLS certificate. You can copy the file using Secure Copy (SCP) or create it using a text editor.</li> 
<li>Edit the <span style="font-family: courier">/etc/openldap/ldap.conf</span> file and define the environment variables <span style="font-family: courier">BASE</span>, <span style="font-family: courier">URI</span>, and <span style="font-family: courier">TLS_CACERT</span>. 
<ul> 
<li>The value for <span style="font-family: courier">BASE</span> should match the configuration of the Simple AD directory name.</li> 
<li>The value for <span style="font-family: courier">URI</span> should match your DNS alias.</li> 
<li>The value for <span style="font-family: courier">TLS_CACERT</span> is the path to your public certificate.</li> 
</ul> </li> 
</ol> </li> 
</ol> 
<p style="padding-left: 90px">Here is an example of the contents of the file.</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-text">BASE dc=corp,dc=example,dc=com
URI ldaps://ldap.corp.example.com
TLS_CACERT /etc/openldap/certs/server.crt</code></pre> 
<p>To test the solution, query the directory through the LDAPS endpoint, as shown in the following command. Replace <span style="font-family: courier">corp.example.com</span> with your domain name and use the&nbsp;<span style="font-family: courier">Administrator</span> password that you configured with the Simple AD directory</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-text">$ ldapsearch -D &quot;Administrator@<strong>corp.example.com</strong>&quot; -W sAMAccountName=<strong>Administrator</strong></code></pre> 
<p>You should see a response similar to the following response, which provides the directory information in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP_Data_Interchange_Format" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF)</a> for the administrator distinguished name (DN) from your Simple AD LDAP server.</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-text"># extended LDIF
#
# LDAPv3
# base &lt;dc=corp,dc=example,dc=com&gt; (default) with scope subtree
# filter: sAMAccountName=Administrator

<p>You can now use the LDAPS endpoint for directory operations and authentication within your environment. If you would like to learn more about how to interact with your LDAPS endpoint within a Linux environment, here are a few resources to get started:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><a href="https://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/CDS/ag/8.0/Finding_Directory_Entries-Using_ldapsearch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using ldapsearch to locate and retrieve directory entries</a></li> 
<li><a href="https://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/CDS/cli/8.0/Configuration_Command_File_Reference-Command_Line_Utilities-ldapmodify.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using ldapmodify to make changes to directory entries</a></li> 
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Security_Services_Daemon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Managing access with the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD)</a> – SSSD can be used within a Linux environment to authenticate LDAP sessions.</li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3> 
<p>If you receive an error such as the following error when issuing the <span style="font-family: courier">ldapsearch</span> command, there are a few things you can do to help identify issues.</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-text">ldap_sasl_bind(SIMPLE): Can't contact LDAP server (-1)</code></pre> 
<ul> 
<li>You might be able to obtain additional error details by adding the <span style="font-family: courier">-d1</span> debug flag to the <span style="font-family: courier">ldapsearch</span> command in the previous section. 
<pre><code class="lang-text">$ ldapsearch -D &quot;Administrator@corp.example.com&quot; -W sAMAccountName=Administrator –d1</code></pre> 
<li>Verify that the parameters in <span style="font-family: courier">ldap.conf</span> match your configured LDAPS <span style="font-family: courier">URI</span> endpoint and that all parameters can be resolved by DNS. You can use the following <span style="font-family: courier">dig</span> command, substituting your configured endpoint DNS name. 
<pre><code class="lang-text">$ dig ldap.corp.example.com</code></pre> 
<li>Confirm that the client instance from which you are connecting is in the CIDR range of the CloudFormation parameter, <span style="font-family: courier">MyTrustedNetwork</span>.</li> 
<li>Confirm that the path to your public SSL/TLS certificate configured in <span style="font-family: courier">ldap.conf</span> as <span style="font-family: courier">TLS_CAERT</span> is correct. You configured this in Step 5.b.3. You can check your SSL/TLS connection with the command, substituting your configured endpoint DNS name for the string after <span style="font-family: courier">–connect</span>. 
<pre><code class="lang-text">$ echo -n | openssl s_client -connect ldap.corp.example.com:636</code></pre> 
<li>Verify that your HAProxy instances have the status <strong>InService</strong> in the EC2 console: Choose&nbsp;<strong>Load Balancers</strong> under <strong>Load Balancing</strong> in the navigation pane, highlight your LDAPS load balancer, and then choose the <strong>Instances</strong></li> 
</ul> 
<h3>Conclusion</h3> 
<p>You can use ELB and HAProxy to provide an LDAPS endpoint for Simple AD and transport sensitive authentication information over untrusted networks. You can explore using LDAPS to authenticate SSH users or integrate with other software solutions that support LDAP authentication. This solution’s CloudFormation template is <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/cloudformation-ldaps-haproxy-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Today, AWS made improvements to the way you sign in to your AWS account. Whether you sign in as your account’s <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">root user</a> or an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Identity and Access Management</a> (IAM) user, you can now sign in from the AWS Management Console’s homepage. This means that if you sign in as an IAM user, you no longer have to use an account-specific URL. However, the account-specific URL you have used in the past to sign in will continue to work.</p> 
<p>In the new sign-in experience, you can sign in from the home page using either your root user’s or IAM user’s credentials. In the first step, root users enter their email address; IAM users enter their <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/console_account-alias.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">account ID (or account alias)</a>. In the second step, root users enter their password; IAM users enter their user name and password.</p> 
<p>In this blog post, I explain the improvements to the way you sign in to your AWS account as a root user or IAM user. If you use a password manager to help you sign in to your account, you may need to make updates so that it will work with the new sign-in experience.<span id="more-4335"></span></p> 
<h3>The new sign-in experience</h3> 
<p>The new AWS sign-in experience allows both root users and IAM users to sign in using the <strong>Sign In to the Console</strong> link on the AWS Management Consoles’s home page.</p> 
<h4>Step 1: For root users and IAM users</h4> 
<p>As shown in the following screenshot, to sign in as a root user, type the email address associated with the root account. To sign in as an IAM user, type an AWS account ID or account alias. Then choose <strong>Next</strong> to proceed to Step 2.</p> 
<p>If you usually sign in using the same browser and allow the browser to store AWS cookies, you will skip Step 1 on subsequent sign-in attempts. If you regularly switch users or accounts, AWS recommends that you prevent the sign-in page from storing AWS cookies.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4398 size-full" title="Step 1: Sign in as a root user or IAM user" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/07/28/Step-1.png" alt="Step 1: Sign in as a root user or IAM user" width="341" height="448" /></p> 
<h4>Step 2: For root users</h4> 
<p>If you entered the email address associated with the root account in Step 1, you were taken to the second step to sign in to the root account, as shown in the following screenshot. Type the password of the root account and choose <strong>Sign in</strong>. If you enabled <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA) for your root account, you will then be prompted to enter the code from your MFA device. After successful authentication, you will be signed in to the AWS Management Console, and your account’s home page will be displayed.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4399 size-full" title="Step 2: For root users" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/07/28/Step-2-root.png" alt="Step 2: For root users" width="299" height="352" /></p> 
<h4>Step 2: For IAM users</h4> 
<p>If you entered an AWS account ID or account alias in Step 1, you were taken to the second step to sign in as an IAM user, as shown in the following screenshot. Type the user name and password of the IAM user, and choose <strong>Sign in</strong>. If MFA has been enabled for your IAM user, you will then be prompted to enter the code from your MFA device. After successful authentication, your account’s home page will be displayed.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-4538 size-full" title="Step 2: For IAM users" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/08/02/IAM-User-Login-b.png" alt="Step 2: For IAM users" width="336" height="439" /></p> 
<p>With these changes, you may need to make updates to password managers so that they will work with the new sign-in experience.</p> 
<p>If you have comments about the changes to how you sign in to your AWS account as a root user or IAM user, submit a comment in the “Comments” section below. If you have questions, start a new thread on the <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=76" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IAM forum</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact AWS Support</a>.</p>

<p>AWS recently released the first guide in the new AWS Government Handbook Series: <a href="https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_Secure_Network_Connections.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secure Network Connections: An evaluation of the US Trusted Internet Connections program</a>. This new series examines key cybersecurity policy initiatives that have been operating in the traditional IT space, unpacks their security objectives, and identifies lessons learned and best practices of global government first movers and early adopters seeking to achieve the initiative’s security outcomes in the cloud.</p> 
<p>In particular, “Secure Network Connections” provides guidance to government policy makers on AWS’s position and recommendations for establishing cloud-based network perimeter monitoring capabilities. Note that this guidance can be applied to any organization that requires centralized perimeter network monitoring. The guide also summarizes lessons learned from AWS’s work with the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through an analysis of its federal secure network connections program, Trusted Internet Connections (TIC).</p> 
<p>If you have questions or comments about this new guide, submit them in the “Comments” section below. And note that the next guide in this series will be published later this year.</p>

<p>You can help to protect your data in a number of ways while it is in transit and at rest, such as by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or client-side encryption.&nbsp;AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)&nbsp;is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create, control, rotate, and use your encryption keys. AWS KMS allows you to create custom keys, which you can share with&nbsp;AWS Identity and Access Management users and roles in your AWS account or in an AWS account owned by someone else.</p> 
<p>In a new AWS DevOps Blog post, BK Chaurasiya&nbsp;describes a solution for building a cross-region/cross-account code deployment solution on AWS. BK explains options for helping to protect your source code as it travels between regions and between AWS accounts.</p>

<p>I’m pleased to announce that today we’ve launched a new security service,&nbsp;<a title="undefined" href="https://aws.amazon.com/macie/" target="null">Amazon Macie</a>.</p> 
<p>This service leverages machine learning to help customers prevent data loss by automatically discovering, classifying, and protecting sensitive data in AWS. Amazon Macie recognizes sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII) or intellectual property, providing you dashboards and alerts that give visibility into how data is being accessed or moved.&nbsp;This enables you to apply machine learning to a wide&nbsp;array&nbsp;of security and compliance workloads, and we think this will be a significant enabler for you.</p>

<p>To govern <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/manage-federation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">federated access</a> to your AWS resources, it’s a common practice to use <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn579255(v=ws.11).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Active Directory (AD) groups</a>. When using AD groups, establishing federation requires the number of AD groups to be equal to the number of your AWS accounts multiplied by the number of roles in each of your AWS accounts. As you can imagine, this can result in the creation of a very large number of AD groups to manage federated access.</p> 
<p>However, some organizations have limits on how many AD groups they can create. For example, an organization might need to keep its AD group hierarchy reasonably flat and avoid a deep nesting of groups. Such a situation needs a solution that doesn’t require you to create exponentially more AD groups while still allowing you to use access control and automated user integration.</p> 
<p>In this blog post, I provide step-by-step instructions for integrating <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> with <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb897402.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services</a> (AD&nbsp;FS) by using <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms680541.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AD user attributes</a>, allowing you to establish federated access without expanding your total number of AD groups. Your organization’s enterprise administrator probably has existing processes in place for managing AD group memberships and provisioning, and you can extend these processes to the management of AD user attributes and the reduction of your organization’s dependency on AD groups.<span id="more-4464"></span></p> 
<h3>Prerequisites</h3> 
<p>This post assumes:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/enabling-federation-to-aws-using-windows-active-directory-adfs-and-saml-2-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You have a working AD directory and AD&nbsp;FS server</a>.</li> 
<li>You have <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/enabling-federation-to-aws-using-windows-active-directory-adfs-and-saml-2-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">created an identity provider</a> (IdP) in your AWS account using your XML file (<span style="font-family: courier">https://&lt;your-server-name-here&gt;/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml</span>) from your AD&nbsp;FS server. Remember the name of your IdP because you will use it later in this solution.</li> 
<li>You have created the appropriate <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IAM roles</a> in your AWS account, which will be used for federated access.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>After you satisfy these prerequisites, you can proceed to the next section of this post to configure your AD users and AD&nbsp;FS server.</p> 
<h3>Solution overview</h3> 
<p>To benefit fully from the solution in this post, your AD and AD&nbsp;FS environment should look similar to what is shown in the following diagram. I focus this post on AD users and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/technical-reference/the-role-of-claim-rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claim rules</a> in an AD&nbsp;FS server. AD&nbsp;FS claim rules provide the logic to identify who has been correctly set up in AD with the appropriate user attributes to sign in via AD&nbsp;FS to the AWS Management Console.</p> 
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4468" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/07/29/PierreLiddle-Diagram-072917-a.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="498" /></p> 
<p>In the preceding diagram:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>An AD user (let’s call him <span style="font-family: courier">Bob</span>) browses to the AD&nbsp;FS sample site (<span style="font-family: courier">https://<span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>Fully.Qualified.Domain.Name.Here</strong></span>/adfs/ls/IdpInitiatedSignOn.aspx</span>) inside this domain.</li> 
<li>The sign-in page authenticates <span style="font-family: courier">Bob</span> against AD. If <span style="font-family: courier">Bob</span> is already authenticated or using a domain joined workstation, he also might be prompted for his AD user name and password.</li> 
<li><span style="font-family: courier">Bob</span>’s browser receives a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/saml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SAML </a>assertion in the form of an authentication response from AD&nbsp;FS. <span style="font-family: courier">Bob</span>’s access is authorized based on his AD group membership or on AD user attributes configured on his account.</li> 
<li><span style="font-family: courier">Bob</span>’s browser automatically posts the SAML assertion to the AWS sign-in endpoint for SAML (<span style="font-family: courier">https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml</span>). The endpoint uses the&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithSAML.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AssumeRoleWithSAML&nbsp;API</a> to request temporary security credentials and then constructs a sign-in URL for the AWS Management Console using those credentials.</li> 
<li><span style="font-family: courier">Bob</span>’s browser receives the sign-in URL and redirects to the AWS Management Console.</li> 
</ol> 
<b>Deploy the solution</b> 
<h3>A. &nbsp;Configure an AD user’s account</h3> 
<p>Because the AD user attributes hold all the associated AWS account and role information when using this solution, you will start by configuring an AD user’s accounts.</p> 
<p>To edit the user attributes in an AD user’s account:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>On your AD server, in the Active Directory Users and &nbsp;Computers console, go to <strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced Features</strong> in <strong>Active Directory Users and Computers</strong> to see the <strong>Attribute editor </strong>tab.<br /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-4586 size-full" title="Screenshot showing &quot;Advanced Features&quot; in the &quot;View&quot; menu" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/08/06/PL-080817-1.png" alt="Screenshot showing &quot;Advanced Features&quot; in the &quot;View&quot; menu" width="478" height="278" /></li> 
<li>For AD user <span style="font-family: courier">Bob</span>, edit one attribute using the built-in AD attribute editor. The attribute I am using is <span style="font-family: courier">url</span>, which is a multi-valued string. If you use another AD user attribute, consider how you will need to modify your AD&nbsp;FS claim rules later because different attributes may return the values differently back to the AD&nbsp;FS server. The name of the AD user attribute will be used in the AD&nbsp;FS claim rules later in this post.</li> 
<li>Bob has two AWS accounts: <span style="font-family: courier">111122223333</span> and <span style="font-family: courier">444455556666</span>. Each of <span style="font-family: courier">Bob</span>’s AWS accounts has two roles: <span style="font-family: courier">AWS-Dev</span> and <span style="font-family: courier">AWS-ReadOnly</span>. I have configured <span style="font-family: courier">Bob</span>’s <span style="font-family: courier">url</span> attribute with the corresponding values associated with his AWS accounts and roles. As part of the attribute entries, I prefixed each entry with <span style="font-family: courier">AWS-</span> to have a unique identifier. As shown in the following screenshot, I added the entries one at a time so that each value can be returned back to my AD&nbsp;FS server: 
<ul style="margin-left: 30px"> 
<li><span style="font-family: courier">AWS-111122223333-Dev</span></li> 
<li><span style="font-family: courier">AWS-111122223333-ReadOnly</span></li> 
<li><span style="font-family: courier">AWS-444455556666-Dev</span></li> 
<li><span style="font-family: courier">AWS-444455556666-ReadOnly</span></li> 
</ul> </li> 
</ol> 
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><img class="alignnone wp-image-4584 size-full" title="Screenshot of Bob’s &quot;url&quot; attribute with the corresponding values associated with his AWS accounts and roles" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/08/06/PL-080817-2.png" alt="Screenshot of Bob’s &quot;url&quot; attribute with the corresponding values associated with his AWS accounts and roles" width="832" height="577" /></p> 
<ol start="4"> 
<li><span style="font-family: courier">Bob</span> also requires an email address because that information will be used in the role session name when <span style="font-family: courier">Bob</span> signs in to the AWS Management Console via his chosen AWS account and associated role. We use <span style="font-family: courier">Bob</span>’s email address only because it’s a common user attribute most users have and is also unique across users. The unique identifier is then forwarded by AD&nbsp;FS to be used by AWS as a unique value for users. If you have enabled <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS CloudTrail</a>, the role session name is captured in CloudTrail and allows for ease of identification of who assumed the role and subsequent API calls the user or role might have executed on the platform (for example, <span style="font-family: courier">ec2:terminateinstance</span>).<br /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-4520 size-full" title="Screenshot showing Bob's email address" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/07/31/Bob-Email-Address.png" alt="Screenshot showing Bob's email address" width="425" height="564" /></li> 
</ol> 
<p>Now that you have configured <span style="font-family: courier">Bob</span>’s account, you will configure the AD&nbsp;FS server claim rules.</p> 
<h3>B. &nbsp;Configure the AD&nbsp;FS server claim rules</h3> 
<p>Because this blog post assumes your environment is already up and running and to ensure that you can follow along, I am providing <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/awsiammedia/public/sample/ActiveDirectoryUserAttributes/AWS_ADFS_Blog_Sample-Code.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example Windows PowerShell code</a> that you can run on your AD&nbsp;FS server. This code allows you to choose a conventional approach by using AD groups in AD&nbsp;FS claim rules, or for the purposes of this post, to use AD&nbsp;FS claim rules with AD user attributes. If you use the AD group approach on your AD&nbsp;FS server with the example code, your AD group naming convention must be: <span style="font-family: courier">AWS-<strong>YourAccountNumber</strong>–<strong>YourRoleName</strong></span>. If you have already created claim rules for AWS on your AD&nbsp;FS server, I encourage you to run this code against a different AD&nbsp;FS server that has no existing AWS rules.</p> 
<p>To configure the AD&nbsp;FS claim rules:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Open the AD&nbsp;FS console. You can find it by searching for <span style="font-family: courier">ad</span>, as shown in the following screenshot.<br /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-4587 size-full" title="Screenshot of searching for the AD FS console" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/08/06/PL-080817-4.png" alt="Screenshot of searching for the AD FS console" width="344" height="204" /></li> 
</ol> 
<ol start="2"> 
<li>Expand <strong>Trust Relationships</strong> and choose <strong>Relying Party Trusts.<br /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-4588 size-full" title="Screenshot of the &quot;Relying Party Trusts&quot; folder" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/08/06/PL-080817-5.png" alt="Screenshot of the &quot;Relying Party Trusts&quot; folder" width="950" height="216" /><br /> </strong></li> 
</ol> 
<ol start="3"> 
<li>Run the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/awsiammedia/public/sample/ActiveDirectoryUserAttributes/AWS_ADFS_Blog_Sample-Code.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example Windows PowerShell code</a> from the command prompt in the same directory where you extracted the .zip file. The following screenshot shows a list of the example files from the .zip file.<br /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-4484 size-full" title="Screenshot of some example files from the supplied .zip file" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/07/29/PierreLiddle-Image5-072917-a.png" alt="Screenshot of some example files from the supplied .zip file" width="899" height="205" /></li> 
</ol> 
<ol start="4"> 
<li>Run the <strong>01-Configure-ADFS-AD-User-URL-mapping.ps1</strong> Windows PowerShell script to set up the AD&nbsp;FS claim rules. <strong>Note:</strong> Run this script with Administrative permissions. A&nbsp;log file is generated to which you can refer, as shown in the following screenshot.<br /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-4485 size-full" title="Screenshot showing the log file that is generated" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/07/29/PierreLiddle-Image6-072917.png" alt="Screenshot showing the log file that is generated" width="893" height="66" /></li> 
</ol> 
<ol start="5"> 
<li>After you run the Windows PowerShell script, you will see the new relying party trust that has been created in your AD&nbsp;FS configuration for Amazon Web Services, as shown in the following screenshot.<br /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-4589 size-full" title="Screenshot of the new relying party trust that was created by the script" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/08/06/PL-080817-8.png" alt="Screenshot of the new relying party trust that was created by the script" width="946" height="217" /></li>

<p>About these four claim rules:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Claim rule 1 captures the Windows account name of the current user whose attributes will then be queried further with claim rule 3.</li> 
<li>Claim rule 2 captures <span style="font-family: courier">Bob</span>’s email address for use in the role session name.</li> 
<li>Claim rule 3 queries the current user’s URL attributes to identify which account and role the user is authorized to assume access to. These URL attribute values are then stored in a variable (<span style="font-family: courier">http://temp/variable</span>) for use in claim rule 4.</li> 
<li>Claim rule 4 works by matching the first pattern match, <span style="font-family: courier">([^d]{12})</span>, to <span style="font-family: courier">$1</span> and the second pattern match, <span style="font-family: courier">(\w*)</span>, to <span style="font-family: courier">$2</span> for each entry in <span style="font-family: courier">http://temp/variable</span>. With this final rule, you define the resulting value for the AWS role attribute in a dynamic way, which allows the configuration to scale to support virtually&nbsp;any number of AWS accounts and IAM roles without further configuration within AD&nbsp;FS. By using these claim rules, you query, store, and then convert the values in the URL attributes to the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_saml_assertions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IAM role attributes</a> that AWS expects.<img class="alignnone wp-image-4592 size-full" title="Screenshot of editing claim rule 4" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/08/06/PL-080817-11.png" alt="Screenshot of editing claim rule 4" width="891" height="491" /></li>

<p>At the beginning of this post, I mentioned that you need to remember the name of the IdP you created in your AWS account, and now is when you will use your IdP’s name. Replace <span style="font-family: courier">myADFS</span>, <mark>highlighted</mark> in the following code, with the name of your IdP. (When modifying the rules, be careful not to insert any additional spaces because they can cause claim rules to not work as designed.)</p>

</ol> 
<p>You can now see <span style="font-family: courier">Bob</span>’s email address used in the role session name. If you have enabled CloudTrail, the role session name is captured in CloudTrail and allows you to easily identify who assumed the role. If <span style="font-family: courier">Bob</span> wants to switch to a different account or role, he can return to his AD&nbsp;FS sign-in page (<span style="font-family: courier">https://<span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>Fully.Qualified.Domain.Name.Here</strong></span>/adfs/ls/IdpInitiatedSignOn.aspx</span>) and choose an alternative account or role.</p> 
<h3>Summary</h3> 
<p>In this blog post, I demonstrated how to use dynamic resolution of federated access using AD user attributes to scale your configuration and support a large number&nbsp;of AWS accounts and associated IAM roles. This is a powerful technique for managing a large number of AWS accounts and the federated access of associated AD users. Even though I demonstrate the integration of IAM with AD&nbsp;FS and AD, you can replicate this solution across your choice of SAML federated access technology, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth_(Internet2)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shibboleth</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenLDAP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenLDAP</a>.</p>

<p>Today, the AWS Crypto Tools team introduced a new feature in the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/introduction.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Encryption SDK</a>: <em>data key caching</em>. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/data-key-caching.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data key caching</a> lets you reuse the data keys that protect your data, instead of generating a new data key for each encryption operation.</p> 
<p>Data key caching can reduce latency, improve throughput, reduce cost, and help you stay within service limits as your application scales. In particular, caching might help if your application is hitting the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Key Management Service</a> (KMS) <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/limits.html#requests-per-second" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">requests-per-second limit</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raising the limit</a> does not solve the problem.</p> 
<p>However, these benefits come with some security tradeoffs. Encryption best practices generally discourage extensive reuse of data keys.</p> 
<p>In this blog post, I explore those tradeoffs and provide information that can help you decide whether data key caching is a good strategy for your application. I also explain how data key caching is implemented in the AWS Encryption SDK and describe the security thresholds that you can set to limit the reuse of data keys. Finally, I provide some practical examples of using the security thresholds to meet cost, performance, and security goals.</p> 
<h3><strong>Introducing data key caching</strong></h3> 
<p>The AWS Encryption SDK is a client-side encryption library that makes it easier for you to implement cryptography best practices in your application. It includes secure default behavior for developers who are not encryption experts, while being flexible enough to work for the most experienced users.<span id="more-3955"></span></p> 
<p>In the AWS Encryption SDK, by default, you generate a new data key for each&nbsp;encryption operation. This is the most secure practice. However, in some applications, the overhead of generating a new data key for each operation is not acceptable.</p> 
<p>Data key caching saves the plaintext and ciphertext of the data keys you use in a configurable cache. When you need a key to encrypt or decrypt data, you can reuse a data key from the cache instead of creating a new data key. You can create multiple data key caches and configure each one independently. Most importantly, the AWS Encryption SDK provides <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/thresholds.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">security thresholds</a> that you can set to determine how much data key reuse you will allow.</p> 
<p>To make data key caching easier to implement, the AWS Encryption SDK provides <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/data-key-caching.html#simplecache" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LocalCryptoMaterialsCache</a>, an in-memory, least-recently-used&nbsp;cache with a configurable size. The SDK manages the cache for you, including adding store, search, and match logic to all encryption and decryption operations.</p> 
<p>We recommend that you use LocalCryptoMaterialsCache as it is, but you can customize it, or substitute a compatible cache. However, you should never store plaintext data keys on disk.</p> 
<p>The AWS Encryption SDK documentation includes <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/sample-cache-example.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sample code</a> in Java and Python for an application that uses data key caching to encrypt data sent to and from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/streams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Kinesis Streams</a>.</p> 
<h3><strong>Balance cost and security</strong></h3> 
<p>Your decision to use data key caching should balance cost—in time, money, and resources—against security. In every consideration, though, the balance should favor your security requirements. As a rule, use the minimal caching required to achieve your cost and performance goals.</p> 
<p>Before implementing data key caching, consider the details of your applications, your security requirements, and the cost and frequency of your encryption operations. In general, your application can benefit from data key caching if each operation is slow or expensive, or if you encrypt and decrypt data frequently. If the cost and speed of your encryption operations are already acceptable or can be improved by other means, do not use a data key cache.</p> 
<p>Data key caching can be the right choice for your application if you have high encryption and decryption traffic. For example, if you are hitting your KMS&nbsp;requests-per-second limit, caching can help because you get some of your data keys from the cache instead of calling KMS for every request.</p> 
<p>However, you can also create a case in the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Support Center</a> to raise the KMS limit for your account.&nbsp;If raising the limit solves the problem, you do not need data key caching.</p> 
<h3><strong>Configure caching thresholds for cost and security</strong></h3> 
<p>In the AWS Encryption SDK, you can configure data key caching to allow just enough data key reuse to meet your cost and performance targets while conforming&nbsp;to the security requirements of your application. The SDK enforces the thresholds&nbsp;so that you can use them with any compatible cache.</p> 
<p>The data key caching security thresholds apply to each cache entry. The AWS Encryption SDK will not use the data key from a cache entry that exceeds any of the thresholds that you set.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Maximum age </strong>(required): Set the lifetime of each cached key to be long enough to get cache hits, but short enough to limit exposure of a plaintext data key in memory to a specific time period.</li> 
</ul> 
<p style="padding-left: 30px">You can use the maximum age threshold like a key rotation policy. Use it to limit the reuse of data keys and minimize exposure of cryptographic materials. You can also use it to evict data keys when the type or source of data that your application is processing changes.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Maximum messages encrypted</strong> (optional; default is 2<sup>32</sup> messages): Set the number of messages protected by each cached data key to be large enough to get value from reuse, but small enough to limit the number of messages that might potentially be exposed.</li> 
</ul> 
<p style="padding-left: 30px">The AWS Encryption SDK only caches data keys that use an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/supported-algorithms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">algorithm suite</a> with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">key derivation function</a>. This technique avoids the cryptographic limits on the number of bytes encrypted with a single key. However, the more data that a key encrypts, the more data that is exposed if the data key is compromised.</p> 
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Limiting the number of messages, rather than the number of bytes, is particularly useful if your application encrypts many messages of a similar size or when potential exposure must be limited to very few messages. This threshold is also useful when you want to reuse a data key for a particular type of message and know in advance how many messages of that type you have. You can also use an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/data-key-caching.html#caching-encryption-context" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">encryption context</a> to select particular cached data keys for your encryption requests.</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Maximum bytes encrypted</strong> (optional; default is 2<sup>63</sup> – 1): Set the bytes protected by each cached data key to be large enough to allow the reuse you need, but small enough to limit the amount of data encrypted under the same key.</li> 
</ul> 
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Limiting the number of bytes, rather than the number of messages, is preferable when your application encrypts messages of widely varying size or when possibly exposing large amounts of data is much more of a concern than exposing smaller amounts of data.</p> 
<p>In addition to these security thresholds, the LocalCryptoMaterialsCache in the AWS Encryption SDK lets you set its <em>capacity</em>, which is the maximum number of entries the cache can hold.</p> 
<p>Use the capacity value to tune the performance of your LocalCryptoMaterialsCache. In general, use the smallest value that will achieve the performance improvements that your application requires. You might want to test with a very small cache of 5–10 entries and expand if necessary. You will need a slightly larger cache if you are using the cache for both encryption and decryption requests, or if you are using encryption contexts to select particular cache entries.</p> 
<h3><strong>Consider these cache configuration examples</strong></h3> 
<p>After you determine the security and performance requirements of your application, consider the cache security thresholds carefully and adjust them to meet your needs. There are no magic numbers for these thresholds: the ideal settings are specific to each application, its security and performance requirements, and budget. Use the minimal amount of caching necessary to get acceptable performance and cost.</p> 
<p>The following examples show ways you can use the LocalCryptoMaterialsCache capacity setting and the security thresholds to help meet your security requirements:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Slow master key operations: </strong>If your master key processes only 100 transactions per second (TPS) but your application needs to process 1,000 TPS, you can meet your application requirements by allowing a maximum of 10 messages to be protected under each data key.</li> 
<li><strong>High frequency and volume:</strong> If your master key costs $0.01 per operation and you need to process a consistent 1,000 TPS while staying within a budget of $100,000 per month, allow a maximum of 275 messages for each cache entry.</li> 
<li><strong>Burst traffic: </strong>If your application’s processing bursts to 100 TPS for five seconds in each minute but is otherwise zero, and your master key costs $0.01 per operation, setting maximum messages to 3 can achieve significant savings. To prevent data keys from being reused across bursts (55 seconds), set the maximum age of each cached data key to 20 seconds.</li> 
<li><strong>Expensive master key operations:</strong> If your application uses a low-throughput encryption service that costs as much as $1.00 per operation, you might want to minimize the number of operations. To do so, create a cache that is large enough to contain the data keys you need. Then, set the byte and message limits high enough to allow reuse while conforming to your security requirements. For example, if your security requirements do not permit a data key to encrypt more than 10 GB of data, setting bytes processed to 10 GB still significantly minimizes operations and conforms to your security requirements.</li> 
</ul>

<p>To help Financial Services clients address Singapore’s regulations on financial institutions in a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared responsibility environment</a>, AWS has published the&nbsp;<a href="https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/Financial_Services_Regulations_Guidelines_in_Singapore.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS User Guide to Financial Services Regulations and Guidelines in Singapore</a>. This first-ever AWS Financial Services guide is the culmination of the work AWS has done in the last year to help customers navigate the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s 2016 updated guidelines about cloud services.</p> 
<p>This new guide examines Singaporean requirements and guidelines, providing information that will help you conduct due diligence on AWS with regard to IT security and risk management. The guide also shares leading practices to empower you to develop your own governance programs by using AWS.</p> 
<p>The guide focuses on three top considerations for financial institutions operating in Singapore:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Outsourcing guidelines</strong> – Conduct a self-assessment of AWS services and align your governance requirements within a shared responsibility model.</li> 
<li><strong>Technology risk management</strong> – Take a deeper look at where shared responsibility exists for technology implementation and perform a self-assessment of AWS service responsibilities.</li> 
<li><strong>Cloud computing implementation</strong> – Assess additional responsibilities to ensure security and compliance with local guidelines.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>We will release additional AWS Financial Services resource guides this year to help you understand the requirements in other markets around the globe. These guides will be posted on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Compliance Resources</a> page.</p> 
<p>If you have questions or comments about this new guide, submit them in the “Comments” section below.</p>

<p>AWS has the longest running, most effective, and most customer-obsessed compliance program in the cloud market. We have always centered our program around customers, obtaining the certifications needed to provide our customers with the proper level of validated transparency in order to enable them to certify their own AWS workloads [<a href="https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_Certifications_Programs_Reports_Third-Party_Attestations.pdf">download .pdf of AWS certifications</a>]. We also offer a rich suite of embedded compliance tooling, enabling customers and partners to more effectively manage security controls and in turn provide evidence of effective control operation to their auditors. Along with our customers and partners, we have the largest, most diverse, and most comprehensive compliance footprint in the industry.</p> 
<p>Enabling customers is a core part of the AWS DNA. Today, in the spirit of that pedigree, I’m happy to announce we’ve launched a new<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/customer-center/"> AWS Customer Compliance Center</a>. This center is focused on the security and compliance of our customers on AWS. You can learn from other customer experiences and discover how your peers have solved the compliance, governance, and audit challenges present in today’s regulatory environment. You can also access our industry-first <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/auditor-learning-path/">cloud Auditor Learning Path</a> via the&nbsp;customer center. These online university learning resources are logical learning paths, specifically designed for security, compliance and audit professionals, allowing you to build on the IT skills you have to move your environment to the next generation of audit and security assurance. As we engage with our security and compliance customer colleagues on this topic, we will continue to update and improve upon the existing resource and publish new enablers in the coming months.</p> 
<p>We are excited to continue to work with our customers on moving from the old-guard manual audit world to the new cloud-enabled, automated, “secure and compliant by default” model we’ve been leading over the past few years.</p>
