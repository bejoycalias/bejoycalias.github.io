<p><em>This post courtesy of Shane Baldacchino, Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services.</em></p> 
<p>Many customers ask for guidance on migrating end-to-end solutions running on virtual machines over to AWS. This post provides an overview of moving a common WordPress blog running on a virtualized platform to AWS, including re-pointing the DNS records associated to with the website.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/server-migration-service">AWS Server Migration Service</a> (AWS SMS) is an agentless service that makes it easier and faster for you to migrate thousands of on-premises workloads to AWS. AWS SMS allows you to automate, schedule, and track incremental replications of live server volumes, making it easier for you to coordinate large-scale server migrations.</p> 
<b>Walkthrough</b> 
<p>The key elements of this migration process include the following steps:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Establish your AWS environment.</li> 
<li>Replicate your database.</li> 
<li>Download the SMS Connector from the AWS Management Console.</li> 
<li>Configure AWS SMS and Hypervisor permissions.</li> 
<li>Install and configure the SMS Connector appliance.</li> 
<li>Import your virtual machine inventory and create a replication job.</li> 
<li>Launch your Amazon EC2 instance.</li> 
<li>Change your DNS records to resolve the WordPress blog to your EC2 instance.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Before you start, ensure that your source systems OS and hypervisor version are supported by AWS. For more information, see the Server Migration Service FAQ.</p> 
<b>Establish your AWS environment</b> 
<p>For this walkthrough, your WordPress blog is currently running as a two-tier LAMP stack in a corporate data center. You have a frontend running Apache and PHP, plus a backend database running on MySQL. All systems are hosted on a virtualized platform.</p> 
<p>First, establish your AWS environment. If your organization is new to AWS, this may include account or subaccount creation, a new virtual private cloud (VPC), and associated subnets, route tables, internet gateways, and so on. Think of this phase as setting up your software-defined data center. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/getting-started/">Getting Started with Amazon EC2</a>.</p> 
<p>The blog is a two-tier stack, so go with two private subnets. Because you want it to be highly available, use multiple <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-regions-availability-zones">Availability Zones</a>. A zone resides within an AWS Region. Each zone is isolated, but the zones within a region are connected through low-latency links. This allows architects and solution designers to build highly available solutions.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/Screen-Shot-2018-01-15-at-10.11.26-PM.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/Screen-Shot-2018-01-15-at-10.11.26-PM-1024x621.png" /></a></p> 
<b>Replicate your database</b> 
<p>WordPress uses a MySQL relational database. You could continue to manage MySQL and the associated EC2 instances associated with maintaining and scaling a database. For this walkthrough, use this opportunity to migrate to an RDS instance of Amazon Aurora, as it is a MySQL compliant database. Not only is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aurora">Amazon Aurora</a> a high-performant database engine but it frees you up to focus on application development by managing time-consuming database administration tasks, including backups, software patching, monitoring, scaling, and replication.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/Screen-Shot-2018-01-15-at-10.12.56-PM.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/Screen-Shot-2018-01-15-at-10.12.56-PM-1024x641.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dms/">AWS Database Migration Service</a>&nbsp;to migrate your MySQL database to Amazon Aurora easily and securely. After a database migration instance has been instantiated, configure the source and destination endpoints and create a replication task.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/dms-console.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/dms-console-1024x327.png" /></a></p> 
<p>By attaching to the MySQL binlog, you can seed in the current data in the database and also capture all future state changes in near real time. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/sbs/CHAP_MySQL2Aurora.html">Migrating a MySQL-Compatible Database to Amazon Aurora</a>.</p> 
<p>Finally, the task shows that you are replicating current data in your WordPress blog database and future changes from MySQL into Amazon Aurora.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/dms-console-actions.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/dms-console-actions-1024x564.png" /></a></p> 
<b>Download the SMS Connector from the AWS Management Console</b> 
<p>Now, use AWS SMS to migrate your Apache PHP frontend to EC2. AWS SMS is delivered as an appliance for your hypervisor.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/Screen-Shot-2018-01-15-at-10.15.54-PM.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/Screen-Shot-2018-01-15-at-10.15.54-PM-1024x635.png" /></a></p> 
<p>To download the SMS Connector, log in to the console and choose Server Migration Service, Connectors, SMS Connector setup guide.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/connector-setup.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/connector-setup-1024x358.png" /></a></p> 
<b>Configure AWS SMS</b> 
<p>Your hypervisor and AWS SMS will need an appropriate user with sufficient privileges to perform migrations.</p> 
<li>AWS SMS – Use the AWS CLI or the IAM console to create an IAM user with the ServerMigrationConnector policy attached.</li> 
<li>Hypervisor – Follow the specific instructions for your hypervisor in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/server-migration-service/latest/userguide/SMS_setup.html">Getting Started with AWS Server Migration Service</a>.</li> 
<b>Install and configure the SMS Connector appliance</b> 
<p>Launch a new VM based on the SMS Connector that you downloaded. To configure the connector, connect to it via HTTPS. You can obtain the SMS Connector IP address from your hypervisor.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/connector-actions.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/connector-actions-1024x333.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Connect to the SMS Connector via HTTPS. In the example above, the connector IP address is 10.0.0.31. In your browser, enter https://10.0.0.31.</p> 
<p>Configure the connector with the IAM and hypervisor credentials that you created earlier.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/connector-connection.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/connector-connection-1024x548.png" /></a></p> 
<p>After it’s configured, and the associated connectivity and authentication checks have passed, return to the console and view your connector in AWS SMS.</p> 
<p>Import your virtual machine inventory and create a replication job<br /> After validating that the SMS Connector is in a “HEALTHY” state, import your server catalog to AWS SMS. This process can take up to a minute.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/connector-healthy.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/connector-healthy-1024x391.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Select the server to migrate and choose Create replication job. The console guides you through the process. The time that the initial replication task takes to complete is dependent on the available bandwidth and the size of your VM. After the initial seed replication, network bandwidth is minimized as AWS SMS replicates only incremental changes occurring on the VM.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/replication-jobs.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/replication-jobs-1024x290.png" /></a></p> 
<b>Launch your EC2 instance</b> 
<p>When your replication task is complete, the artifact created by AWS SMS is a custom AMI that you can use to deploy an EC2 instance. Follow the usual process to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/launching-instance.html">launch your EC2 instance</a>, noting that you may need to replace any host-based firewalls with security groups and NACLs.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/replication-jobs-status.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/replication-jobs-status-1024x485.png" /></a></p> 
<p>When you create an EC2 instance, ensure that you pick the most suitable <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/?sc_channel=PS&amp;sc_campaign=acquisition_AU&amp;sc_publisher=google&amp;sc_medium=ec2_b&amp;sc_content=sitelink&amp;sc_detail=ec2%20instance&amp;sc_category=ec2&amp;sc_segment=instance_types&amp;sc_matchtype=p&amp;sc_country=AU&amp;s_kwcid=AL!">EC2 instance type</a> and size to match your performance requirements while optimizing for cost.</p> 
<p>While your new EC2 instance is a replica of your on-premises VM, you should always validate that applications are functioning. How you do this differs on an application-by-application basis. You can use a combination of approaches, such as editing a local host file and testing your application, SSH, or Telnet.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/ssh-screenshot.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/ssh-screenshot.png" /></a></p> 
<p>From the RDS console, get your connection string details and update your WordPress configuration file to point to the Amazon Aurora database. As WordPress is expecting a MySQL database and Amazon Aurora is MySQL-compliant, this change of database engine is transparent to WordPress.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/wp-config.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/wp-config.png" /></a></p> 
<b>Change your DNS records to resolve the WordPress blog to your EC2 instance</b> 
<p>You have validated that your WordPress application is running correctly, as you are still receiving changes from your on-premises data center via AWS DMS into your Amazon Aurora database.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/Screen-Shot-2018-01-15-at-10.24.11-PM.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/Screen-Shot-2018-01-15-at-10.24.11-PM-1024x607.png" /></a></p> 
<p>You can now update your DNS zone file using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53">Amazon Route 53</a>. Route 53 can be driven by multiple methods: console, SDK, or AWS CLI.</p> 
<p>For this walkthrough, update your DNS zone file via the AWS CLI. The JSON example shows upserting the A record in your zone to resolve to your EC2 instance.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/json-dns.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/json-dns.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Use the AWS CLI to execute the request and update the record in your zone file.&nbsp; The cut-over period between the original off-cloud location and AWS is defined by the TTL in the SOA (statement of authority) in your DNS zone. During this period, any requests resolving to your off-cloud server that result in database writes are automatically replicated to your Amazon Aurora instance via AWS DMS.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/route53-cli.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/route53-cli-1024x331.png" /></a></p> 
<p>You have now successfully migrated your WordPress blog to AWS. Based on the TTL of your DNS zone file, end users slowly resolve the WordPress blog to AWS.</p> 
<p>After you have validated your successful migration, be sure to delete your AWS DMS task and your AWS SMS replication job.</p> 
<b>Summary</b> 
<p>In this post, you moved a WordPress blog to AWS, using AWS SMS and AWS DMS to re-point the associated DNS records.</p> 
<p>Many architectures can be extended to use many of the inherent benefits of AWS, with little effort. For example, by using Amazon CloudWatch metrics to drive Auto Scaling policies, you can use an Application Load Balancer as your frontend. This removes the single point of failure for a single Amazon EC2 instance and ensures that your deployed capacity closely follows customer demand. Think big and get building!</p>

<p><em>This post courtesy of Paul Maddox, Specialist Solutions Architect (Developer Technologies).</em></p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/01/aws-lambda-supports-go/">Today</a>, we’re excited to announce <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> as a supported language for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda">AWS Lambda</a>.</p> 
<p>As someone who’s done their fair share of Go development (recent projects include <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-local">AWS SAM Local</a> and <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/goformation">GoFormation</a>), this is a release I’ve been looking forward to for a while. I’m going to take this opportunity to walk you through how it works by creating a Go serverless application, and deploying it to Lambda.</p> 
<h3>Prerequisites</h3> 
<p>This post assumes that you already have Go installed and configured on your development machine, as well as a basic understanding of Go development concepts. For more details, see&nbsp;<a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">https://golang.org/doc/install</a>.</p> 
<b>Creating an example Serverless application with Go</b> 
<p>Lambda functions can be triggered by variety of event sources:</p> 
<li>Asynchronous events (such as an object being put in an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a> bucket)</li> 
<li>Streaming events (for example, new data records on an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis">Amazon Kinesis</a> stream)</li> 
<li>Synchronous events (manual invocation, or HTTPS request via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/apigateway">Amazon API Gateway</a>)</li> 
<p>As an example, you’re going to create an application that uses an API Gateway event source to create a simple Hello World RESTful API.&nbsp;The full source code for this example application can be found on GitHub at:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/lambda-go-samples">https://github.com/aws-samples/lambda-go-samples</a>.</p> 
<p>After the application is published, it receives a name via the HTTPS request body, and responds with&nbsp;“Hello &lt;name&gt;.” For example:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">$ curl -XPOST -d &quot;Paul&quot;&nbsp;&quot;https://my-awesome-api.example.com/&quot;
Hello&nbsp;Paul</code> 
<p>To implement this, create a Lambda handler function in Go.</p> 
<p>Import the <a href="http://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go">github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go</a>&nbsp;package, which includes helpful Go definitions for Lambda event sources, as well as the <strong>lambda.Start()</strong> method used to register your handler function.</p> 
<p>Start by creating a new project directory in your <strong>$GOPATH</strong>, and then creating a <strong>main.go</strong> file that contains your Lambda handler function:</p> 
<code class="lang-go">package main
import (
&quot;errors&quot;
&quot;log&quot;
&quot;github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/events&quot;
&quot;github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda&quot;
)
var (
// ErrNameNotProvided is thrown when a name is not provided
ErrNameNotProvided = errors.New(&quot;no name was provided in the HTTP body&quot;)
)
// Handler is your Lambda function handler
// It uses Amazon API Gateway request/responses provided by the aws-lambda-go/events package,
// However you could use other event sources (S3, Kinesis etc), or JSON-decoded primitive types such as 'string'.
func Handler(request events.APIGatewayProxyRequest) (events.APIGatewayProxyResponse, error) {
// stdout and stderr are sent to AWS CloudWatch Logs
log.Printf(&quot;Processing Lambda request %s\n&quot;, request.RequestContext.RequestID)
// If no name is provided in the HTTP request body, throw an error
if len(request.Body) &lt; 1 {
return events.APIGatewayProxyResponse{}, ErrNameNotProvided
}
return events.APIGatewayProxyResponse{
Body: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Hello &quot; + request.Body,
StatusCode: 200,
}, nil
}
func main() {
lambda.Start(Handler)
}
</code> 
<p>The <strong>lambda.Start()</strong> method takes a handler, and talks to an internal Lambda endpoint to pass Invoke requests to the handler. If a&nbsp;handler does not match one of the supported types, the Lambda package responds to new invocations served by an&nbsp;internal endpoint with an error message such as:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">json: cannot unmarshal object into Go value of type int32: UnmarshalTypeError</code> 
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>lambda.Start()</strong>&nbsp;method blocks, and does not return after being called, meaning that it’s suitable to run in your Go application’s main entry point.</p> 
<b>More detail on AWS Lambda function handlers with Go</b> 
<p>A handler function passed to <strong>lambda.Start()</strong> must follow these rules:</p> 
<li>It must be a function.</li> 
<li>The function may take between 0 and 2 arguments. 
<li>If there are two arguments, the first argument must implement <strong>context.Context</strong>.</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li>The function may return between 0 and 2 values. 
<li>If there is one return value, it must implement&nbsp;<strong>error</strong>.</li> 
<li>If there are two return values, the second value must implement&nbsp;<strong>error</strong>.</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<p>The <a href="http://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go">github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go</a>&nbsp;library automatically unmarshals the Lambda event JSON to the argument type used by your handler function. To do this, it uses Go’s standard <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Unmarshal">encoding/json</a>&nbsp;package, so your handler function can use any of the standard types supported for unmarshalling (or custom types containing those):</p> 
<li>bool, for JSON booleans</li> 
<li>float64, for JSON numbers</li> 
<li>string, for JSON strings</li> 
<li>[]interface{}, for JSON arrays</li> 
<li>map[string]interface{}, for JSON objects</li> 
<li>nil, for JSON null</li> 
<p>For example, your Lambda function received a JSON event payload like the following:</p> 
<code class="lang-json">{
&quot;id&quot;:&nbsp;12345,
&quot;value&quot;:&nbsp;&quot;some-value&quot;
}</code> 
<p>It should respond with a JSON response that looks like the following:</p> 
<code class="lang-json">{
&quot;message&quot;:&nbsp;&quot;processed request ID 12345&quot;,
&quot;ok&quot;:&nbsp;true
}</code> 
<p>You could use a Lambda handler function that looks like the following:</p> 
<code class="lang-go">package&nbsp;main
import&nbsp;(
&quot;fmt&quot;
&quot;github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda&quot;
)
type Request struct {
ID &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;float64 `json:&quot;id&quot;`
Value &nbsp; &nbsp; string &nbsp;`json:&quot;value&quot;`
}
type Response struct {
Message string `json:&quot;message&quot;`
Ok &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bool &nbsp; `json:&quot;ok&quot;`
}
func Handler(request Request) (Response, error) {
return Response{
Message: fmt.Sprintf(&quot;Processed request ID %f&quot;, request.ID),
Ok: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;true,
}, nil
}
func main() {
lambda.Start(Handler)
}</code> 
<p>For convenience, the <a href="http://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go">github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go</a>&nbsp;package provides event sources that you can also use in your handler function arguments. It also provides return values for common sources such as S3, Kinesis, Cognito, and the API Gateway event source and response objects that you’re using in the application example.</p> 
<b>Adding unit tests</b> 
<p>To test that the Lambda handler works as expected, create a main_test.go file containing some basic unit tests.</p> 
<code class="lang-go">package main_test
import (
&quot;testing&quot;
main &quot;github.com/aws-samples/lambda-go-samples&quot;
&quot;github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/events&quot;
&quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/assert&quot;
)
func TestHandler(t *testing.T) {
tests := []struct {
request events.APIGatewayProxyRequest
expect &nbsp;string
err &nbsp; &nbsp; error
}{
{
// Test that the handler responds with the correct response
// when a valid name is provided in the HTTP body
request: events.APIGatewayProxyRequest{Body: &quot;Paul&quot;},
expect: &nbsp;&quot;Hello Paul&quot;,
err: &nbsp; &nbsp; nil,
},
{
// Test that the handler responds ErrNameNotProvided
// when no name is provided in the HTTP body
request: events.APIGatewayProxyRequest{Body: &quot;&quot;},
expect: &nbsp;&quot;&quot;,
err: &nbsp; &nbsp; main.ErrNameNotProvided,
},
}
for _, test := range tests {
response, err := main.Handler(test.request) 
assert.IsType(t, test.err, err)
assert.Equal(t, test.expect, response.Body)
}
}
</code> 
<h3>Run your tests:</h3> 
<code class="lang-base">$ go test
PASS
ok &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;github.com/awslabs/lambda-go-example &nbsp; &nbsp;0.041s</code> 
<p><em>Note:&nbsp;To make the unit tests more readable, this example uses a third-party library (https://github.com/stretchr/testify). This allows you to describe the test cases in a more natural format, making them more maintainable for other people who may be working in the code base.</em></p> 
<b>Build and deploy</b> 
<p>As Go is a compiled language, build the application and create a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-go-how-to-create-deployment-package.html">Lambda deployment package</a>. To do this, build a binary that runs on Linux, and zip it up into a deployment package.</p> 
<p>To do this, we need to build a binary that will run on Linux, and ZIP it up into a deployment package.</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">$ GOOS=linux go build -o main
$ zip deployment.zip main</code> 
<p>The binary doesn’t need to be called main, but the name must match the Handler configuration property of the deployed Lambda function.</p> 
<p>The deployment package is now ready to be deployed to Lambda.&nbsp;One deployment method is to use the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS CLI</a>. Provide a valid <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html#lambda-intro-execution-role">Lambda execution role</a> for&nbsp; <strong>–role</strong>.</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">$&nbsp;aws lambda create-function \
--region us-west-1 \
--function-name HelloFunction&nbsp;\
--zip-file fileb://./deployment.zip \
--runtime go1.x \
--tracing-config Mode=Active \
--role arn:aws:iam::&lt;account-id&gt;:role/&lt;role&gt;&nbsp;\
--handler main</code> 
<p>From here, configure the invoking service for your function, in this example API Gateway, to call this function and provide the HTTPS frontend for your API. For more information about how to do this in the API Gateway console, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-api-as-simple-proxy-for-lambda.html#api-gateway-create-api-as-simple-proxy-for-lambda-build">Create an API with Lambda Proxy Integration</a>. You could also do this in the Lambda console by assigning an API Gateway trigger.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/lambda-console1.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/lambda-console1.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Then, configure the trigger:</p> 
<li><strong>API name</strong>: lambda-go</li> 
<li><strong>Deployment stage</strong>: prod</li> 
<li><strong>Security</strong>: open</li> 
<p>This results in an API Gateway endpoint that you can test.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/lambda-console-gateway.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/lambda-console-gateway.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Now, you can use cURL to test your API:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">$ curl -XPOST -d &quot;Paul&quot;&nbsp;https://u7fe6p3v64.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/main
Hello&nbsp;Paul</code> 
<p>Doing this manually is fine and works for testing and exploration. If you were doing this for real, you’d want to automate this process further. The next section shows how to add a CI/CD pipeline to this process to build, test, and deploy your serverless application as you change your code.</p> 
<b>Automating tests and deployments</b> 
<p>Next, configure <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline">AWS CodePipeline</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild">AWS CodeBuild</a> to build your application automatically and run all of the tests. If it passes, deploy your application to Lambda.</p> 
<p>The first thing you need to do is create an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/11/introducing-the-aws-serverless-application-model/">AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)</a> template in your source repository. SAM provides an easy way to deploy Serverless resources, such as Lambda functions, APIs, and other event sources, as well as all of the necessary IAM permissions, etc. You can also include any valid <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation">AWS CloudFormation</a> resources within your SAM template, such as a Kinesis stream, or an&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb">Amazon DynamoDB</a> table. They are deployed alongside your Serverless application.</p> 
<p>Create a file called <strong>template.yml</strong> in your application repository with the following contents:</p> 
<code class="lang-yaml">AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
Resources:
HelloFunction:
Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
Properties:
Handler:&nbsp;main
Runtime: go1.x
Tracing: Active
Events:
GetEvent:
Type: Api
Properties:
Path: /
Method: post</code> 
<p>The above template instructs SAM to deploy a Lambda function (called <strong>HelloFunction</strong> in this case), with the Go runtime (<strong>go1.x</strong>), and also an API configured to pass HTTP POST requests to your Lambda function. The Handler property defines which binary in the deployment package needs to be executed (<strong>main</strong> in this case).</p> 
<p>You’re going to use CodeBuild to run your tests, build your Go application, and package it. You can tell CodeBuild how to do all of this by creating a <strong>buildspec.yml</strong> file in your repository containing the following:</p> 
<code class="lang-yaml">
version: 0.2
env:
variables:
# This S3 bucket is used to store the packaged Lambda deployment bundle.
# Make sure to provide a valid S3 bucket name (it must exist already).
# The CodeBuild IAM role must allow write access to it.
S3_BUCKET: &quot;your-s3-bucket&quot;
PACKAGE: &quot;github.com/aws-samples/lambda-go-samples&quot;
phases:
install:
commands:
# AWS Codebuild Go images use /go for the $GOPATH so copy the
# application source code into that directory structure.
- mkdir -p &quot;/go/src/$(dirname ${PACKAGE})&quot;
- ln -s &quot;${CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR}&quot; &quot;/go/src/${PACKAGE}&quot;
# Print all environment variables (handy for AWS CodeBuild logs)
- env
# Install golint
- go get -u github.com/golang/lint/golint
pre_build:
commands:
# Make sure we're in the project directory within our GOPATH
- cd &quot;/go/src/${PACKAGE}&quot;
# Fetch all dependencies
- go get -t ./...
# Ensure that the code passes all lint tests
- golint -set_exit_status
# Check for common Go problems with 'go vet'
-&nbsp;go vet .
# Run all tests included with the application
- go test .
build:
commands:
# Build the go application
- go build -o main
# Package the application with AWS SAM
- aws cloudformation package --template-file template.yml --s3-bucket ${S3_BUCKET} --output-template-file packaged.yml
artifacts:
files:
- packaged.yml</code> 
<p>This buildspec file does the following:</p> 
<li>Sets up your GOPATH, ready for building</li> 
<li>Runs <a href="https://github.com/golang/lint">golint</a>&nbsp;to make sure that any committed code matches the Go style and formatting specification</li> 
<li>Runs any unit tests present (via <strong>go test</strong>)</li> 
<li>Builds your application binary</li> 
<li>Packages the binary into a&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-go-how-to-create-deployment-package.html">Lambda deployment package</a>&nbsp;and uploads it to S3</li> 
<p>For more details about buildspec files, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html">Build Specification Reference</a> for AWS CodeBuild.</p> 
<p>Your project directory should now contain the following files:</p> 
<code>$ tree
.
├── buildspec.yml &nbsp; &nbsp;(AWS CodeBuild&nbsp;configuration file)
├── main.go &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Our&nbsp;application)
├── main_test.go&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(Unit&nbsp;tests)
└── template.yml &nbsp; &nbsp; (AWS SAM template)
0 directories, 4 files</code> 
<p>You’re now ready to set up your automated pipeline with CodePipeline.</p> 
<h3>Create a new pipeline</h3> 
<p>Get started by navigating to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/">CodePipeline</a> console. You need to give your new pipeline a name, such as HelloService.</p> 
<p>Next, select the source repository in which your application code is located. CodePipeline supports either AWS CodeCommit, GitHub.com, or S3. To use the example GitHub.com repository mentioned earlier in this post, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">fork</a> it into your own GitHub.com account or create a new CodeCommit repository and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/how-to-migrate-repository-existing.html">clone</a> it into there. Do this first before selecting a source location.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline1.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline1.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Tell CodePipeline to use CodeBuild to test, build, and package your application using the buildspec.yml file created earlier:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline-build.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline-build.png" /></a></p> 
<p><strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp;CodeBuild needs read/write access to the S3 bucket referenced in the buildspec.yml file that you wrote. It places the packaged Lambda deployment package into S3 after the tests and build are completed. Make sure that the CodeBuild service role created or provided has the correct IAM permissions. For more information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/writing-iam-policies-how-to-grant-access-to-an-amazon-s3-bucket/">Writing IAM Policies: How to grant access to an Amazon S3 bucket</a>. If you don’t do this, CodeBuild fails.</p> 
<p>Finally, set up the deployment stage of your pipeline. Select <strong>AWS CloudFormation</strong> as the deployment method, and the <strong>Create or replace a change set</strong>&nbsp;mode (as required by SAM). To deploy multiple environments (for example, staging, production), add additional deployment stages to your pipeline after it has been created.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline-deploy.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline-deploy.png" /></a></p> 
<p>After being created, your pipeline takes a few minutes to initialize, and then automatically triggers.&nbsp;You can see the latest commit in your version control system make progress through the build and deploy stages of your pipeline.</p> 
<p>You do not need to configure anything further to automatically run your pipeline on new version control commits. It already automatically triggers, builds, and deploys each time.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline-created.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline-created.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Make one final change to the pipeline, to configure the deployment stage to execute the CloudFormation changeset that it creates. To make this change, choose the <strong>Edit</strong> button on your pipeline, choose the pencil icon on the staging deployment stage, and add a new action:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline-addaction.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline-addaction.png" /></a></p> 
<p>After the action is added, save your pipeline. You can test it by making a small change to your Lambda function, and then committing it back to version control. You can see your pipeline trigger, and the changes get deployed to your staging environment.</p> 
<h3>See it in Action</h3> 
<p>After a successful run of the pipeline has completed, you can navigate to the CloudFormation console to see the deployment details.</p> 
<p>In your case, you have a CloudFormation stack deployed. If you look at the <strong>Resources</strong> tab, you see a table of the AWS resources that have been deployed.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/cloudformation-resources.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/cloudformation-resources.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Choose the <strong>ServerlessRestApi</strong> item link to navigate to the API Gateway console and view the details of your deployed API, including the URL,</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/api-gw-stage-edit.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/api-gw-stage-edit.png" /></a></p> 
<p>You can use cURL to test that your Serverless application is functioning as expected:</p> 
<code>$ curl -XPOST -d &quot;Paul&quot;&nbsp;https://y5fjgtq6dj.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Stage
Hello&nbsp;Paul</code> 
<b>One more thing!</b> 
<p>We are also excited to announce that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/xray/">AWS X-Ray</a>&nbsp;can be enabled in your Lambda runtime to analyze and debug your Go functions written for Lambda. The&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-sdk-go.html">X-Ray SDK for Go</a>&nbsp;works with the Go context of your Lambda function, providing features such as&nbsp;AWS SDK retry visibility&nbsp;and one-line error capture.<br /> <a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/xray-go.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/xray-go.png">annotations and metadata</a>&nbsp;to capture additional information in X-Ray about your function invocations. Moreover, the SDK supports the net/http client package, enabling you to trace requests made to&nbsp;endpoints even if they are not X-Ray enabled.</p> 
<b>Wrapping it up!</b> 
<p>Support for Go has been a much-requested feature in Lambda and we are excited to be able to bring it to you. In this post, you created a basic Go-based API and then went on to create a full continuous integration and delivery pipeline that tests, builds, and deploys your application each time you make a change.</p> 
<p>You can also get started with AWS Lambda Go support through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codestar">AWS CodeStar</a>. AWS CodeStar lets you quickly launch development projects that include a sample application, source control and release automation. With this announcement, AWS CodeStar introduced new project templates for Go running on AWS Lambda.

<p><em>This post contributed by&nbsp;Abby Fuller</em>,&nbsp;<em>AWS Senior Technical Evangelist</em></p> 
<p>Last week, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/12/aws-codepipeline-adds-support-for-amazon-ecs-and-aws-fargate/">AWS announced support</a> for Amazon Elastic Container Service (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs">ECS</a>) targets (including <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate">AWS Fargate</a>) in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline">AWS CodePipeline</a>. This support makes it easier to create a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-delivery/">continuous delivery</a> pipeline for container-based applications and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/microservices">microservices</a>.</p> 
<p>Building and deploying containerized services&nbsp;manually is slow and prone to errors. Continuous delivery with automated build and test mechanisms helps detect errors early, saves time, and reduces failures, making this a popular model for application deployments. Previously, to automate your container workflows with ECS, you had to build your own solution using AWS CloudFormation. Now, you can integrate CodePipeline and CodeBuild with ECS to automate your workflows in just a few steps.</p> 
<p>A typical continuous delivery workflow with CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and ECS might look something like the following:</p> 
<li>Choosing your source</li> 
<li>Building your project</li> 
<li>Deploying your code</li> 
<p>We also have a continuous deployment reference architecture on <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/ecs-refarch-continuous-deployment">GitHub</a>&nbsp;for this workflow.</p> 
<b>Getting Started</b> 
<p>First, create a new project with CodePipeline and give the project a name, such as “demo”.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/22/1_name_codepipeline-1024x447.png" /></p> 
<p>Next, choose a source location where the code is stored. This could be AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, or Amazon S3. For this example, enter <strong>GitHub</strong> and then give CodePipeline access to the repository.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/22/2_add_source_location_codepipeline-1024x686.png" /></p> 
<p>Next, add a build step. You can import an existing build, such as a Jenkins server URL or CodeBuild project, or create a new step with CodeBuild. If you don’t have an existing build project in CodeBuild, create one from within CodePipeline:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/22/3_provider_codebuild-766x1024.png" /></p> 
<li><strong>Build provider</strong>: AWS CodeBuild</li> 
<li><strong>Configure your project</strong>: Create a new build project</li> 
<li><strong>Environment image</strong>: Use an image managed by AWS CodeBuild</li> 
<li><strong>Operating system</strong>: Ubuntu</li> 
<li><strong>Runtime</strong>: Docker</li> 
<li><strong>Version</strong>: aws/codebuild/docker:1.12.1</li> 
<li><strong>Build specification</strong>: Use the buildspec.yml in the source code root directory</li> 
<p>Now that you’ve created the CodeBuild step, you can use it as an existing project in CodePipeline.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/22/4_add_codebuild_codepipeline-1024x713.png" /></p> 
<p>Next, add a deployment provider. This is where your built code is placed. It can be a number of different options, such as AWS CodeDeploy, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS CloudFormation, or Amazon ECS. For this example, connect to Amazon ECS.</p> 
<p>For CodeBuild to deploy to ECS, you must create an image definition JSON file. This requires adding some instructions to the pre-build, build, and post-build phases of the CodeBuild build process in your <em>buildspec.yml</em> file. For help with creating the image definition file, see Step 1 of the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-cd-pipeline.html">Tutorial: Continuous Deployment with AWS CodePipeline</a>.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/22/5_add_deploy_step_codepipeline-1024x914.png" /></p> 
<li><strong>Deployment provider</strong>: Amazon ECS</li> 
<li><strong>Cluster name</strong>: enter your project name from the build step</li> 
<li><strong>Service name</strong>: web</li> 
<li><strong>Image filename</strong>: enter your image definition filename (“web.json”).</li> 
<p>You are almost done!</p> 
<p>You can now choose an existing IAM service role that CodePipeline can use to access resources in your account, or let CodePipeline create one. For this example, use the wizard, and go with the role that it creates (<code class="lang-bash">AWS-CodePipeline-Service</code>).</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/22/6_add_role_codepipeline-1024x451.png" /></p> 
<p>Finally, review all of your changes, and choose <strong>Create pipeline</strong>.</p> 
<p>After the pipeline is created, you’ll have a model of your entire pipeline where you can view your executions, add different tests, add manual approvals, or release a change.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/22/7_review_changes_codepipeline-1024x564.png" /></p>

<p>At re:Invent 2014, we announced AWS Lambda, what is now the center of the serverless platform at AWS, and helped ignite the trend of companies building serverless applications.</p> 
<p>This year, at re:Invent 2017, the topic of serverless was everywhere. We were incredibly excited to see the energy from everyone attending&nbsp;7 workshops, 15 chalk talks, 20 skills sessions and 27 breakout sessions. Many of these sessions were repeated due to high demand, so we are happy to summarize and provide links to the recordings and slides of these sessions.</p> 
<p>Over the course of the week leading up to and then the week of re:Invent, we also had over 15 new features and capabilities across a number of serverless services, including AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda@Edge, AWS SAM, and the newly announced AWS Serverless Application Repository!</p> 
<b>AWS Lambda</b> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/aws-lambda-doubles-maximum-memory-capacity-for-lambda-functions/">AWS Lambda Doubles Maximum Memory Capacity for Lambda Functions</a> – We’ve doubled the maximum memory that you can configure a function to have available, to 3 GB. With this, comes proportional increases to CPU and networking so that your function gets access to two CPU cores!</li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/aws-lambda-supports-traffic-shifting-and-phased-deployments-with-aws-codedeploy/">AWS Lambda Supports Traffic Shifting and Phased Deployments with AWS CodeDeploy</a> – Traffic shifting allows you to deploy your Lambda functions using standard industry best practices such as canaries and blue/green deployments. With CodeDeploy, you get the ability to automate rollbacks and have events fired off by triggers set around the lifecycle of an individual deployment. 
<li>Blog Post: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/implementing-canary-deployments-of-aws-lambda-functions-with-alias-traffic-shifting/">Implementing Canary Deployments of AWS Lambda Functions with Alias Traffic Shifting</a></li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/aws-lambda-introduces-enhanced-console-experience/">AWS Lambda Introduces Enhanced Console Experience</a> – We’ve reworked so many parts of the console that it’s hard to cover it in a single post. Go and check it out for yourself!</li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/set-concurrency-limits-on-individual-aws-lambda-functions/">Set Concurrency Limits on Individual AWS Lambda Functions</a> – You can now set a concurrency reservation for a function in your account allowing you to limit functions from using too many backend resources or taking up too much concurrency, or to control costs. 
<li>Blog Post:&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/managing-aws-lambda-function-concurrency/">Managing AWS Lambda Function Concurrency</a></li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/aws-cloudtrail-adds-logging-of-execution-activity-for-aws-lambda-functions/">AWS CloudTrail Adds Logging of Execution Activity for AWS Lambda Functions </a>– Gain a better understanding of who or what is invoking your Lambda functions via CloudTrail Data Events for Lambda.<br /> Pre-announcement: Golang and .NET Core 2.0 support coming soon!</li> 
<b>Amazon API Gateway</b> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/amazon-api-gateway-supports-endpoint-integrations-with-private-vpcs/">Amazon API Gateway Supports Endpoint Integrations with Private VPCs</a> – You can now provide access to HTTP(S) resources within your VPC without exposing them directly to the public internet. This includes resources available over a VPN or Direct Connect connection!</li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/amazon-api-gateway-supports-canary-release-deployments/">Amazon API Gateway Supports Canary Release Deployments</a> – You can now use canary release deployments to gradually roll out new APIs. This helps you more safely roll out API changes and limit the blast radius of new deployments.</li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/amazon-api-gateway-supports-access-logging/">Amazon API Gateway Supports Access Logging</a> – The access logging feature lets you generate access logs in different formats such as CLF (Common Log Format), JSON, XML, and CSV. The access logs can be fed into your existing analytics or log processing tools so you can perform more in-depth analysis or take action in response to the log data.</li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/customize-integration-timeouts-in-amazon-api-gateway/">Amazon API Gateway Customize Integration Timeouts</a> – You can now set a custom timeout for your API calls as low as 50ms and as high as 29 seconds (the default is 30 seconds).</li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/amazon-api-gateway-supports-generating-sdk-in-ruby/">Amazon API Gateway Supports Generating SDK in Ruby</a> – This is in addition to support for SDKs in Java, JavaScript, Android and iOS (Swift and Objective-C). The SDKs that Amazon API Gateway generates save you development time and come with a number of prebuilt capabilities, such as working with API keys, exponential back, and exception handling.</li> 
<b>AWS Serverless Application Repository</b> 
<p>Serverless Application Repository is a new service (currently in preview) that aids in the publication, discovery, and deployment of serverless applications. With it you’ll be able to find shared serverless applications that you can launch in your account, while also sharing ones that you’ve created for others to do the same.</p>

<b>AWS re:Invent 2017 sessions</b> 
<p>Coming up with the right mix of talks for an event like this can be quite a challenge. The Product, Marketing, and Developer Advocacy teams for Serverless at AWS spent weeks reading through dozens of talk ideas to boil it down to the final list.</p> 
<p>From feedback at other AWS events and webinars, we knew that customers were looking for talks that focused on concrete examples of solving problems with serverless, how to perform common tasks such as deployment, CI/CD, monitoring, and troubleshooting, and to see customer and partner examples solving real world problems. To that extent we tried to settle on a good mix based on attendee experience and provide a track full of rich content.</p> 
<p>Below are the recordings and slides of breakout sessions from re:Invent 2017. We’ve organized them for those getting started, those who are already beginning to build serverless applications, and the experts out there already running them at scale. Some of the videos and slides haven’t been posted yet, and so we will update this list as they become available.</p>

<p><em>This post contributed by Laura Thomson, Senior Product Manager for Amazon EC2.</em></p> 
<p>As you start planning for the new year, I want to give you a heads up that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2">Amazon EC2</a> is migrating to longer format, 17-character resource IDs. Instances and volumes currently already receive this ID format. Beginning in July 2018, all newly created EC2 resources receive longer IDs as well.</p> 
<p>The switch-over will not impact most customers. However, I wanted to make you aware so that you can schedule time at the beginning of 2018 to test your systems with the longer format. If you have a system that parses or stores resource IDs, you may be affected.</p> 
<p>From January 2018 through the end of June 2018, there will be a transition period, during which you can opt in to receive longer IDs. To make this easy, AWS will provide an option to opt in with one click for all regions, resources, and users. AWS will also provide more granular controls via API operations and console support. More information on the opt-in process will be sent out in January.</p> 
<p>We need to do this given how fast AWS is continuing to grow. We will start to run low on IDs for certain resources within a year or so. In order to enable the long-term, uninterrupted creation of new resources, we need to move to the longer ID format.</p> 
<p>The current format is a resource identifier followed by an eight-character string. The new format is the same resource identifier followed by a 17-character string. For example, your current VPCs have resource identifiers such as “vpc-1234abc0”. Starting July 2018, new VPCs will be assigned an identifier such as “vpc-1234567890abcdef0”. You can continue using the existing eight-character IDs for your existing resources, which won’t change and will continue to be supported. Only new resources will receive the 17-character IDs and only after you opt in to the new format.</p> 
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#longer-ids">Longer EC2, EBS, and Storage Gateway Resource IDs</a>.&nbsp; If you have any questions, contact AWS Support on the community forums and via <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/">AWS Support</a>.</p>

<p>One of the key benefits of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/">serverless applications</a> is the ease in which they can scale to meet traffic demands or requests, with little to no need for capacity planning. In <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda">AWS Lambda</a>, which is the core of the serverless platform at AWS, the unit of scale is a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/concurrent-executions.html">concurrent execution</a>. This refers to the number of executions of your function code that are happening at any given time.</p> 
<p>Thinking about concurrent executions as a unit of scale is a fairly unique concept. In this post, I dive deeper into this and talk about how you can make use of per function concurrency limits in Lambda.<br /> <span id="more-3483"></span></p> 
<b>Understanding concurrency in Lambda</b> 
<p>Instead of diving right into the guts of how Lambda works, here’s an appetizing analogy: <strong>a magical pizza</strong>.<br /> Yes, a magical pizza!</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/11/pizza.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/11/pizza-300x300.png" /></a></p> 
<p>This magical pizza has some unique properties:</p> 
<li>It has a fixed maximum number of slices, such as 8.</li> 
<li>Slices automatically re-appear after they are consumed.</li> 
<li>When you take a slice from the pizza, it does not re-appear until it has been completely consumed.</li> 
<li>One person can take multiple slices at a time.</li> 
<li>You can easily ask to have the number of slices increased, but they remain fixed at any point in time otherwise.</li> 
<p>Now that the magical pizza’s properties are defined, here’s a hypothetical situation of some friends sharing this pizza.</p> 
<p>Shawn, Kate, Daniela, Chuck, Ian and Avleen get together every Friday to share a pizza and catch up on their week. As there is just six of them, they can easily all enjoy a slice of pizza at a time. As they finish each slice, it re-appears in the pizza&nbsp;pan&nbsp;and they can take another slice again. Given the magical properties of their pizza, they can continue to eat all they want, but with two very important constraints:</p> 
<li>If any of them take too many slices at once, the others may not get as much as they want.</li> 
<li>If they take too many slices, they might also eat too much and get sick.</li> 
<p>One particular week, some of the friends are hungrier than the rest, taking two slices at a time instead of just one. If more than two of them try to take two pieces at a time, this can cause contention for pizza slices. Some of them would wait hungry for the slices to re-appear. They could ask for a pizza with more slices, but then run the same risk again later if more hungry friends join than planned for.</p> 
<p>What can they do?</p> 
<p>If the friends agreed to accept a limit for the maximum number of slices they each eat concurrently, both of these issues are avoided. Some could have a maximum of 2 of the 8 slices, or other concurrency limits that were more or less. Just so long as they kept it at or under eight total slices to be eaten at one time. This would keep any from going hungry or eating too much. The six friends can happily enjoy their magical pizza without worry!</p> 
<b>Concurrency in Lambda</b> 
<p>Concurrency in Lambda actually works similarly to the magical pizza model. Each AWS Account has an overall <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_GetAccountSettings.html">AccountLimit</a> value that is fixed at any point in time, but can be easily increased as needed, just like the count of slices in the pizza. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/05/aws-lambda-raises-default-concurrent-execution-limit/">As of May 2017</a>, the default limit is 1000 “slices” of concurrency per AWS Region.</p> 
<p>Also like the magical pizza, each concurrency “slice” can only be consumed individually one at a time. After consumption, it becomes available to be consumed again. Services invoking Lambda functions can consume multiple slices of concurrency at the same time, just like the group of friends can take multiple slices of the pizza.</p> 
<p>Let’s take our example of the six friends and bring it back to AWS services that commonly invoke Lambda:</p> 
<li>Amazon S3</li> 
<li>Amazon Kinesis</li> 
<li>Amazon DynamoDB</li> 
<li>Amazon Cognito</li> 
<p>In a single account with the default concurrency limit of 1000 concurrent executions, any of these four services could invoke enough functions to consume the entire limit or some part of it. Just like with the pizza example, there is the possibility for two issues to pop up:</p> 
<li>One or more of these services could invoke enough functions to consume a majority of the available concurrency capacity. This could cause others to be starved for it, causing failed invocations.</li> 
<li>A service could consume too much concurrent capacity and cause a downstream service or database to be overwhelmed, which could cause failed executions.</li> 
<p>For Lambda functions that are launched in a VPC, you have the potential to consume the available IP addresses in a subnet or the maximum number of elastic network interfaces to which your account has access. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/vpc.html">Configuring a Lambda Function to Access Resources in an Amazon VPC</a>. For information about elastic network interface limits, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Appendix_Limits.html#vpc-limits-enis">Network Interfaces</a> section in the Amazon VPC Limits topic.</p> 
<p>One way to solve both of these problems is applying a concurrency limit to the Lambda functions in an account.</p> 
<b>Configuring per function concurrency limits</b> 
<p>You can now set a concurrency limit on individual Lambda functions in an account. The concurrency limit that you set reserves a portion of your account level concurrency for a given function. All of your functions’ concurrent executions count against this account-level limit by default.</p> 
<p>If you set a concurrency limit for a specific function, then that function’s concurrency limit allocation is deducted from the shared pool and assigned to that specific function. AWS also reserves 100 units of concurrency for all functions that don’t have a specified concurrency limit set. This helps to make sure that future functions have capacity to be consumed.</p> 
<p>Going back to the example of the consuming services, you could set throttles for the functions as follows:</p> 
<p>Amazon S3 function = 350<br /> Amazon Kinesis function = 200<br /> Amazon DynamoDB function = 200<br /> Amazon Cognito function = 150<br /> Total = 900</p> 
<p>With the 100 reserved for all non-concurrency reserved functions, this totals the account limit of 1000.</p> 
<p>Here’s how this works. To start, create a basic Lambda function that is invoked via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway">Amazon API Gateway</a>. This Lambda function returns a single “Hello World” statement with an added sleep time between 2 and 5 seconds. The sleep time simulates an API providing some sort of capability that can take a varied amount of time. The goal here is to show how an API that is underloaded can reach its concurrency limit, and what happens when it does.<br /> <strong>To create the example function</strong></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Open the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home">Lambda console</a>.</li> 
<li>Choose <strong>Create Function</strong>.</li> 
<li>For <strong>Author from scratch</strong>, enter the following values: 
<ol> 
<li>For <strong>Name</strong>, enter a value (such as concurrencyBlog01).</li> 
<li>For <strong>Runtime</strong>, choose <strong>Python 3.6</strong>.</li> 
<li>For <strong>Role</strong>, choose <strong>Create new role from template</strong> and enter a name aligned with this function, such as concurrencyBlogRole.</li> 
</ol> </li> 
<li>Choose <strong>Create function</strong>.</li> 
<li>The function is created with some basic example code. Replace that code with the following:</li> 
</ol> 
<code class="lang-python">
import time
from random import randint
seconds = randint(2, 5)
def lambda_handler(event, context):
time.sleep(seconds)
return {&quot;statusCode&quot;: 200,
&quot;body&quot;: (&quot;Hello world, slept &quot; + str(seconds) + &quot; seconds&quot;),
&quot;headers&quot;:
{
&quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&quot;: &quot;Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token&quot;,
&quot;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&quot;: &quot;GET,OPTIONS&quot;,
}}

</code> 
<ol start="6"> 
<li>Under <strong>Basic settings</strong>, set <strong>Timeout</strong> to 10 seconds. While this function should only ever take up to 5-6 seconds (with the 5-second max sleep), this gives you a little bit of room if it takes longer.</li> 
</ol> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/11/basic-settings.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/11/basic-settings.png" /></a></p> 
<ol start="7"> 
<li>Choose <strong>Save</strong> at the top right.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>At this point, your function is configured for this example. Test it and confirm this in the console:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Choose <strong>Test</strong>.</li> 
<li>Enter a name (it doesn’t matter for this example).</li> 
<li>Choose <strong>Create</strong>.</li> 
<li>In the console, choose <strong>Test</strong> again.</li> 
<li>You should see output similar to the following:</li> 
</ol> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/11/test-success.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/11/test-success.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Now configure API Gateway so that you have an HTTPS endpoint to test against.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>In the Lambda console, choose <strong>Configuration</strong>.</li> 
<li>Under <strong>Triggers</strong>, choose <strong>API Gateway</strong>.</li> 
<li>Open the API Gateway icon now shown as attached to your Lambda function:</li> 
</ol> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/11/triggers.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/11/triggers.png" /></a></p> 
<ol start="4"> 
<li>Under <strong>Configure triggers</strong>, leave the default values for <strong>API Name</strong> and <strong>Deployment stage</strong>. For <strong>Security</strong>, choose <strong>Open</strong>.</li> 
<li>Choose <strong>Add, Save</strong>.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>API Gateway is now configured to invoke Lambda at the Invoke URL shown under its configuration. You can take this URL and test it in any browser or command line, using tools such as “curl”:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">
$ curl https://ofixul557l.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/concurrencyBlog01
Hello world, slept 2 seconds
</code> 
<h3>Throwing load at the function</h3> 
<p>Now start throwing some load against your API Gateway + Lambda function combo. Right now, your function is only limited by the total amount of concurrency available in an account. For this example account, you might have 850 unreserved concurrency out of a full account limit of 1000 due to having configured a few concurrency limits already (also the 100 concurrency saved for all functions without configured limits). You can find all of this information on the main <strong>Dashboard</strong> page of the Lambda console:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/11/lambda-dash.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/11/lambda-dash.png" /></a></p> 
<p>For generating load in this example, use an open source tool called “hey” (<a href="https://github.com/rakyll/hey">https://github.com/rakyll/hey</a>), which works similarly to ApacheBench (<a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html">ab</a>). You test from an Amazon EC2 instance running the default Amazon Linux AMI from the EC2 console. For more help with configuring an EC2 instance, follow the steps in the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#LaunchInstanceWizard:">Launch Instance Wizard</a>.</p> 
<p>After the EC2 instance is running, SSH into the host and run the following:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">
sudo yum install go
go get -u github.com/rakyll/hey
</code> 
<p>“hey” is easy to use. For these tests, specify a total number of tests (5,000) and a concurrency of 50 against the API Gateway URL as follows(replace the URL here with your own):</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">
$ ./go/bin/hey -n 5000 -c 50 https://ofixul557l.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/concurrencyBlog01
</code> 
<p>The output from “hey” tells you interesting bits of information:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">
$ ./go/bin/hey -n 5000 -c 50 https://ofixul557l.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/concurrencyBlog01

<p>You can see a helpful histogram and latency distribution. Remember that this Lambda function has a random sleep period in it and so isn’t entirely representational of a real-life workload. Those three 502s warrant digging deeper, but could be due to Lambda cold-start timing and the “second” variable being the maximum of 5, causing the Lambda functions to time out. AWS X-Ray and the Amazon CloudWatch logs generated by both API Gateway and Lambda could help you troubleshoot this.</p> 
<h3>Configuring a concurrency reservation</h3> 
<p>Now that you’ve established that you can generate this load against the function, I show you how to limit it and protect a backend resource from being overloaded by all of these requests.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>In the console, choose <strong>Configure</strong>.</li> 
<li>Under <strong>Concurrency</strong>, for <strong>Reserve concurrency</strong>, enter 25.</li> 
</ol> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/11/concurrency.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/11/concurrency.png" /></a></p> 
<ol start="3"> 
<li>Click on <strong>Save</strong> in the top right corner.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>You could also set this with the AWS CLI using the Lambda&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/put-function-concurrency.html">put-function-concurrency</a> command or see your current concurrency configuration via Lambda get-function. Here’s an example command:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">
$ aws lambda get-function --function-name concurrencyBlog01 --output json --query Concurrency
{
&quot;ReservedConcurrentExecutions&quot;: 25
}
</code> 
<p>Either way, you’ve set the Concurrency Reservation to 25 for this function. This acts as both a limit and a reservation in terms of making sure that you can execute 25 concurrent functions at all times. Going above this results in the throttling of the Lambda function. Depending on the invoking service, throttling can result in a number of different outcomes, as shown in the documentation on <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/concurrent-executions.html">Throttling Behavior</a>. This change has also reduced your unreserved account concurrency for other functions by 25.</p> 
<p>Rerun the same load generation as before and see what happens. Previously, you tested at 50 concurrency, which worked just fine. By limiting the Lambda functions to 25 concurrency, you should see rate limiting kick in. Run the same test again:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">
$ ./go/bin/hey -n 5000 -c 50 https://ofixul557l.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/concurrencyBlog01
</code> 
<p>While this test runs, refresh the <strong>Monitoring</strong> tab on your function detail page. You see the following warning message:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/11/warning.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/11/warning.png" /></a></p> 
<p>This is great! It means that your throttle is working as configured and you are now protecting your downstream resources from too much load from your Lambda function.</p> 
<p>Here is the output from a new “hey” command:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">

</code> 
<p>This looks fairly different from the last load test run. A large percentage of these requests failed fast due to the concurrency throttle failing them (those with the 0.724 seconds line). The timing shown here in the histogram represents the entire time it took to get a response between the EC2 instance and API Gateway calling Lambda and being rejected. It’s also important to note that this example was configured with an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-api-migration.html">edge-optimized endpoint</a> in API Gateway. You see under <strong>Status code distribution</strong> that 3076 of the 5000 requests failed with a 502, showing that the backend service from API Gateway and Lambda failed the request.</p> 
<b>Other uses</b> 
<p>Managing function concurrency can be useful in a few other ways beyond just limiting the impact on downstream services and providing a reservation of concurrency capacity. Here are two other uses:</p> 
<li>Emergency kill switch</li> 
<li>Cost controls</li> 
<h3>Emergency kill switch</h3> 
<p>On occasion, due to issues with applications I’ve managed in the past, I’ve had a need to disable a certain function or capability of an application. By setting the concurrency reservation and limit of a Lambda function to zero, you can do just that.</p> 
<p>With the reservation set to zero every invocation of a Lambda function results in being throttled. You could then work on the related parts of the infrastructure or application that aren’t working, and then reconfigure the concurrency limit to allow invocations again.</p> 
<h3>Cost controls</h3> 
<p>While I mentioned how you might want to use concurrency limits to control the downstream impact to services or databases that your Lambda function might call, another resource that you might be cautious about is money. Setting the concurrency throttle is another way to help control costs during development and testing of your application.</p> 
<p>You might want to prevent against a function performing a recursive action too quickly or a development workload generating too high of a concurrency. You might also want to protect development resources connected to this function from generating too much cost, such as APIs that your Lambda function calls.</p> 
<b>Conclusion</b> 
<p>Concurrent executions as a unit of scale are a fairly unique characteristic about Lambda functions. Placing limits on how many concurrency “slices” that your function can consume can prevent a single function from consuming all of the available concurrency in an account. Limits can also prevent a function from overwhelming a backend resource that isn’t as scalable.</p> 
<p>Unlike monolithic applications or even microservices where there are mixed capabilities in a single service, Lambda functions encourage a sort of “nano-service” of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/best-practices.html">small business logic</a> directly related to the integration model connected to the function. I hope you’ve enjoyed this post and configure your concurrency limits today!</p>

<p>—</p> 
<p>Containers have revolutionized the way that developers build, package, deploy, and run applications. Initially, containers only supported code and tooling for Linux applications. With the release of Docker Engine for Windows Server 2016, Windows developers have started to realize the gains that their Linux counterparts have experienced for the last several years.</p> 
<p>This week, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/12/amazon-ecs-support-for-windows-server-containers-ga/">we’re adding support</a> for running production workloads in Windows containers using Amazon Elastic Container Service (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs">Amazon ECS</a>). Now, Amazon ECS provides an ECS-Optimized&nbsp;Windows Server Amazon Machine Image (AMI). This AMI is based on the EC2 Windows Server 2016&nbsp;AMI, and includes Docker 17.06 Enterprise Edition and the ECS Agent 1.16. This AMI provides improved&nbsp;instance and container launch time performance.&nbsp;It’s based on Windows Server&nbsp;2016 Datacenter and includes Docker 17.06.2-ee-5, along with a new version of the ECS agent that now runs as a native Windows service.<span id="more-3464"></span></p> 
<p>In this post, I discuss the benefits of this new support, and walk you through getting started running Windows containers with Amazon ECS.</p> 
<p>When AWS released the Windows Server 2016 Base with Containers AMI, the ECS agent ran as a process that made it difficult to monitor and manage. As a service, the agent can be health-checked, managed, and restarted no differently than other Windows services. The AMI also includes pre-cached images for Windows Server&nbsp;Core 2016 and Windows Server&nbsp;Nano&nbsp;Server 2016. By caching the images in the AMI, launching new Windows containers is significantly faster. When Docker images include a layer that’s already cached on the instance, Docker re-uses that layer instead of pulling it from the Docker registry.</p> 
<p>The ECS agent and an accompanying ECS PowerShell module used to install, configure, and run the agent come pre-installed on the AMI. This guarantees there is a specific platform version available on the container instance at launch. Because the software is included, you don’t have to download it from the internet. This saves startup time.</p> 
<p>The Windows-compatible ECS-optimized AMI also reports CPU and memory utilization and reservation metrics to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch">Amazon CloudWatch</a>. Using the CloudWatch integration with ECS, you can create alarms that trigger dynamic scaling events to automatically add or remove capacity to your EC2 instances and ECS tasks.</p> 
<b>Getting started</b> 
<p>To help you get started running Windows containers on ECS, I’ve forked the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/ecs-refarch-cloudformation">ECS reference architecture</a>, to build an ECS cluster comprised of Windows instances instead of Linux instances. You can pull the latest version of the <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/ecs-refarch-cloudformation-windows">reference architecture for Windows</a>.</p> 
<p>The reference architecture is a layered CloudFormation stack, in that it calls other stacks to create the environment. Within the stack, the ecs-windows-cluster.yaml file contains the instructions for bootstrapping the Windows instances and configuring the ECS cluster. To configure the instances outside of AWS CloudFormation (for example, through the CLI or the console), you can add the following commands to your instance’s user data:</p> 
<code class="lang-yaml">Import-Module ECSTools
Initialize-ECSAgent</code> 
<p>Or</p> 
<code class="lang-yaml">Import-Module ECSTools
Initialize-ECSAgent –Cluster MyCluster -EnableIAMTaskRole</code> 
<p>If you don’t specify a cluster name when you initialize the agent, the instance is joined to the default cluster.</p> 
<p>Adding <code class="lang-bash">-EnableIAMTaskRole</code> when initializing the agent adds support for IAM roles for tasks. Previously, enabling this setting meant running a complex script and setting an environment variable before you could assign roles to your ECS tasks.</p> 
<p>When you enable IAM roles for tasks on Windows, it consumes port 80 on the host. If you have tasks that listen on&nbsp;port 80 on the host, I recommend configuring a service for them that uses load balancing. You can use port 80 on the load balancer, and the traffic can be routed to another host port on your container instances. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html">Service Load Balancing</a>.</p> 
<h3>Create a cluster</h3> 
<p>To create a new ECS cluster, choose Launch stack, or pull the GitHub project to your local machine and run the following command:</p> 
<p><code class="lang-bash">aws cloudformation create-stack –template-body file://&lt;path to master-windows.yaml&gt; --stack-name &lt;name&gt;</code></p> 
<h3>Upload your container image</h3> 
<p>Now that you have a cluster running, step through how to build and push an image into a container repository. You use a repository hosted in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr">Amazon ECR</a>) for this, but you could also use Docker Hub. To build and push an image to a repository, install Docker on your Windows* workstation. You also create a repository and assign the necessary permissions to the account that pushes your image to Amazon ECR. For detailed instructions, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/docker-push-ecr-image.html">Pushing an Image</a>.</p> 
<p><em>* If you are building an image that is based on Windows layers, then you must use a Windows environment to build and push your image to the registry.</em></p> 
<h3>Write your task definition</h3> 
<p>Now that your image is built and ready, the next step is to run your Windows containers using a task.</p> 
<p>Start by creating a new task definition based on the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/iis">windows-simple-iis</a> image from Docker Hub.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Open the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home">ECS console</a>.</li> 
<li>Choose <strong>Task Definitions</strong>, <strong>Create new task definition</strong>.</li> 
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the page and choose <strong>Configure via JSON</strong>.</li> 
<li>Copy and paste the following JSON into that field.</li> 
<li>Choose <strong>Save, Create</strong>.</li> 
</ol> 
<code class="lang-json">{
&quot;family&quot;: &quot;windows-simple-iis&quot;,
&quot;containerDefinitions&quot;: [
{
&quot;name&quot;: &quot;windows_sample_app&quot;,
&quot;image&quot;: &quot;microsoft/iis&quot;,
&quot;cpu&quot;: 100,
&quot;entryPoint&quot;:[&quot;powershell&quot;, &quot;-Command&quot;],
&quot;command&quot;:[&quot;New-Item -Path C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\index.html -Type file -Value '&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Amazon ECS Sample App&lt;/title&gt; &lt;style&gt;body {margin-top: 40px; background-color: #333;} &lt;/style&gt; &lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt; &lt;div style=color:white;text-align:center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amazon ECS Sample App&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Congratulations!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your application is now running on a container in Amazon ECS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;'; C:\\ServiceMonitor.exe w3svc&quot;],
&quot;portMappings&quot;: [
{
&quot;protocol&quot;: &quot;tcp&quot;,
&quot;containerPort&quot;: 80,
&quot;hostPort&quot;: 8080
}
],
&quot;memory&quot;: 500,
&quot;essential&quot;: true
}
]
}</code> 
<p>You can now go back into the Task Definition page and see <code class="lang-bash">windows-simple-iis</code> as an available task definition.</p> 
<p>There are a&nbsp;few important aspects of the task definition file to note when working with Windows containers. First, the hostPort is configured as 8080, which is necessary because the ECS agent currently uses port 80 to enable IAM roles for tasks required for least-privilege security configurations.</p> 
<p>There are also some fairly standard task parameters that are intentionally not included. For example, network mode is not available with Windows at the time of this release, so keep that setting blank to allow Docker to configure WinNAT, the only option available today.</p> 
<p>Also, some parameters work differently with Windows than they do with Linux. The CPU limits that you define in the task definition are absolute, whereas on Linux they are weights. For information about other task parameters that are supported or possibly different with Windows, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/windows_task_definitions.html#windows_sample_task_defs">documentation</a>.</p> 
<h3>Run your containers</h3> 
<p>At this point, you are ready to run containers. There are two options to run containers with ECS:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Task</li> 
<li>Service</li> 
</ol> 
<p>A task is typically a short-lived process that ECS creates. It can’t be configured to actively monitor or scale. A service is meant for longer-running containers and can be configured to use a load balancer, minimum/maximum capacity settings, and a number of other knobs and switches to help ensure that your code keeps running. In both cases, you are able to pick a placement strategy and a specific IAM role for your container.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Select the task definition that you created above and choose Action, Run Task.</li> 
<li>Leave the settings on the next page to the default values.</li> 
<li>Select the ECS cluster created when you ran the CloudFormation template.</li> 
<li>Choose Run Task to start the process of scheduling a Docker container on your ECS cluster.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>You can now go to the cluster and watch the status of your task. It may take 5–10 minutes for the task to go from <strong>PENDING</strong> to <strong>RUNNING</strong>, mostly because it takes time to download all of the layers necessary to run the&nbsp;<em>microsoft/iis</em> image. After the status is <strong>RUNNING</strong>, you should see the following results:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/06/17-12-Windows-GA-1.png" /></p> 
<p>You may have noticed that the example task definition is&nbsp;named <em>windows-simple-iis:2</em>. This is because I created a second version of the task definition, which is one of the powerful capabilities of using ECS. You can make the task definitions part of your source code and then version them. You can also roll out new versions and practice blue/green deployment, switching to reduce downtime and improve the velocity of your deployments!</p> 
<p>After the task has moved to <strong>RUNNING</strong>, you can see your website hosted in ECS. Find the public IP or DNS for your ECS host. Remember that you are hosting on port 8080. Make sure that the security group allows ingress from your client IP address to that port and that your VPC has an internet gateway associated with it. You should see a page that looks like the following:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/06/17-12-Windows-GA-2.png" /></p> 
<p>This is a nice start to deploying a simple single instance task, but what if you had a Web API to be scaled out and in based on usage? This is where you could look at defining a service and collecting CloudWatch data to add and remove both instances of the task. You could also use CloudWatch alarms to add more ECS container instances and keep up with the demand. The former is built into the configuration of your service.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Select the task definition and choose&nbsp;<strong>Create Service</strong>.</li> 
<li>Associate a load balancer.</li> 
<li>Set up Auto Scaling.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>The following screenshot shows an example where you would add an additional task instance when the <strong>CPU Utilization</strong> CloudWatch metric is over 60% on average over three consecutive measurements. This may not be aggressive enough for your requirements; it’s meant to show you the option to scale tasks the same way you scale ECS instances with an Auto Scaling group. The difference is that these tasks start much faster because all of the base layers are already on the ECS host.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/06/17-12-Windows-GA-3.png" /></p> 
<p>Do not confuse task dynamic scaling with ECS instance dynamic scaling. To add additional hosts, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cloudwatch_alarm_autoscaling.html">Tutorial: Scaling Container Instances with CloudWatch Alarms</a>.</p> 
<b>Conclusion</b> 
<p>This is just scratching the surface of the flexibility that you get from using containers and Amazon ECS. For more information, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html">Amazon ECS Developer Guide</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/resources">ECS Resources</a>.</p>

<h5><strong>This post contributed by:<br /> Wangechi Dole, AWS Solutions Architect<em><br /> </em>Milan Krasnansky, ING, Digital Solutions Developer, SGK<em><br /> </em>Rian Mookencherry, Director – Product Innovation, SGK</strong></h5> 
<p>Data processing and transformation is a common use case you see in our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/">customer case studies and success stories</a>. Often, customers deal with complex data from a variety of sources that needs to be transformed and customized through a series of steps to make it useful to different systems and stakeholders. This can be difficult due to the ever-increasing volume, velocity, and variety of data. Today, data management challenges cannot be solved with traditional databases.</p> 
<p>Workflow automation helps you build solutions that are repeatable, scalable, and reliable. You can use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions">AWS Step Functions</a> for this. A great example is how <a href="http://www.sgkinc.com/">SGK</a> used Step Functions to automate the ETL processes for their client. With Step Functions, SGK has been able to automate changes within the data management system, substantially reducing the time required for data processing.</p> 
<p>In this post, SGK shares the details of how they used Step Functions to build a robust data processing system based on highly configurable business transformation rules for ETL processes.</p> 
<b>SGK: Building dynamic ETL pipelines</b> 
<p>SGK is a subsidiary of Matthews International Corporation, a diversified organization focusing on brand solutions and industrial technologies. SGK’s Global Content Creation Studio network creates compelling content and solutions that connect brands and products to consumers through multiple assets including photography, video, and copywriting.</p> 
<p>We were recently contracted to build a sophisticated and scalable data management system for one of our clients. We chose to build the solution on AWS to leverage advanced, managed services that help to improve the speed and agility of development.</p> 
<p>The data management system served two main functions:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Ingesting a large amount of complex data to facilitate both reporting and product funding decisions for the client’s global marketing and supply chain organizations.</li> 
<li>Processing the data through normalization and applying complex algorithms and data transformations. The system goal was to provide information in the relevant context—such as strategic marketing, supply chain, product planning, etc. —to the end consumer through automated data feeds or updates to existing ETL systems.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>We were faced with several challenges:</p> 
<li>Output data that needed to be refreshed at least twice a day to provide fresh datasets to both local and global markets. That constant data refresh posed several challenges, especially around data management and replication across multiple databases.</li> 
<li>The complexity of reporting business rules that needed to be updated on a constant basis.</li> 
<li>Data that could not be processed as contiguous blocks of typical time-series data. The measurement of the data was done across seasons (that is, combination of dates), which often resulted with up to three overlapping seasons at any given time.</li> 
<li>Input data that came from 10+ different data sources. Each data source ranged from 1–20K rows with as many as 85 columns per input source.</li> 
<p>These challenges meant that our small Dev team heavily invested time in frequent configuration changes to the system and data integrity verification to make sure that everything was operating properly. Maintaining this system proved to be a daunting task and that’s when we turned to Step Functions—along with other AWS services—to automate our ETL processes.</p> 
<h3>Solution overview</h3> 
<p>Our solution included the following AWS services:</p> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/">AWS Step Functions</a>: Before Step Functions was available, we were using multiple Lambda functions for this use case and running into memory limit issues. With Step Functions, we can execute steps in parallel simultaneously, in a cost-efficient manner, without running into memory limitations.</li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>: The Step Functions state machine uses Lambda functions to implement the Task states. Our Lambda functions are implemented in Java 8.</li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a> provides us with an easy and flexible way to manage business rules. We specify our rules as Keys. These are key-value pairs stored in a DynamoDB table.</li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon RDS</a>: Our ETL pipelines consume source data from our RDS MySQL database.</li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/">Amazon Redshift</a>: We use Amazon Redshift for reporting purposes because it integrates with our BI tools. Currently we are using Tableau for reporting which integrates well with Amazon Redshift.</li> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>: We store our raw input files and intermediate results in S3 buckets.</li>

<h3>Solution architecture</h3> 
<p>This solution uses a&nbsp;declarative&nbsp;approach to defining business transformation rules that are applied by the underlying Step Functions state machine as data moves from RDS to Amazon Redshift.&nbsp;An S3 bucket is used to store intermediate results. A CloudWatch Event rule triggers the Step Functions state machine on a schedule. The following diagram illustrates our architecture:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/05/SGK_Arch_Diagram_Resized-1.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/05/SGK_Arch_Diagram_Resized-1.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Here are more details for the above diagram:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>A rule in CloudWatch Events triggers the state machine execution on an automated schedule.</li> 
<li>The state machine invokes the first Lambda function.</li> 
<li>The Lambda function deletes all existing records in Amazon Redshift. Depending on the dataset, the Lambda function can create a new table in Amazon Redshift to hold the data.</li> 
<li>The same Lambda function then retrieves Keys from a DynamoDB table. Keys represent specific marketing campaigns or seasons and map to specific records in RDS.</li> 
<li>The state machine executes the second Lambda function using the Keys from DynamoDB.</li> 
<li>The second Lambda function retrieves the referenced dataset from RDS. The records retrieved represent the entire dataset needed for a specific marketing campaign.</li> 
<li>The second Lambda function executes in parallel for each Key retrieved from DynamoDB and stores the output in CSV format temporarily in S3.</li> 
<li>Finally, the Lambda function uploads the data into Amazon Redshift.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>To understand the above data processing workflow, take a closer look at the Step Functions state machine for this example.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/05/SGK_statemacine_1.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/05/SGK_statemacine_1.png" /></a></p> 
<p>We walk you through the state machine in more detail in the following sections.</p> 
<h3>Walkthrough</h3> 
<p>To get started, you need to:</p> 
<li>Create a schedule in CloudWatch Events</li> 
<li>Specify conditions for RDS data extracts</li> 
<li>Create Amazon Redshift input files</li> 
<li>Load data into Amazon Redshift</li> 
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a schedule in CloudWatch Events</strong><br /> Create rules in CloudWatch Events to trigger the Step Functions state machine on an automated schedule. The following is an example cron expression to automate your schedule:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/05/EventSource_resized.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/05/EventSource_resized.png" /></a></p> 
<p>In this example, the cron expression invokes the Step Functions state machine at 3:00am and 2:00pm (UTC) every day.</p> 
<p><strong>Step 2: Specify conditions for RDS data extracts</strong><br /> We use DynamoDB to store Keys that determine which rows of data to extract from our RDS MySQL database. An example Key is MCS2017, which stands for, Marketing Campaign Spring 2017. Each campaign has a specific start and end date and the corresponding dataset is stored in RDS MySQL. A record in RDS contains about 600 columns, and each Key can represent up to 20K records.</p> 
<p>A given day can have multiple campaigns with different start and end dates running simultaneously. In the following example DynamoDB item, three campaigns are specified for the given date.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/05/campaigns_resized.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/05/campaigns_resized.png" /></a></p> 
<p>The state machine example shown above&nbsp;uses Keys 31, 32, and 33 in the first ChoiceState and Keys 21 and 22 in the second ChoiceState. These keys represent marketing campaigns for a given day. For example, on Monday, there are only two campaigns requested. The ChoiceState with Keys 21 and 22 is executed. If three campaigns are requested on Tuesday, for example, then ChoiceState with Keys 31, 32, and 33 is executed. MCS2017 can be represented by Key 21 and Key 33 on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. This approach gives us the flexibility to add or remove campaigns dynamically.</p> 
<p><strong>Step 3: Create Amazon Redshift input files</strong><br /> When the state machine begins execution, the first Lambda function is invoked as the resource for FirstState, represented in the Step Functions state machine as follows:</p> 
<code class="lang-json">&quot;Comment&quot;: ” AWS Amazon States Language.&quot;, 
&quot;StartAt&quot;: &quot;FirstState&quot;,
 &quot;States&quot;: { 
&quot;FirstState&quot;: {
 &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Task&quot;,
 &quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:lambda:xx-xxxx-x:XXXXXXXXXXXX:function:Start&quot;,
&quot;Next&quot;: &quot;ChoiceState&quot; 
} </code> 
<p>As described in the solution architecture, the purpose of this Lambda function is to delete existing data in Amazon Redshift and retrieve keys from DynamoDB. In our use case, we found that deleting existing records was more efficient and less time-consuming than finding the delta and updating existing records. On average, an Amazon Redshift table can contain about 36 million cells, which translates to roughly 65K records. The following is the code snippet for the first Lambda function in Java 8:</p> 
<code class="lang-java">public class LambdaFunctionHandler implements RequestHandler&lt;Map&lt;String,Object&gt;,Map&lt;String,String&gt;&gt; {
Map&lt;String,String&gt; keys= new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
public Map&lt;String, String&gt; handleRequest(Map&lt;String, Object&gt; input, Context context){
Properties config = getConfig(); 
// 1. Cleaning Redshift Database
new RedshiftDataService(config).cleaningTable(); 
// 2. Reading data from Dynamodb
List&lt;String&gt; keyList = new DynamoDBDataService(config).getCurrentKeys();
for(int i = 0; i &lt; keyList.size(); i++) {
keys.put(”key&quot; + (i+1), keyList.get(i)); 
}
keys.put(”key&quot; + T,String.valueOf(keyList.size()));
// 3. Returning the key values and the key count from the “for” loop
return (keys);
}</code> 
<p>The following JSON represents ChoiceState.</p> 
<code class="lang-json">&quot;ChoiceState&quot;: {
&quot;Type&quot; : &quot;Choice&quot;,
&quot;Choices&quot;: [ 
{ 
&quot;Variable&quot;: &quot;$.keyT&quot;,
&quot;StringEquals&quot;: &quot;3&quot;,
&quot;Next&quot;: &quot;CurrentThreeKeys&quot; 
}, 
{ 
&quot;Variable&quot;: &quot;$.keyT&quot;,
&quot;StringEquals&quot;: &quot;2&quot;,
&quot;Next&quot;: &quot;CurrentTwooKeys&quot; 
} 
], 
&quot;Default&quot;: &quot;DefaultState&quot;
}
</code> 
<p>The variable $.keyT represents the number of keys retrieved from DynamoDB. This variable determines which of the parallel branches should be executed. At the time of publication, Step Functions does not support dynamic parallel state. Therefore, choices under ChoiceState are manually created and assigned hardcoded StringEquals values. These values represent the number of parallel executions for the second Lambda function.</p> 
<p>For example, if $.keyT equals 3, the second Lambda function is executed three times in parallel with keys, $key1, $key2 and $key3 retrieved from DynamoDB. Similarly, if $.keyT equals two, the second Lambda function is executed twice in parallel. &nbsp;The following JSON represents this parallel execution:</p> 
<code class="lang-json">&quot;CurrentThreeKeys&quot;: { 
&quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Parallel&quot;,
&quot;Next&quot;: &quot;NextState&quot;,
&quot;Branches&quot;: [ 
{ 
&quot;StartAt&quot;: “key31&quot;,
&quot;States&quot;: { 
“key31&quot;: { 
&quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Task&quot;,
&quot;InputPath&quot;: &quot;$.key1&quot;,
&quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:lambda:xx-xxxx-x:XXXXXXXXXXXX:function:Execution&quot;,
&quot;End&quot;: true 
} 
} 
}, 
{ 
&quot;StartAt&quot;: “key32&quot;,
&quot;States&quot;: { 
“key32&quot;: { 
&quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Task&quot;,
&quot;InputPath&quot;: &quot;$.key2&quot;,
&quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:lambda:xx-xxxx-x:XXXXXXXXXXXX:function:Execution&quot;,
&quot;End&quot;: true 
} 
} 
}, 
{ 
&quot;StartAt&quot;: “key33&quot;,
&quot;States&quot;: { 
“key33&quot;: { 
&quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Task&quot;,
&quot;InputPath&quot;: &quot;$.key3&quot;,
&quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:lambda:xx-xxxx-x:XXXXXXXXXXXX:function:Execution&quot;,
&quot;End&quot;: true 
} 
} 
} 
] 
} </code> 
<p><code class="lang-json"></code></p> 
<p><strong>Step 4: Load data into Amazon Redshift</strong><br /> The second Lambda function in the state machine extracts records from RDS associated with keys retrieved for DynamoDB. It processes the data then loads into an Amazon Redshift table. The following is code snippet for the second Lambda function in Java 8.</p> 
<code class="lang-java">public class LambdaFunctionHandler implements RequestHandler&lt;String, String&gt; {
public static String key = null;
 public String handleRequest(String input, Context context) { 
key=input; 
//1. Getting basic configurations for the next classes + s3 client Properties
config = getConfig(); 
AmazonS3 s3 = AmazonS3ClientBuilder.defaultClient(); 
// 2. Export query results from RDS into S3 bucket 
new RdsDataService(config).exportDataToS3(s3,key); 
// 3. Import query results from S3 bucket into Redshift 
new RedshiftDataService(config).importDataFromS3(s3,key); 
System.out.println(input); 
return &quot;SUCCESS&quot;; 
} 
}</code> 
<p>After the data is loaded into Amazon Redshift, end users can visualize it using their preferred business intelligence tools.</p> 
<h3>Lessons learned</h3> 
<li>At the time of publication, the 1.5–GB memory hard limit for Lambda functions was inadequate for processing our complex workload. Step Functions gave us the flexibility to chunk our large datasets and process them in parallel, saving on costs and time.</li> 
<li>In our previous implementation, we assigned each key a dedicated Lambda function along with CloudWatch rules for schedule automation. This approach proved to be inefficient and quickly became an operational burden. Previously, we processed each key sequentially, with each key adding about five minutes to the overall processing time. For example, processing three keys meant that the total processing time was three times longer. With Step Functions, the entire state machine executes in about five minutes.</li> 
<li>Using DynamoDB with Step Functions gave us the flexibility to manage keys efficiently. In our previous implementations, keys were hardcoded in Lambda functions, which became difficult to manage due to frequent updates. DynamoDB is a great way to store dynamic data that changes frequently, and it works perfectly with our serverless architectures.</li> 
<b>Conclusion</b> 
<p>With Step Functions, we were able to fully automate the frequent configuration updates to our dataset resulting in significant cost savings, reduced risk to data errors due to system downtime, and more time for us to focus on new product development rather than support related issues. We hope that you have found the information useful and that it can serve as a jump-start to building your own ETL processes on AWS with managed AWS services.</p>

<p><em>This post courtesy of Ryan Green, Software Development Engineer, AWS Serverless</em></p> 
<p>The concepts of <a href="https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/AWS_Blue_Green_Deployments.pdf">blue/green</a> and canary deployments have been around for a while now and have been well-established as best-practices for reducing the risk of software deployments.</p> 
<p>In a traditional, horizontally scaled application, copies of the application code are deployed to multiple nodes (instances, containers, on-premises servers, etc.), typically behind a load balancer. In these applications, deploying new versions of software to too many nodes at the same time can impact application availability as there may not be enough healthy nodes to service requests during the deployment. This aggressive approach to deployments also drastically increases the blast radius of software bugs introduced in the new version and does not typically give adequate time to safely assess the quality of the new version against production traffic.</p> 
<p>In such applications, one commonly accepted solution to these problems is to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployment-configurations.html">slowly and incrementally</a> roll out application software across the nodes in the fleet while simultaneously verifying application health (canary deployments). Another solution is to stand up an entirely different fleet and weight (or flip) traffic over to the new fleet after verification, ideally with some production traffic (blue/green). Some teams deploy to a single host (“one box environment”), where the new release can bake for some time before promotion to the rest of the fleet. Techniques like this enable the maintainers of complex systems to safely test in production while minimizing customer impact.</p> 
<b>Enter Serverless</b> 
<p>There is somewhat of an impedance mismatch when mapping these concepts to a serverless world. You can’t incrementally deploy your software across a fleet of servers when there are no servers!* In fact, even the term “deployment” takes on a different meaning with functions as a service (FaaS). In <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda">AWS Lambda</a>, a “deployment” can be roughly modeled as a call to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/create-function.html">CreateFunction</a>, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/update-function-code.html">UpdateFunctionCode</a>, or <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/update-alias.html">UpdateAlias</a> (I won’t get into the semantics of whether updating configuration counts as a deployment), all of which may affect the version of code that is invoked by clients.</p> 
<p>The abstractions provided by Lambda remove the need for developers to be concerned about servers and Availability Zones, and this provides a powerful opportunity to greatly simplify the process of deploying software.<br /> <em>*Of course there are servers, but they are abstracted away from the developer.</em></p> 
<b>Traffic shifting with Lambda aliases</b> 
<p>Before the release of <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-traffic-shifting-using-aliases.html">traffic shifting for Lambda aliases</a>, deployments of a Lambda function could only be performed in a single “flip” by updating function code for version $LATEST, or by updating an alias to target a different function version. After the update propagates, typically within a few seconds, 100% of function invocations execute the new version. Implementing canary deployments with this model required the development of an additional routing layer, further adding development time, complexity, and invocation latency.<br /> While rolling back a bad deployment of a Lambda function is a trivial operation and takes effect near instantaneously, deployments of new versions for critical functions can still be a potentially nerve-racking experience.</p> 
<p>With the introduction of alias traffic shifting, it is now possible to trivially implement canary deployments of Lambda functions. By updating additional version weights on an alias, invocation traffic is routed to the new function versions based on the weight specified. Detailed <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/working_with_metrics.html">CloudWatch metric</a>s for the alias and version can be analyzed during the deployment, or other health checks performed, to ensure that the new version is healthy before proceeding.</p> 
<p>Note: Sometimes the term “canary deployments” refers to the release of software to a subset of users. In the case of alias traffic shifting, the new version is released to some percentage of all users. It’s not possible to shard based on identity without adding an additional routing layer.</p> 
<h3>Examples</h3> 
<p>The simplest possible use of a canary deployment looks like the following:</p> 
<code># Update $LATEST version of function
aws lambda update-function-code --function-name myfunction ….
# Publish new version of function
aws lambda publish-version --function-name myfunction
# Point alias to new version, weighted at 5% (original version at 95% of traffic)
aws lambda update-alias --function-name myfunction --name myalias --routing-config '{&quot;AdditionalVersionWeights&quot; : {&quot;2&quot; : 0.05} }'
# Verify that the new version is healthy
…
# Set the primary version on the alias to the new version and reset the additional versions (100% weighted)
aws lambda update-alias --function-name myfunction --name myalias --function-version 2 --routing-config '{}'
</code> 
<p>This is begging to be automated! Here are a few options.</p> 
<h3>Simple deployment automation</h3> 
<p>This simple Python script runs as a Lambda function and deploys another function (how meta!) by incrementally increasing the weight of the new function version over a prescribed number of steps, while checking the health of the new version. If the health check fails, the alias is rolled back to its initial version. The health check is implemented as a simple check against the existence of Errors metrics in CloudWatch for the alias and new version.</p>

</code> 
<p><strong>Description of input parameters</strong></p> 
<li><strong>function-name</strong>: The name of the Lambda function to deploy</li> 
<li><strong>alias-name</strong>: The name of the alias used to invoke the Lambda function</li> 
<li><strong>new-version</strong>: The version identifier for the new version to deploy</li> 
<li><strong>steps</strong>: The number of times the new version weight is increased</li> 
<li><strong>interval</strong>: The amount of time (in seconds) to wait between weight updates</li> 
<li><strong>type</strong>: The function to use to generate the weights. Supported values: “linear”</li> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/11/30/invocation-alias-count.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/11/30/invocation-alias-count.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Because this runs as a Lambda function, it is subject to the maximum timeout of 5 minutes. This may be acceptable for many use cases, but to achieve a slower rollout of the new version, a different solution is required.</p> 
<h3>Step Functions workflow</h3> 
<p>This <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-deploy/blob/master/template.yml#L119">state machine</a> performs essentially the same task as the simple deployment function, but it runs as an asynchronous workflow in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions">AWS Step Functions</a>. A nice property of Step Functions is that the maximum deployment timeout has now increased from 5 minutes to 1 year!</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/11/30/step-function-lambda-aliases-workflow.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/11/30/step-function-lambda-aliases-workflow.png" /></a></p> 
<p>The step function incrementally updates the new version weight based on the steps parameter, waiting for some time based on the interval parameter, and performing health checks between updates. If the health check fails, the alias is rolled back to the original version and the workflow fails.</p> 
<p>For example, to execute the workflow:</p> 
<code>export STATE_MACHINE_ARN=`aws cloudformation describe-stack-resources --stack-name aws-lambda-deploy-stack --logical-resource-id DeployStateMachine --output text | cut&nbsp; -d$'\t' -f3`
aws stepfunctions start-execution --state-machine-arn $STATE_MACHINE_ARN --input '{
&quot;function-name&quot;: &quot;MyFunction&quot;,
&quot;alias-name&quot;: &quot;MyAlias&quot;,
&quot;new-version&quot;: &quot;2&quot;,
&quot;steps&quot;: 10,
&quot;interval&quot;: 120,
&quot;type&quot;: &quot;linear&quot;}'
</code> 
<h3>Getting feedback on the deployment</h3> 
<p>Because the state machine runs asynchronously, retrieving feedback on the deployment requires polling for the execution status using <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/apireference/API_DescribeExecution.html">DescribeExecution</a> or implementing an asynchronous notification (using SNS or email, for example) from the Rollback or Finalize functions. A <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html">CloudWatch alarm</a> could also be created to alarm based on the “ExecutionsFailed” metric for the state machine.</p> 
<h3>A note on health checks and observability</h3> 
<p>Weighted rollouts like this are considerably more successful if the code is being exercised and monitored continuously. In this example, it would help to have some automation continuously invoking the alias and reporting metrics on these invocations, such as client-side success rates and latencies.</p> 
<p>The absence of Lambda Errors metrics used in these examples can be misleading if the function is not getting invoked. It’s also recommended to instrument your Lambda functions with custom metrics, in addition to Lambda’s built-in metrics, that can be used to monitor health during deployments.</p> 
<b>Extensibility</b> 
<p>These examples could be easily extended in various ways to support different use cases. For example:</p> 
<li><strong>Health check implementations</strong>: CloudWatch alarms, automatic invocations with payload assertions, querying external systems, etc.</li> 
<li><strong>Weight increase functions</strong>: Exponential, geometric progression, single canary step, etc.</li> 
<li><strong>Custom success/failure notifications</strong>: SNS, email, CI/CD systems, service discovery systems, etc.</li> 
<b>Traffic shifting with SAM and CodeDeploy</b> 
<p>Using the Lambda <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lambda/update-alias.html">UpdateAlias</a> operation with additional version weights provides a powerful primitive for you to implement custom traffic shifting solutions for Lambda functions.</p> 
<p>For those not interested in building custom deployment solutions, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/">AWS CodeDeploy</a> provides an intuitive turn-key implementation of this functionality integrated directly into the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model">Serverless Application Model</a>. Traffic-shifted deployments can be declared in a SAM template, and CodeDeploy manages the function rollout as part of the CloudFormation stack update. CloudWatch alarms can also be configured to trigger a stack rollback if something goes wrong.</p> 
<p>i.e.</p> 
<code>MyFunction:
Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
Properties:
FunctionName: MyFunction
AutoPublishAlias: MyFunctionInvokeAlias

<p>For more information about using CodeDeploy with SAM, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/automating-updates-to-serverless-apps.html">Automating Updates to Serverless Apps</a>.</p> 
<b>Conclusion</b> 
<p>It is often the simple features that provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">the most value</a>. As I demonstrated in this post, serverless architectures allow the complex deployment orchestration used in traditional applications to be replaced with a simple Lambda function or Step Functions workflow. By allowing invocation traffic to be easily weighted to multiple function versions, Lambda alias traffic shifting provides a simple but powerful feature that I hope empowers you to easily implement safe deployment workflows for your Lambda functions.</p>
