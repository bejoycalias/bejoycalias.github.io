<h5>This post courtesy of Josh Kahn, AWS Solutions Architect</h5> 
<p>Message brokers can be used to solve a number of needs in enterprise architectures, including managing workload queues and broadcasting messages to a number of subscribers. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/">Amazon MQ</a> is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers in the cloud.</p> 
<p>In this post, I discuss one approach to invoking <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> from queues and topics managed by Amazon MQ brokers. This and other similar patterns can be useful in integrating legacy systems with serverless architectures. You could also integrate systems already migrated to the cloud that use common APIs such as JMS.</p> 
<p>For example, imagine that you work for a company that produces training videos and which recently migrated its video management system to AWS. The on-premises system used to publish a message to an ActiveMQ broker when a video was ready for processing by an on-premises transcoder. However, on AWS, your company uses <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/">Amazon Elastic Transcoder</a>. Instead of modifying the management system, Lambda polls the broker for new messages and starts a new Elastic Transcoder job. This approach avoids changes to the existing application while refactoring the workload to leverage cloud-native components.</p> 
<p>This solution uses <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/WhatIsCloudWatchEvents.html">Amazon CloudWatch Events</a> to trigger a Lambda function that polls the Amazon MQ broker for messages. Instead of starting an Elastic Transcoder job, the sample writes the received message to an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a> table with a time stamp indicating the time received.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/30/reference_diagram_resized.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/30/reference_diagram_resized.png" /></a></p> 
<b>Getting started</b> 
<p>To start, navigate to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/home">Amazon MQ console</a>. Next, launch a new Amazon MQ instance, selecting <strong>Single-instance Broker</strong> and supplying a broker name, user name, and password. Be sure to document the user name and password for later.</p> 
<p>For the purposes of this sample, choose the default options in the <strong>Advanced settings</strong> section. Your new broker is deployed to the default VPC in the selected AWS Region with the default security group. For this post, you update the security group to allow access for your sample Lambda function. In a production scenario, I recommend deploying both the Lambda function and your Amazon MQ broker in your own VPC.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/29/Picture1-1.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/29/Picture1-1.png" /></a></p> 
<p>After several minutes, your instance changes status from “Creation Pending” to “Available.” You can then visit the Details page of your broker to retrieve connection information, including a link to the ActiveMQ web console where you can monitor the status of your broker, publish test messages, and so on. In this example, use the Stomp protocol to connect to your broker. Be sure to capture the broker host name, for example:</p> 
<p>&lt;BROKER_ID&gt;.mq.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/29/Picture2-1.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/29/Picture2-1.png" /></a></p> 
<p>You should also modify the Security Group for the broker by clicking on its Security Group ID. Click the<strong> Edit</strong> button and then click <strong>Add Rule</strong> to allow inbound traffic on port 8162 for your IP address.</p>

<p>To simplify the deployment of this example, I’ve provided an <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model">AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)</a> template that deploys the sample function and DynamoDB table, and schedules the function to be invoked every five minutes. Detailed instructions can be found with sample code on GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/amazonmq-invoke-aws-lambda">amazonmq-invoke-aws-lambda repository</a>, with sample code. I discuss a few key aspects in this post.</p> 
<p>First, SAM makes it easy to deploy and schedule invocation of our function:</p> 
<code class="lang-yaml"></code> 
<code class="lang-yaml">SubscriberFunction:
Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
Properties:
CodeUri: subscriber/
Handler: index.handler
Runtime: nodejs6.10
Role: !GetAtt SubscriberFunctionRole.Arn
Timeout: 15
Environment:
Variables:
HOST: !Ref AmazonMQHost
LOGIN: !Ref AmazonMQLogin
PASSWORD: !Ref AmazonMQPassword
QUEUE_NAME: !Ref AmazonMQQueueName
WORKER_FUNCTIOn: !Ref WorkerFunction
Events:
Timer:
Type: Schedule
Properties:
Schedule: rate(5 minutes)
WorkerFunction:
Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
Properties:
CodeUri: worker/
Handler: index.handler
Runtime: nodejs6.10
Role: !GetAtt WorkerFunctionRole.Arn
Environment:
Variables:
TABLE_NAME: !Ref MessagesTable</code> 
<p>In the code, you include the URI, user name, and password for your newly created Amazon MQ broker. These allow the function to poll the broker for new messages on the sample queue.</p> 
<p>The sample Lambda function is written in Node.js, but <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/cross-language-clients.html">clients exist for a number of programming languages</a>.</p> 
<code class="lang-js">stomp.connect(options, (error, client) =&gt; {
if (error) { /* do something */ }
let headers = {
destination: ‘/queue/SAMPLE_QUEUE’,
ack: ‘auto’
}
client.subscribe(headers, (error, message) =&gt; {
if (error) { /* do something */ }
message.readString(‘utf-8’, (error, body) =&gt; {
if (error) { /* do something */ }
let params = {
FunctionName: MyWorkerFunction,
Payload: JSON.stringify({
message: body,
timestamp: Date.now()
})
}
let lambda = new AWS.Lambda()
lambda.invoke(params, (error, data) =&gt; {
if (error) { /* do something */ }
})
}
})
})</code> 
<code class="lang- node.js"></code> 
<b>Sending a sample message</b> 
<p>For the purpose of this example, use the Amazon MQ console to send a test message. Navigate to the details page for your broker.</p> 
<p>About midway down the page, choose <strong>ActiveMQ Web Console</strong>. Next, choose <strong>Manage ActiveMQ Broker</strong> to launch the admin console. When you are prompted for a user name and password, use the credentials created earlier.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/29/Picture4-1.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/29/Picture4-1.png" /></a></p> 
<p>At the top of the page, choose <strong>Send</strong>. From here, you can send a sample message from the broker to subscribers. For this example, this is how you generate traffic to test the end-to-end system. Be sure to set the <strong>Destination</strong> value to “SAMPLE_QUEUE.” The message body can contain any text. Choose <strong>Send</strong>.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/29/Picture5-1.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/29/Picture5-1.png" /></a></p> 
<p>You now have a Lambda function polling for messages on the broker. To verify that your function is working, you can confirm in the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/home">DynamoDB console</a> that the message was successfully received and processed by the sample Lambda function.</p> 
<p>First, choose <strong>Tables</strong> on the left and select the table name “amazonmq-messages” in the middle section. With the table detail in view, choose <strong>Items</strong>. If the function was successful, you’ll find a new entry similar to the following:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/29/DynamoDB_Table2.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/29/DynamoDB_Table2-1024x77.png" /></a></p> 
<p>If there is no message in DynamoDB, check again in a few minutes or review the CloudWatch Logs group for Lambda functions that contain debug messages.</p> 
<b>Alternative approaches</b> 
<p>Beyond the approach described here, you may consider other approaches as well. For example, you could use an intermediary system such as Apache Flume to pass messages from the broker to Lambda or deploy <a href="http://camel.apache.org/http.html">Apache Camel to trigger Lambda via a POST to API Gateway</a>. There are trade-offs to each of these approaches. My goal in using CloudWatch Events was to introduce an easily repeatable pattern familiar to many Lambda developers.</p> 
<b>Summary</b> 
<p>I hope that you have found this example of how to integrate AWS Lambda with Amazon MQ useful. If you have expertise or legacy systems that leverage APIs such as JMS, you may find this useful as you incorporate serverless concepts in your enterprise architectures.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">AWS Fargate</a> is a technology that allows you to focus on running your application without needing to provision, monitor, or manage the underlying compute infrastructure. You package your application into a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-are-containers/">Docker container</a> that you can then launch using your container orchestration tool of choice.</p> 
<p>Fargate allows you to use containers without being responsible for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> instances, similar to how EC2 allows you to run VMs without managing physical infrastructure. Currently, Fargate provides support for Amazon Elastic Container Service (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs">Amazon ECS</a>). Support for Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks">Amazon EKS</a>) will be made available in the near future.</p> 
<p>Despite offloading the responsibility for the underlying instances, Fargate still gives you deep control over configuration of network placement and policies. This includes the ability to use many networking fundamentals such as Amazon VPC and security groups.</p> 
<p>This post covers how to take advantage of the different ways of networking your containers in Fargate when using ECS as your orchestration platform, with a focus on how to do networking securely.</p> 
<p>The first step to running any application in Fargate is defining an ECS task for Fargate to launch. A task is a logical group of one or more Docker containers that are deployed with specified settings. When running a task in Fargate, there are two different forms of networking to consider:</p> 
<li>Container (local) networking</li> 
<li>External networking</li> 
<b>Container Networking</b> 
<p>Container networking is often used for tightly coupled application components. Perhaps your application has a web tier that is responsible for serving static content as well as generating some dynamic HTML pages. To generate these dynamic pages, it has to fetch information from another application component that has an HTTP API.</p> 
<p>One potential architecture for such an application is to deploy the web tier and the API tier together as a pair and use local networking so the web tier can fetch information from the API tier.</p> 
<p>If you are running these two components as two processes on a single EC2 instance, the web tier application process could communicate with the API process on the same machine by using the local loopback interface. The local loopback interface has a special IP address of 127.0.0.1 and hostname of localhost.</p> 
<p>By making a networking request to this local interface, it bypasses the network interface hardware and instead the operating system just routes network calls from one process to the other directly. This gives the web tier a fast and efficient way to fetch information from the API tier with almost no networking latency.</p> 
<p>In Fargate, when you launch multiple containers as part of a single task, they can also communicate with each other over the local loopback interface. Fargate uses a special container networking mode called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-cloud-native-networking-for-ecs-containers/">awsvpc</a>, which gives all the containers in a task a shared elastic network interface to use for communication.</p> 
<p>If you specify a port mapping for each container in the task, then the containers can communicate with each other on that port. For example the following task definition could be used to deploy the web tier and the API tier:</p> 
<code class="lang-json">{
&quot;family&quot;: &quot;myapp&quot;
&quot;containerDefinitions&quot;: [
{
&quot;name&quot;: &quot;web&quot;,
&quot;image&quot;: &quot;my web image url&quot;,
&quot;portMappings&quot;: [
{
&quot;containerPort&quot;: 80
}
],
&quot;memory&quot;: 500,
&quot;cpu&quot;: 10,
&quot;esssential&quot;: true
},
{
&quot;name&quot;: &quot;api&quot;,
&quot;image&quot;: &quot;my api image url&quot;,
&quot;portMappings&quot;: [
{
&quot;containerPort&quot;: 8080
}
],
&quot;cpu&quot;: 10,
&quot;memory&quot;: 500,
&quot;essential&quot;: true
}
]
}</code> 
<p>ECS, with Fargate, is able to take this definition and launch two containers, each of which is bound to a specific static port on the elastic network interface for the task.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/26/Slide1.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/26/Slide1-1024x592.png" /></a>Because each Fargate task has its own isolated networking stack, there is no need for dynamic ports to avoid port conflicts between different tasks as in other networking modes. The static ports make it easy for containers to communicate with each other. For example, the web container makes a request to the API container using its well-known static port:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">curl 127.0.0.1:8080/my-endpoint</code> 
<p>This sends a local network request, which goes directly from one container to the other over the local loopback interface without traversing the network. This deployment strategy allows for fast and efficient communication between two tightly coupled containers. But most application architectures require more than just internal local networking.</p> 
<b>External Networking</b> 
<p>External networking is used for network communications that go outside the task to other servers that are not part of the task, or network communications that originate from other hosts on the internet and are directed to the task.</p> 
<p>Configuring external networking for a task is done by modifying the settings of the VPC in which you launch your tasks. A VPC is a fundamental tool in AWS for controlling the networking capabilities of resources that you launch on your account.</p> 
<p>When setting up a VPC, you create one or more subnets, which are logical groups that your resources can be placed into. Each subnet has an Availability Zone and its own route table, which defines rules about how network traffic operates for that subnet. There are two main types of subnets: public and private.</p> 
<h3>Public subnets</h3> 
<p>A public subnet is a subnet that has an associated internet gateway. Fargate tasks in that subnet are assigned both private and public IP addresses:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/26/Slide2.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/26/Slide2-1024x866.png" /></a><br /> A browser or other client on the internet can send network traffic to the task via the internet gateway using its public IP address. The tasks can also send network traffic to other servers on the internet because the route table can route traffic out via the internet gateway.</p> 
<p>If tasks want to communicate directly with each other, they can use each other’s private IP address to send traffic directly from one to the other so that it stays inside the subnet without going out to the internet gateway and back in.</p> 
<h3>Private subnets</h3> 
<p>A private subnet does not have direct internet access. The Fargate tasks inside the subnet don’t have public IP addresses, only private IP addresses. Instead of an internet gateway, a network address translation (NAT) gateway is attached to the subnet:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/26/Slide4.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/26/Slide4-1024x493.png" /></a></p> 
<p>There is no way for another server or client on the internet to reach your tasks directly, because they don’t even have an address or a direct route to reach them. This is a great way to add another layer of protection for internal tasks that handle sensitive data. Those tasks are protected and can’t receive any inbound traffic at all.</p> 
<p>In this configuration, the tasks can still communicate to other servers on the internet via the NAT gateway. They would appear to have the IP address of the NAT gateway to the recipient of the communication. If you run a Fargate task in a private subnet, you must add this NAT gateway. Otherwise, Fargate can’t make a network request to Amazon ECR to download the container image, or communicate with Amazon CloudWatch to store container metrics.</p> 
<b>Load balancers</b> 
<p>If you are running a container that is hosting internet content in a private subnet, you need a way for traffic from the public to reach the container. This is generally accomplished by using a load balancer such as an Application Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer.</p> 
<p>ECS integrates tightly with AWS load balancers by automatically configuring a service-linked load balancer to send network traffic to containers that are part of the service. When each task starts, the IP address of its elastic network interface is added to the load balancer’s configuration. When the task is being shut down, network traffic is safely drained from the task before removal from the load balancer.</p> 
<p>To get internet traffic to containers using a load balancer, the load balancer is placed into a public subnet. ECS configures the load balancer to forward traffic to the container tasks in the private subnet:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/26/Slide5.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/26/Slide5-1024x647.png" /></a></p> 
<p>This configuration allows your tasks in Fargate to be safely isolated from the rest of the internet. They can still initiate network communication with external resources via the NAT gateway, and still receive traffic from the public via the Application Load Balancer that is in the public subnet.</p> 
<p>Another potential use case for a load balancer is for internal communication from one service to another service within the private subnet. This is typically used for a microservice deployment, in which one service such as an internet user account service needs to communicate with an internal service such as a password service. Obviously, it is undesirable for the password service to be directly accessible on the internet, so using an internet load balancer would be a major security vulnerability. Instead, this can be accomplished by hosting an internal load balancer within the private subnet:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/26/Slide6.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/26/Slide6-1024x552.png" /></a></p> 
<p>With this approach, one container can distribute requests across an Auto Scaling group of other private containers via the internal load balancer, ensuring that the network traffic stays safely protected within the private subnet.</p> 
<b>Best Practices for Fargate Networking</b> 
<h4><strong>Determine whether you should use local task networking</strong></h4> 
<p>Local task networking is ideal for communicating between containers that are tightly coupled and require maximum networking performance between them. However, when you deploy one or more containers as part of the same task they are always deployed together so it removes the ability to independently scale different types of workload up and down.</p> 
<p>In the example of the application with a web tier and an API tier, it may be the case that powering the application requires only two web tier containers but 10 API tier containers. If local container networking is used between these two container types, then an extra eight unnecessary web tier containers would end up being run instead of allowing the two different services to scale independently.</p> 
<p>A better approach would be to deploy the two containers as two different services, each with its own load balancer. This allows clients to communicate with the two web containers via the web service’s load balancer. The web service could distribute requests across the eight backend API containers via the API service’s load balancer.</p> 
<h4><strong>Run internet tasks that require internet access in a public subnet</strong></h4> 
<p>If you have tasks that require internet access and a lot of bandwidth for communication with other services, it is best to run them in a public subnet. Give them public IP addresses so that each task can communicate with other services directly.</p> 
<p>If you run these tasks in a private subnet, then all their outbound traffic has to go through an NAT gateway. AWS NAT gateways support up to 10 Gbps of burst bandwidth. If your bandwidth requirements go over this, then all task networking starts to get throttled. To avoid this, you could distribute the tasks across multiple private subnets, each with their own NAT gateway. It can be easier to just place the tasks into a public subnet, if possible.</p> 
<h4><strong>Avoid using a public subnet or public IP addresses for private, internal tasks</strong></h4> 
<p>If you are running a service that handles private, internal information, you should not put it into a public subnet or use a public IP address. For example, imagine that you have one task, which is an API gateway for authentication and access control. You have another background worker task that handles sensitive information.</p> 
<p>The intended access pattern is that requests from the public go to the API gateway, which then proxies request to the background task only if the request is from an authenticated user. If the background task is in a public subnet and has a public IP address, then it could be possible for an attacker to bypass the API gateway entirely. They could communicate directly to the background task using its public IP address, without being authenticated.</p> 
<b>Conclusion</b> 
<p>Fargate gives you a way to run containerized tasks directly without managing any EC2 instances, but you still have full control over how you want networking to work. You can set up containers to talk to each other over the local network interface for maximum speed and efficiency. For running workloads that require privacy and security, use a private subnet with public internet access locked down. Or, for simplicity with an internet workload, you can just use a public subnet and give your containers a public IP address.</p>

<p>So, what’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)</a>? ECS is a managed service for running containers on AWS, designed to make it easy to run applications in the cloud without worrying about configuring the environment for your code to run in. Using ECS, you can easily deploy containers to host a simple website or run complex distributed microservices using thousands of containers.</p> 
<p>Getting started with ECS isn’t too difficult. To fully understand how it works and how you can use it, it helps to understand the basic building blocks of ECS and how they fit together!</p> 
<b style="font-size: 2.4rem;color: #153655;margin-bottom: -.6em">Amazon EC2 building blocks</b> 
<p>We currently provide two launch types: EC2 and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">Fargate</a>. With Fargate, the&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2">Amazon EC2</a>&nbsp;instances are abstracted away and managed for you. Instead of worrying about ECS container instances, you can just worry about tasks. In this post, the infrastructure components used by ECS that&nbsp;are&nbsp;handled by Fargate are marked with a *.</p>

<b style="color: #153655;margin-bottom: -.6em">Instance*</b> 
<p><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Instances.html">EC2 instances</a> are good ol’ virtual machines (VMs). And yes, don’t worry, you can connect to them (via SSH). Because customers have varying needs in memory, storage, and computing power, many different <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html">instance types</a> are offered. Just want to run a small application or try a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">free trial</a>? Try t2.micro. Want to run memory-optimized workloads? R3 and X1 instances are a couple options. There are many more instance types as well, which cater to various use cases.</p> 
<h3 style="color: #153655;margin-bottom: -.6em">AMI*</h3> 
<p>Sorry if you wanted to immediately march forward, but <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instances-and-amis.html">before you create your instance</a>, you need to choose an<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html"> AMI</a>. An AMI stands for Amazon Machine Image. What does that mean? Basically, an AMI provides the information required to launch an instance: root volume, launch permissions, and volume-attachment specifications. You can <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/finding-an-ami.html">find</a> and choose a Linux or Windows AMI provided by AWS, the user community, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace">AWS Marketplace</a> (for example, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06XS8WHGJ">Amazon ECS-Optimized AMI</a>), or you can create your own.</p> 
<b style="color: #153655;margin-bottom: -.6em">Region</b> 
<p>AWS is divided into<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html"> regions</a> that are geographic areas around the world (for now it’s just Earth, but maybe someday…). These regions have semi-evocative names such as us-east-1 (N. Virginia), us-west-2 (Oregon), eu-central-1 (Frankfurt), ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo), etc.</p> 
<p>Each region is designed to be completely isolated from the others, and consists of multiple, distinct data centers. This creates a “blast radius” for failure so that even if an entire region goes down, the others aren’t affected. Like many AWS services, to start using ECS, you first need to decide the region in which to operate. Typically, this is the region nearest to you or your users.</p> 
<b style="color: #153655;margin-bottom: -.6em">Availability Zone</b> 
<p>AWS regions are subdivided into <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html">Availability Zones</a>. A region has at minimum two zones, and up to a handful. Zones are <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">physically isolated from each other</a>, spanning one or more different data centers, but are connected through low-latency, fiber-optic networking, and share some common facilities. EC2 is designed so that the most common failures only affect a single zone to prevent region-wide outages. This means you can achieve high availability in a region by spanning your services across multiple zones and distributing across hosts.</p> 
<b style="font-size: 2.4rem;color: #153655;margin-bottom: -.6em">Amazon ECS building blocks</b> 
<b style="color: #153655;margin-bottom: -.6em"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/23/ecs-ec2-instance-sm.png" /></b> 
<b style="color: #153655;margin-bottom: -.6em">Container</b> 
<p>Well, without <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-are-containers/">containers</a>, ECS wouldn’t exist!</p> 
<p><strong>Are containers virtual machines?</strong><br /> Nope! Virtual machines virtualize the hardware (benefits), while containers virtualize the operating system (even more benefits!). If you look inside a container, you would see that it is made by processes running on the host, and tied together by kernel constructs like namespaces, cgroups, etc. But you don’t need to bother about that level of detail, at least not in this post!</p> 
<p><strong>Why containers?</strong><br /> Containers give you the ability to build, ship, and run your code anywhere!</p> 
<p>Before the cloud, you needed to self-host and therefore had to buy machines in addition to setting up and configuring the operating system (OS), and running your code. In the cloud, with virtualization, you can just skip to setting up the OS and running your code. Containers make the process even easier—you can just run your code.</p> 
<p>Additionally, all of the dependencies travel in a package with the code, which is called an image. This allows containers to be deployed on any host machine. From the outside, it looks like a host is just holding a bunch of containers. They all look the same, in the sense that they are generic enough to be deployed on any host.</p> 
<p>With ECS, you can easily run your containerized code and applications across a managed cluster of EC2 instances.</p> 
<p><strong>Are containers a fairly new technology?</strong><br /> The concept of containerization is not new. Its origins date back to 1979 with the creation of chroot. However, it wasn’t until the early 2000s that containers became a major technology. The most significant milestone to date was the release of <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/docker-basics.html">Docker</a> in 2013, which led to the popularization and widespread adoption of containers.</p> 
<p><strong>What does ECS use?</strong><br /> While other container technologies exist (LXC, rkt, etc.), because of its massive adoption and use by our customers, ECS was designed first to work natively with Docker containers.</p> 
<b style="color: #153655;margin-bottom: -.6em">Container instance*</b> 
<p>Yep, you are back to instances. An instance is just slightly more complex in the ECS realm though. Here, it is an<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_instances.html"> ECS container instance</a> that is an EC2 instance running the agent, has a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/instance_IAM_role.html">specifically defined</a> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UsingIAM.html">IAM policy and role</a>, and has been registered into your cluster.</p> 
<p>And as you probably guessed, in these instances, you are running containers.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> 
<h3 style="color: #153655;margin-bottom: -.6em">AMI*</h3> 
<p>These container instances can use any AMI as long as it has <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container_instance_AMIs.html">the following specifications</a>: a modern Linux distribution with the agent and the Docker Daemon with any Docker runtime dependencies running on it.</p> 
<p>Want it more simplified? Well, AWS created the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html">Amazon ECS-Optimized AMI</a> for just that. Not only does that AMI come preconfigured with all of the previously mentioned specifications, it’s tested and includes the recommended <a href="https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-init">ecs-init</a> upstart process to run and monitor the agent.</p> 
<b style="color: #153655;margin-bottom: -.6em">Cluster</b> 
<p>An <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_clusters.html">ECS cluster</a> is a grouping of (container) instances* (or tasks in Fargate) that lie within a single region, but can span multiple Availability Zones – it’s even a good idea for redundancy. When launching an instance (or tasks in Fargate), unless specified, it registers with the cluster named “default”. If “default” doesn’t exist, it is created. You can also scale and delete your clusters.</p> 
<b style="color: #153655;margin-bottom: -.6em">Agent*</b> 
<p>The<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_agent.html"> Amazon ECS container agent</a> is a <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> program that runs in its own container within each EC2 instance that you use with ECS. (It’s also available open source on <a href="https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-agent">GitHub</a>!) The agent is the intermediary component that takes care of the communication between the scheduler and your instances. Want to register your instance into a cluster? (Why wouldn’t you? A cluster is both a logical boundary and provider of pool of resources!) Then you need to run the agent on it.</p> 
<b style="color: #153655;margin-bottom: -.6em">Task</b> 
<p>When you want to start a container, it has to be part of a task. Therefore, you have to create a task first. Succinctly, tasks are a logical grouping of 1 to <em>N</em> containers that run together on the same instance, with <em>N</em> defined by you, up to 10. Let’s say you want to run a custom blog engine. You could put together a web server, an application server, and an in-memory cache, each in their own container. Together, they form a basic frontend unit.</p> 
<h3 style="color: #153655;margin-bottom: -.6em">Task definition</h3> 
<p>Ah, but you cannot create a task directly. You have to create a<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html"> task definition</a> that tells ECS that “task definition X is composed of this container (and maybe that other container and that other container too!).” It’s kind of like an architectural plan for a city. Some other details it can include are how the containers interact, container CPU and memory constraints, and task permissions using <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM roles</a>.</p> 
<p>Then you can tell ECS, “start one task using task definition X.” It might sound like unnecessary planning at first. As soon as you start to deal with multiple tasks, scaling, upgrades, and other “real life” scenarios, you’ll be glad that you have task definitions to keep track of things!</p> 
<b style="color: #153655;margin-bottom: -.6em">Scheduler*</b> 
<p>So, the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/scheduling_tasks.html">scheduler</a> schedules… sorry, this should be more helpful, huh? The scheduler is part of the “hosted orchestration layer” provided by ECS. Wait a minute, what do I mean by “hosted orchestration”? Simply put, hosted means that it’s operated by ECS on your behalf, without you having to care about it. Your applications are deployed in containers running on your instances, but the managing of tasks is taken care of by ECS. One less thing to worry about!</p> 
<p>Also, the scheduler is the component that decides what (which containers) gets to run where (on which instances), according to a number of constraints. Say that you have a custom blog engine to scale for high availability. You could create a service, which by default, spreads tasks across all zones in the chosen region. And if you want each task to be on a different instance, you can use the <em>distinctInstance</em> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-placement.html">task placement</a> constraint. ECS makes sure that not only this happens, but if a task fails, it starts again.</p> 
<h3 style="color: #153655;margin-bottom: -.6em">Service</h3> 
<p>To ensure that you always have your task running without managing it yourself, you can create a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html">service</a> based on the task that you defined and ECS ensures that it stays running. A service is a special construct that says, “at any given time, I want to make sure that <em>N</em> tasks using task definition X1 are running.” If <em>N</em>=1, it just means “make sure that this task is running, and restart it if needed!” And with <em>N</em>&gt;1, you’re basically scaling your application until you hit <em>N</em>, while also ensuring each task is running.</p> 
<b style="font-size: 2.4rem;color: #153655;margin-bottom: -.6em">So, what now?</b>

<p><em>This post contributed by&nbsp;Sundar Narasiman, Arun Kannan, and Thomas Fuller.</em></p> 
<p>AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/12/amazon-ecs-support-for-windows-server-containers-ga/">recently announced</a> the general availability of Windows container management for Amazon Elastic Container Service (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs">Amazon ECS</a>). Docker containers and Amazon ECS make it easy to run and scale applications on a virtual machine by abstracting the complex cluster management and setup needed.</p> 
<p>Classic .NET applications are developed with .NET Framework 4.7.1 or older and can run only on a Windows platform. These include Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), ASP.NET Web Forms, and an ASP.NET MVC web app or web API.</p> 
<b>Why classic ASP.NET?</b> 
<p>ASP.NET MVC 4.6 and older versions of ASP.NET occupy a significant footprint in the enterprise web application space. As enterprises move towards microservices for new or existing applications, containers are one of the stepping stones for migrating from monolithic to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/microservices">microservices</a> architectures. Additionally, the support for Windows containers in Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, and Visual Studio Tooling support for Docker simplifies the containerization of ASP.NET MVC apps.</p> 
<b>Getting started</b> 
<p>In this post, you pick an ASP.NET 4.6.2 MVC application and get step-by-step instructions for migrating to ECS using Windows containers. The detailed steps, AWS CloudFormation template, Microsoft Visual Studio solution, ECS service definition, and ECS task definition are available in the <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-ecs-windows-aspnet">aws-ecs-windows-aspnet</a> GitHub repository.</p> 
<p>To help you getting started running Windows containers, here is the reference architecture for Windows containers on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/ecs-refarch-cloudformation-windows">ecs-refarch-cloudformation-windows</a>. This reference architecture is the layered CloudFormation stack, in that it calls the other stacks to create the environment. The CloudFormation YAML template in this reference architecture is referenced to create a single JSON CloudFormation stack, which is used in the steps for the migration.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/17/aspdotNet_1.png" /></p> 
<b>Steps for Migration</b> 
<p>The code and templates to implement this migration can be found on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-ecs-windows-aspnet">https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-ecs-windows-aspnet</a>.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Your development environment needs to have the latest version and updates for Visual Studio 2017, Windows 10, and Docker for Windows Stable.<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/17/aspdotNet_2.png" /></li> 
<li>Next, containerize the ASP.NET application and test it locally. The size of Windows container application images is generally larger compared to Linux containers. This is because the base image of the Windows container itself is large in size, typically greater than 9 GB.<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/17/aspdotNet_3.png" /></li> 
<li>After the application is containerized, the container image needs to be pushed to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr">Amazon ECR</a>). Images stored in ECR are compressed to improve pull times and reduce storage costs. In this case, you can see that ECR compresses the image to around 1 GB, for an optimization factor of 90%.<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/17/aspdotNet_4.png" /></li> 
<li>Create a CloudFormation stack using the template in the ‘CloudFormation template’ folder. This creates an ECS service, task definition (referring the containerized ASP.NET application), and other related components mentioned in the ECS reference architecture for Windows containers.<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/17/aspdotNet_5.png" /></li> 
<li>After the stack is created, verify the successful creation of the ECS service, ECS instances, running tasks (with the threshold mentioned in the task definition), and the Application Load Balancer’s successful health check against running containers.<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/17/aspdotNet_6.png" /></li> 
<li>Navigate to the Application Load Balancer URL and see the successful rendering of the containerized ASP.NET MVC app in the browser.</li> 
</ol> 
<b>Key Notes</b> 
<li>Generally, Windows container images occupy large amount of space (in the order of few GBs).</li> 
<li>All the task definition parameters for Linux containers are not available for Windows containers. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/windows_task_definitions.html">Windows Task Definitions</a>.</li> 
<li>An Application Load Balancer can be configured to route requests to one or more ports on each container instance in a cluster. The dynamic port mapping allows you to have multiple tasks from a single service on the same container instance.</li> 
<li>IAM roles for Windows tasks require extra configuration. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/windows_task_IAM_roles.html">Windows IAM Roles for Tasks</a>. For this post, configuration was handled by the CloudFormation template.</li> 
<li>The ECS container agent log file can be accessed for troubleshooting Windows containers: <code class="lang-bash">C:\ProgramData\Amazon\ECS\log\ecs-agent.log</code></li> 
<b>Summary</b> 
<p>In this post, you migrated an ASP.NET MVC application to ECS using Windows containers.</p> 
<p>The logical next step is to automate the activities for migration to ECS and build a fully automated continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for Windows containers. This can be orchestrated by leveraging services such as AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, Amazon ECR, and Amazon ECS. You can learn more about how this is&nbsp;done in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/set-up-a-continuous-delivery-pipeline-for-containers-using-aws-codepipeline-and-amazon-ecs/">Set Up a Continuous Delivery Pipeline for Containers Using AWS CodePipeline and Amazon ECS</a> post.</p>

<p><em>This post contributed by AWS Senior Cloud Infrastructure Architect Anabell St Vincent.</em></p> 
<p>Some systems or applications require Transport Layer Security (TLS) traffic from the client all the way through to the Docker container, without offloading or terminating certificates at a load balancer. Some highly time-sensitive services may require communication over TLS without any decryption and re-encryption in the communication path.</p> 
<p>There are multiple options for this type of implementation on AWS. One option is to use a service discovery tool to implement the requirements, but that creates overhead from an implementation and management perspective. In this post, I examine the option of using Amazon Elastic Container Service (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">Amazon ECS</a>) with a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/09/amazon-ec2-container-service-now-integrated-with-network-load-balancer-to-support-high-throughput-and-direct-tcp-connections-with-containers/">Network Load Balancer</a>.</p> 
<p>Amazon ECS is a highly scalable, high-performance service for running Docker containers on AWS. It is integrated with each of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/">Elastic Load Balancing</a> load balancers offered by AWS:</p> 
<li>The Classic Load Balancer supports application or network level traffic and can be used to pass through the TLS traffic when configured with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-listener-config.html">TCP listeners</a>. This approach limits the number of containers to be deployed by Amazon ECS to one per EC2 host. This approach is only available for the ECS launch type of EC2, not Fargate. This is due to Classic Load Balancer not supporting target groups, so dynamic port mapping can’t be leveraged for this type of implementation.</li> 
<li>The Application Load Balancer functions at the application layer, the layer 7 of Open System Interconnection (OSI) and supports HTTP and HTTPS protocols. By operating at layer 7, the Application Load Balancer is able to route traffic based on the request path in the URL. It can also provide SSL offloading or termination of the SSL certificates for applications, by hosting the SSL certificate. The Application Load Balancer integrates well with ECS by providing the functionality of the target groups for the container instances, which allows for port mapping and targeting container groups. Port mappings allows the containers to run on different ports but still be represented by the one port configured on the ALB as part of the target group of the task.</li> 
<li>The Network Load Balancer, which is a high performance, ultra-low latency load balancer that operates at layer 4. It is designed to handle tens of millions of requests per second while maintaining high throughput at ultra-low latency. Operating at layer 4 networking means that the traffic is passed onto the targets based on the IP addresses and ports as oppose to session information or cookies, as is the case with Application Load Balancers. The Network Load Balancer also supports long-lived TCP connections, which are ideal for WebSocket type of applications . Some applications communicate on TCP protocols rather than solely on HTTP and HTTPS. The Network Load Balancer provides the support to load balance between services that require protocols besides HTTP and HTTPS.</li> 
<p>The Network Load Balancer is the best option for managing secure traffic as it provides support for TCP traffic pass through, without decrypting and then re-encrypting the traffic. Additionally, the Network Load Balancer supports target groups, which means port mapping can be used, as well as configuring the load balancer as part of the task definition for the containers.</p> 
<b>Architecture</b> 
<p>The diagram below shows a high-level architecture with TLS traffic coming from the internet that passes through the VPC to the Network Load Balancer, then to a container without offloading or terminating the certificate in the path.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/17/nlbECS_1.png" /></p> 
<p>In this diagram, there are three containers running in an ECS cluster. The ECS cluster can be either the EC2 or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">Fargate</a> launch type.</p> 
<p>The following diagram shows an architecture that contains two different services deployed in two different ECS clusters.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/17/nlbECS_2-1.png" /></p> 
<p>In this architecture, the containers in each of the clusters can reference the other containers securely via the Network Load Balancer without terminating or offloading the certificates until it reaches the destination container.</p> 
<p>This approach addresses the requirements where containers need to communicate securely whether they are deployed in one VPC, across VPCs, or in separate AWS accounts.</p> 
<p>The following diagram below shows both TLS connections from the internet, as well as connections from within the same cluster.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/17/nlbECS_3-2.png" /></p> 
<p>The above approach is achieved by using the same Network Load Balancer for the cluster to serve two different services. Implement this by using two different <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-target-groups.html">target groups</a> (one for each service) and associating them with the ECS task definition. The containers use the DNS name associated with the Network Load Balancer to access the containers in the other service.</p> 
<b>Summary</b> 
<p>The architectures in this post show how the Network Load Balancer integrates seamlessly with ECS and other AWS services, providing end-to-end TLS communication across services without offloading or terminating the certificates. This gives you the ability to use dynamic ports in ECS containers. It can also handle tens of millions of requests per second while maintaining high throughput at ultra-low latency for applications that require the TCP protocol.</p>

<p><em>This post courtesy of Shane Baldacchino, Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services.</em></p> 
<p>Many customers ask for guidance on migrating end-to-end solutions running on virtual machines over to AWS. This post provides an overview of moving a common WordPress blog running on a virtualized platform to AWS, including re-pointing the DNS records associated to with the website.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/server-migration-service">AWS Server Migration Service</a> (AWS SMS) is an agentless service that makes it easier and faster for you to migrate thousands of on-premises workloads to AWS. AWS SMS allows you to automate, schedule, and track incremental replications of live server volumes, making it easier for you to coordinate large-scale server migrations.</p> 
<b>Walkthrough</b> 
<p>The key elements of this migration process include the following steps:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Establish your AWS environment.</li> 
<li>Replicate your database.</li> 
<li>Download the SMS Connector from the AWS Management Console.</li> 
<li>Configure AWS SMS and Hypervisor permissions.</li> 
<li>Install and configure the SMS Connector appliance.</li> 
<li>Import your virtual machine inventory and create a replication job.</li> 
<li>Launch your Amazon EC2 instance.</li> 
<li>Change your DNS records to resolve the WordPress blog to your EC2 instance.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Before you start, ensure that your source systems OS and hypervisor version are supported by AWS. For more information, see the Server Migration Service FAQ.</p> 
<b>Establish your AWS environment</b> 
<p>For this walkthrough, your WordPress blog is currently running as a two-tier LAMP stack in a corporate data center. You have a frontend running Apache and PHP, plus a backend database running on MySQL. All systems are hosted on a virtualized platform.</p> 
<p>First, establish your AWS environment. If your organization is new to AWS, this may include account or subaccount creation, a new virtual private cloud (VPC), and associated subnets, route tables, internet gateways, and so on. Think of this phase as setting up your software-defined data center. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/getting-started/">Getting Started with Amazon EC2</a>.</p> 
<p>The blog is a two-tier stack, so go with two private subnets. Because you want it to be highly available, use multiple <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-regions-availability-zones">Availability Zones</a>. A zone resides within an AWS Region. Each zone is isolated, but the zones within a region are connected through low-latency links. This allows architects and solution designers to build highly available solutions.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/Screen-Shot-2018-01-15-at-10.11.26-PM.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/Screen-Shot-2018-01-15-at-10.11.26-PM-1024x621.png" /></a></p> 
<b>Replicate your database</b> 
<p>WordPress uses a MySQL relational database. You could continue to manage MySQL and the associated EC2 instances associated with maintaining and scaling a database. For this walkthrough, use this opportunity to migrate to an RDS instance of Amazon Aurora, as it is a MySQL compliant database. Not only is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aurora">Amazon Aurora</a> a high-performant database engine but it frees you up to focus on application development by managing time-consuming database administration tasks, including backups, software patching, monitoring, scaling, and replication.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/Screen-Shot-2018-01-15-at-10.12.56-PM.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/Screen-Shot-2018-01-15-at-10.12.56-PM-1024x641.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dms/">AWS Database Migration Service</a>&nbsp;to migrate your MySQL database to Amazon Aurora easily and securely. After a database migration instance has been instantiated, configure the source and destination endpoints and create a replication task.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/dms-console.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/dms-console-1024x327.png" /></a></p> 
<p>By attaching to the MySQL binlog, you can seed in the current data in the database and also capture all future state changes in near real time. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/sbs/CHAP_MySQL2Aurora.html">Migrating a MySQL-Compatible Database to Amazon Aurora</a>.</p> 
<p>Finally, the task shows that you are replicating current data in your WordPress blog database and future changes from MySQL into Amazon Aurora.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/dms-console-actions.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/dms-console-actions-1024x564.png" /></a></p> 
<b>Download the SMS Connector from the AWS Management Console</b> 
<p>Now, use AWS SMS to migrate your Apache PHP frontend to EC2. AWS SMS is delivered as an appliance for your hypervisor.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/Screen-Shot-2018-01-15-at-10.15.54-PM.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/Screen-Shot-2018-01-15-at-10.15.54-PM-1024x635.png" /></a></p> 
<p>To download the SMS Connector, log in to the console and choose Server Migration Service, Connectors, SMS Connector setup guide.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/connector-setup.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/connector-setup-1024x358.png" /></a></p> 
<b>Configure AWS SMS</b> 
<p>Your hypervisor and AWS SMS will need an appropriate user with sufficient privileges to perform migrations.</p> 
<li>AWS SMS – Use the AWS CLI or the IAM console to create an IAM user with the ServerMigrationConnector policy attached.</li> 
<li>Hypervisor – Follow the specific instructions for your hypervisor in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/server-migration-service/latest/userguide/SMS_setup.html">Getting Started with AWS Server Migration Service</a>.</li> 
<b>Install and configure the SMS Connector appliance</b> 
<p>Launch a new VM based on the SMS Connector that you downloaded. To configure the connector, connect to it via HTTPS. You can obtain the SMS Connector IP address from your hypervisor.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/connector-actions.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/connector-actions-1024x333.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Connect to the SMS Connector via HTTPS. In the example above, the connector IP address is 10.0.0.31. In your browser, enter https://10.0.0.31.</p> 
<p>Configure the connector with the IAM and hypervisor credentials that you created earlier.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/connector-connection.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/connector-connection-1024x548.png" /></a></p> 
<p>After it’s configured, and the associated connectivity and authentication checks have passed, return to the console and view your connector in AWS SMS.</p> 
<p>Import your virtual machine inventory and create a replication job<br /> After validating that the SMS Connector is in a “HEALTHY” state, import your server catalog to AWS SMS. This process can take up to a minute.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/connector-healthy.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/connector-healthy-1024x391.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Select the server to migrate and choose Create replication job. The console guides you through the process. The time that the initial replication task takes to complete is dependent on the available bandwidth and the size of your VM. After the initial seed replication, network bandwidth is minimized as AWS SMS replicates only incremental changes occurring on the VM.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/replication-jobs.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/replication-jobs-1024x290.png" /></a></p> 
<b>Launch your EC2 instance</b> 
<p>When your replication task is complete, the artifact created by AWS SMS is a custom AMI that you can use to deploy an EC2 instance. Follow the usual process to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/launching-instance.html">launch your EC2 instance</a>, noting that you may need to replace any host-based firewalls with security groups and NACLs.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/replication-jobs-status.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/replication-jobs-status-1024x485.png" /></a></p> 
<p>When you create an EC2 instance, ensure that you pick the most suitable <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/?sc_channel=PS&amp;sc_campaign=acquisition_AU&amp;sc_publisher=google&amp;sc_medium=ec2_b&amp;sc_content=sitelink&amp;sc_detail=ec2%20instance&amp;sc_category=ec2&amp;sc_segment=instance_types&amp;sc_matchtype=p&amp;sc_country=AU&amp;s_kwcid=AL!">EC2 instance type</a> and size to match your performance requirements while optimizing for cost.</p> 
<p>While your new EC2 instance is a replica of your on-premises VM, you should always validate that applications are functioning. How you do this differs on an application-by-application basis. You can use a combination of approaches, such as editing a local host file and testing your application, SSH, or Telnet.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/ssh-screenshot.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/ssh-screenshot.png" /></a></p> 
<p>From the RDS console, get your connection string details and update your WordPress configuration file to point to the Amazon Aurora database. As WordPress is expecting a MySQL database and Amazon Aurora is MySQL-compliant, this change of database engine is transparent to WordPress.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/wp-config.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/wp-config.png" /></a></p> 
<b>Change your DNS records to resolve the WordPress blog to your EC2 instance</b> 
<p>You have validated that your WordPress application is running correctly, as you are still receiving changes from your on-premises data center via AWS DMS into your Amazon Aurora database.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/Screen-Shot-2018-01-15-at-10.24.11-PM.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/Screen-Shot-2018-01-15-at-10.24.11-PM-1024x607.png" /></a></p> 
<p>You can now update your DNS zone file using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53">Amazon Route 53</a>. Route 53 can be driven by multiple methods: console, SDK, or AWS CLI.</p> 
<p>For this walkthrough, update your DNS zone file via the AWS CLI. The JSON example shows upserting the A record in your zone to resolve to your EC2 instance.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/json-dns.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/json-dns.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Use the AWS CLI to execute the request and update the record in your zone file.&nbsp; The cut-over period between the original off-cloud location and AWS is defined by the TTL in the SOA (statement of authority) in your DNS zone. During this period, any requests resolving to your off-cloud server that result in database writes are automatically replicated to your Amazon Aurora instance via AWS DMS.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/route53-cli.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/16/route53-cli-1024x331.png" /></a></p> 
<p>You have now successfully migrated your WordPress blog to AWS. Based on the TTL of your DNS zone file, end users slowly resolve the WordPress blog to AWS.</p> 
<p>After you have validated your successful migration, be sure to delete your AWS DMS task and your AWS SMS replication job.</p> 
<b>Summary</b> 
<p>In this post, you moved a WordPress blog to AWS, using AWS SMS and AWS DMS to re-point the associated DNS records.</p> 
<p>Many architectures can be extended to use many of the inherent benefits of AWS, with little effort. For example, by using Amazon CloudWatch metrics to drive Auto Scaling policies, you can use an Application Load Balancer as your frontend. This removes the single point of failure for a single Amazon EC2 instance and ensures that your deployed capacity closely follows customer demand. Think big and get building!</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/01/aws-lambda-supports-go/">Today</a>, we’re excited to announce <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> as a supported language for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda">AWS Lambda</a>.</p> 
<p>As someone who’s done their fair share of Go development (recent projects include <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-local">AWS SAM Local</a> and <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/goformation">GoFormation</a>), this is a release I’ve been looking forward to for a while. I’m going to take this opportunity to walk you through how it works by creating a Go serverless application, and deploying it to Lambda.</p> 
<h3>Prerequisites</h3> 
<p>This post assumes that you already have Go installed and configured on your development machine, as well as a basic understanding of Go development concepts. For more details, see&nbsp;<a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">https://golang.org/doc/install</a>.</p> 
<b>Creating an example Serverless application with Go</b> 
<p>Lambda functions can be triggered by variety of event sources:</p> 
<li>Asynchronous events (such as an object being put in an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a> bucket)</li> 
<li>Streaming events (for example, new data records on an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis">Amazon Kinesis</a> stream)</li> 
<li>Synchronous events (manual invocation, or HTTPS request via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/apigateway">Amazon API Gateway</a>)</li> 
<p>As an example, you’re going to create an application that uses an API Gateway event source to create a simple Hello World RESTful API.&nbsp;The full source code for this example application can be found on GitHub at:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/lambda-go-samples">https://github.com/aws-samples/lambda-go-samples</a>.</p> 
<p>After the application is published, it receives a name via the HTTPS request body, and responds with&nbsp;“Hello &lt;name&gt;.” For example:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">$ curl -XPOST -d &quot;Paul&quot;&nbsp;&quot;https://my-awesome-api.example.com/&quot;
Hello&nbsp;Paul</code> 
<p>To implement this, create a Lambda handler function in Go.</p> 
<p>Import the <a href="http://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go">github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go</a>&nbsp;package, which includes helpful Go definitions for Lambda event sources, as well as the <strong>lambda.Start()</strong> method used to register your handler function.</p> 
<p>Start by creating a new project directory in your <strong>$GOPATH</strong>, and then creating a <strong>main.go</strong> file that contains your Lambda handler function:</p> 
<code class="lang-go">package main
import (
&quot;errors&quot;
&quot;log&quot;
&quot;github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/events&quot;
&quot;github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda&quot;
)
var (
// ErrNameNotProvided is thrown when a name is not provided
ErrNameNotProvided = errors.New(&quot;no name was provided in the HTTP body&quot;)
)
// Handler is your Lambda function handler
// It uses Amazon API Gateway request/responses provided by the aws-lambda-go/events package,
// However you could use other event sources (S3, Kinesis etc), or JSON-decoded primitive types such as 'string'.
func Handler(request events.APIGatewayProxyRequest) (events.APIGatewayProxyResponse, error) {
// stdout and stderr are sent to AWS CloudWatch Logs
log.Printf(&quot;Processing Lambda request %s\n&quot;, request.RequestContext.RequestID)
// If no name is provided in the HTTP request body, throw an error
if len(request.Body) &lt; 1 {
return events.APIGatewayProxyResponse{}, ErrNameNotProvided
}
return events.APIGatewayProxyResponse{
Body: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Hello &quot; + request.Body,
StatusCode: 200,
}, nil
}
func main() {
lambda.Start(Handler)
}
</code> 
<p>The <strong>lambda.Start()</strong> method takes a handler, and talks to an internal Lambda endpoint to pass Invoke requests to the handler. If a&nbsp;handler does not match one of the supported types, the Lambda package responds to new invocations served by an&nbsp;internal endpoint with an error message such as:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">json: cannot unmarshal object into Go value of type int32: UnmarshalTypeError</code> 
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>lambda.Start()</strong>&nbsp;method blocks, and does not return after being called, meaning that it’s suitable to run in your Go application’s main entry point.</p> 
<b>More detail on AWS Lambda function handlers with Go</b> 
<p>A handler function passed to <strong>lambda.Start()</strong> must follow these rules:</p> 
<li>It must be a function.</li> 
<li>The function may take between 0 and 2 arguments. 
<li>If there are two arguments, the first argument must implement <strong>context.Context</strong>.</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li>The function may return between 0 and 2 values. 
<li>If there is one return value, it must implement&nbsp;<strong>error</strong>.</li> 
<li>If there are two return values, the second value must implement&nbsp;<strong>error</strong>.</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<p>The <a href="http://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go">github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go</a>&nbsp;library automatically unmarshals the Lambda event JSON to the argument type used by your handler function. To do this, it uses Go’s standard <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Unmarshal">encoding/json</a>&nbsp;package, so your handler function can use any of the standard types supported for unmarshalling (or custom types containing those):</p> 
<li>bool, for JSON booleans</li> 
<li>float64, for JSON numbers</li> 
<li>string, for JSON strings</li> 
<li>[]interface{}, for JSON arrays</li> 
<li>map[string]interface{}, for JSON objects</li> 
<li>nil, for JSON null</li> 
<p>For example, your Lambda function received a JSON event payload like the following:</p> 
<code class="lang-json">{
&quot;id&quot;:&nbsp;12345,
&quot;value&quot;:&nbsp;&quot;some-value&quot;
}</code> 
<p>It should respond with a JSON response that looks like the following:</p> 
<code class="lang-json">{
&quot;message&quot;:&nbsp;&quot;processed request ID 12345&quot;,
&quot;ok&quot;:&nbsp;true
}</code> 
<p>You could use a Lambda handler function that looks like the following:</p> 
<code class="lang-go">package&nbsp;main
import&nbsp;(
&quot;fmt&quot;
&quot;github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda&quot;
)
type Request struct {
ID &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;float64 `json:&quot;id&quot;`
Value &nbsp; &nbsp; string &nbsp;`json:&quot;value&quot;`
}
type Response struct {
Message string `json:&quot;message&quot;`
Ok &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bool &nbsp; `json:&quot;ok&quot;`
}
func Handler(request Request) (Response, error) {
return Response{
Message: fmt.Sprintf(&quot;Processed request ID %f&quot;, request.ID),
Ok: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;true,
}, nil
}
func main() {
lambda.Start(Handler)
}</code> 
<p>For convenience, the <a href="http://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go">github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go</a>&nbsp;package provides event sources that you can also use in your handler function arguments. It also provides return values for common sources such as S3, Kinesis, Cognito, and the API Gateway event source and response objects that you’re using in the application example.</p> 
<b>Adding unit tests</b> 
<p>To test that the Lambda handler works as expected, create a main_test.go file containing some basic unit tests.</p> 
<code class="lang-go">package main_test
import (
&quot;testing&quot;
main &quot;github.com/aws-samples/lambda-go-samples&quot;
&quot;github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/events&quot;
&quot;github.com/stretchr/testify/assert&quot;
)
func TestHandler(t *testing.T) {
tests := []struct {
request events.APIGatewayProxyRequest
expect &nbsp;string
err &nbsp; &nbsp; error
}{
{
// Test that the handler responds with the correct response
// when a valid name is provided in the HTTP body
request: events.APIGatewayProxyRequest{Body: &quot;Paul&quot;},
expect: &nbsp;&quot;Hello Paul&quot;,
err: &nbsp; &nbsp; nil,
},
{
// Test that the handler responds ErrNameNotProvided
// when no name is provided in the HTTP body
request: events.APIGatewayProxyRequest{Body: &quot;&quot;},
expect: &nbsp;&quot;&quot;,
err: &nbsp; &nbsp; main.ErrNameNotProvided,
},
}
for _, test := range tests {
response, err := main.Handler(test.request) 
assert.IsType(t, test.err, err)
assert.Equal(t, test.expect, response.Body)
}
}
</code> 
<h3>Run your tests:</h3> 
<code class="lang-base">$ go test
PASS
ok &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;github.com/awslabs/lambda-go-example &nbsp; &nbsp;0.041s</code> 
<p><em>Note:&nbsp;To make the unit tests more readable, this example uses a third-party library (https://github.com/stretchr/testify). This allows you to describe the test cases in a more natural format, making them more maintainable for other people who may be working in the code base.</em></p> 
<b>Build and deploy</b> 
<p>As Go is a compiled language, build the application and create a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-go-how-to-create-deployment-package.html">Lambda deployment package</a>. To do this, build a binary that runs on Linux, and zip it up into a deployment package.</p> 
<p>To do this, we need to build a binary that will run on Linux, and ZIP it up into a deployment package.</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">$ GOOS=linux go build -o main
$ zip deployment.zip main</code> 
<p>The binary doesn’t need to be called main, but the name must match the Handler configuration property of the deployed Lambda function.</p> 
<p>The deployment package is now ready to be deployed to Lambda.&nbsp;One deployment method is to use the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS CLI</a>. Provide a valid <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html#lambda-intro-execution-role">Lambda execution role</a> for&nbsp; <strong>–role</strong>.</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">$&nbsp;aws lambda create-function \
--region us-west-1 \
--function-name HelloFunction&nbsp;\
--zip-file fileb://./deployment.zip \
--runtime go1.x \
--tracing-config Mode=Active \
--role arn:aws:iam::&lt;account-id&gt;:role/&lt;role&gt;&nbsp;\
--handler main</code> 
<p>From here, configure the invoking service for your function, in this example API Gateway, to call this function and provide the HTTPS frontend for your API. For more information about how to do this in the API Gateway console, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-api-as-simple-proxy-for-lambda.html#api-gateway-create-api-as-simple-proxy-for-lambda-build">Create an API with Lambda Proxy Integration</a>. You could also do this in the Lambda console by assigning an API Gateway trigger.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/lambda-console1.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/lambda-console1.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Then, configure the trigger:</p> 
<li><strong>API name</strong>: lambda-go</li> 
<li><strong>Deployment stage</strong>: prod</li> 
<li><strong>Security</strong>: open</li> 
<p>This results in an API Gateway endpoint that you can test.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/lambda-console-gateway.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/lambda-console-gateway.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Now, you can use cURL to test your API:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">$ curl -XPOST -d &quot;Paul&quot;&nbsp;https://u7fe6p3v64.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/main
Hello&nbsp;Paul</code> 
<p>Doing this manually is fine and works for testing and exploration. If you were doing this for real, you’d want to automate this process further. The next section shows how to add a CI/CD pipeline to this process to build, test, and deploy your serverless application as you change your code.</p> 
<b>Automating tests and deployments</b> 
<p>Next, configure <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline">AWS CodePipeline</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild">AWS CodeBuild</a> to build your application automatically and run all of the tests. If it passes, deploy your application to Lambda.</p> 
<p>The first thing you need to do is create an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/11/introducing-the-aws-serverless-application-model/">AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)</a> template in your source repository. SAM provides an easy way to deploy Serverless resources, such as Lambda functions, APIs, and other event sources, as well as all of the necessary IAM permissions, etc. You can also include any valid <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation">AWS CloudFormation</a> resources within your SAM template, such as a Kinesis stream, or an&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb">Amazon DynamoDB</a> table. They are deployed alongside your Serverless application.</p> 
<p>Create a file called <strong>template.yml</strong> in your application repository with the following contents:</p> 
<code class="lang-yaml">AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
Resources:
HelloFunction:
Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
Properties:
Handler:&nbsp;main
Runtime: go1.x
Tracing: Active
Events:
GetEvent:
Type: Api
Properties:
Path: /
Method: post</code> 
<p>The above template instructs SAM to deploy a Lambda function (called <strong>HelloFunction</strong> in this case), with the Go runtime (<strong>go1.x</strong>), and also an API configured to pass HTTP POST requests to your Lambda function. The Handler property defines which binary in the deployment package needs to be executed (<strong>main</strong> in this case).</p> 
<p>You’re going to use CodeBuild to run your tests, build your Go application, and package it. You can tell CodeBuild how to do all of this by creating a <strong>buildspec.yml</strong> file in your repository containing the following:</p> 
<code class="lang-yaml">
version: 0.2
env:
variables:
# This S3 bucket is used to store the packaged Lambda deployment bundle.
# Make sure to provide a valid S3 bucket name (it must exist already).
# The CodeBuild IAM role must allow write access to it.
S3_BUCKET: &quot;your-s3-bucket&quot;
PACKAGE: &quot;github.com/aws-samples/lambda-go-samples&quot;
phases:
install:
commands:
# AWS Codebuild Go images use /go for the $GOPATH so copy the
# application source code into that directory structure.
- mkdir -p &quot;/go/src/$(dirname ${PACKAGE})&quot;
- ln -s &quot;${CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR}&quot; &quot;/go/src/${PACKAGE}&quot;
# Print all environment variables (handy for AWS CodeBuild logs)
- env
# Install golint
- go get -u github.com/golang/lint/golint
pre_build:
commands:
# Make sure we're in the project directory within our GOPATH
- cd &quot;/go/src/${PACKAGE}&quot;
# Fetch all dependencies
- go get -t ./...
# Ensure that the code passes all lint tests
- golint -set_exit_status
# Check for common Go problems with 'go vet'
-&nbsp;go vet .
# Run all tests included with the application
- go test .
build:
commands:
# Build the go application
- go build -o main
# Package the application with AWS SAM
- aws cloudformation package --template-file template.yml --s3-bucket ${S3_BUCKET} --output-template-file packaged.yml
artifacts:
files:
- packaged.yml</code> 
<p>This buildspec file does the following:</p> 
<li>Sets up your GOPATH, ready for building</li> 
<li>Runs <a href="https://github.com/golang/lint">golint</a>&nbsp;to make sure that any committed code matches the Go style and formatting specification</li> 
<li>Runs any unit tests present (via <strong>go test</strong>)</li> 
<li>Builds your application binary</li> 
<li>Packages the binary into a&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-go-how-to-create-deployment-package.html">Lambda deployment package</a>&nbsp;and uploads it to S3</li> 
<p>For more details about buildspec files, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html">Build Specification Reference</a> for AWS CodeBuild.</p> 
<p>Your project directory should now contain the following files:</p> 
<code>$ tree
.
├── buildspec.yml &nbsp; &nbsp;(AWS CodeBuild&nbsp;configuration file)
├── main.go &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Our&nbsp;application)
├── main_test.go&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(Unit&nbsp;tests)
└── template.yml &nbsp; &nbsp; (AWS SAM template)
0 directories, 4 files</code> 
<p>You’re now ready to set up your automated pipeline with CodePipeline.</p> 
<h3>Create a new pipeline</h3> 
<p>Get started by navigating to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/">CodePipeline</a> console. You need to give your new pipeline a name, such as HelloService.</p> 
<p>Next, select the source repository in which your application code is located. CodePipeline supports either AWS CodeCommit, GitHub.com, or S3. To use the example GitHub.com repository mentioned earlier in this post, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">fork</a> it into your own GitHub.com account or create a new CodeCommit repository and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/how-to-migrate-repository-existing.html">clone</a> it into there. Do this first before selecting a source location.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline1.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline1.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Tell CodePipeline to use CodeBuild to test, build, and package your application using the buildspec.yml file created earlier:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline-build.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline-build.png" /></a></p> 
<p><strong>Important:</strong>&nbsp;CodeBuild needs read/write access to the S3 bucket referenced in the buildspec.yml file that you wrote. It places the packaged Lambda deployment package into S3 after the tests and build are completed. Make sure that the CodeBuild service role created or provided has the correct IAM permissions. For more information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/writing-iam-policies-how-to-grant-access-to-an-amazon-s3-bucket/">Writing IAM Policies: How to grant access to an Amazon S3 bucket</a>. If you don’t do this, CodeBuild fails.</p> 
<p>Finally, set up the deployment stage of your pipeline. Select <strong>AWS CloudFormation</strong> as the deployment method, and the <strong>Create or replace a change set</strong>&nbsp;mode (as required by SAM). To deploy multiple environments (for example, staging, production), add additional deployment stages to your pipeline after it has been created.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline-deploy.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline-deploy.png" /></a></p> 
<p>After being created, your pipeline takes a few minutes to initialize, and then automatically triggers.&nbsp;You can see the latest commit in your version control system make progress through the build and deploy stages of your pipeline.</p> 
<p>You do not need to configure anything further to automatically run your pipeline on new version control commits. It already automatically triggers, builds, and deploys each time.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline-created.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline-created.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Make one final change to the pipeline, to configure the deployment stage to execute the CloudFormation changeset that it creates. To make this change, choose the <strong>Edit</strong> button on your pipeline, choose the pencil icon on the staging deployment stage, and add a new action:</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline-addaction.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/codepipeline-addaction.png" /></a></p> 
<p>After the action is added, save your pipeline. You can test it by making a small change to your Lambda function, and then committing it back to version control. You can see your pipeline trigger, and the changes get deployed to your staging environment.</p> 
<h3>See it in Action</h3> 
<p>After a successful run of the pipeline has completed, you can navigate to the CloudFormation console to see the deployment details.</p> 
<p>In your case, you have a CloudFormation stack deployed. If you look at the <strong>Resources</strong> tab, you see a table of the AWS resources that have been deployed.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/cloudformation-resources.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/cloudformation-resources.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Choose the <strong>ServerlessRestApi</strong> item link to navigate to the API Gateway console and view the details of your deployed API, including the URL,</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/api-gw-stage-edit.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/api-gw-stage-edit.png" /></a></p> 
<p>You can use cURL to test that your Serverless application is functioning as expected:</p> 
<code>$ curl -XPOST -d &quot;Paul&quot;&nbsp;https://y5fjgtq6dj.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Stage
Hello&nbsp;Paul</code> 
<b>One more thing!</b> 
<p>We are also excited to announce that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/xray/">AWS X-Ray</a>&nbsp;can be enabled in your Lambda runtime to analyze and debug your Go functions written for Lambda. The&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-sdk-go.html">X-Ray SDK for Go</a>&nbsp;works with the Go context of your Lambda function, providing features such as&nbsp;AWS SDK retry visibility&nbsp;and one-line error capture.<br /> <a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/xray-go.png"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/01/15/xray-go.png">annotations and metadata</a>&nbsp;to capture additional information in X-Ray about your function invocations. Moreover, the SDK supports the net/http client package, enabling you to trace requests made to&nbsp;endpoints even if they are not X-Ray enabled.</p> 
<b>Wrapping it up!</b> 
<p>Support for Go has been a much-requested feature in Lambda and we are excited to be able to bring it to you. In this post, you created a basic Go-based API and then went on to create a full continuous integration and delivery pipeline that tests, builds, and deploys your application each time you make a change.</p> 
<p>You can also get started with AWS Lambda Go support through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codestar">AWS CodeStar</a>. AWS CodeStar lets you quickly launch development projects that include a sample application, source control and release automation. With this announcement, AWS CodeStar introduced new project templates for Go running on AWS Lambda. Select one of the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/codestar/home?region=us-east-1#/quickstart">CodeStar Go project templates</a> to get started. CodeStar makes it easy to begin editing your Go project code in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9">AWS Cloud9</a>, an online IDE, with just a few clicks.</p>

<p><em>This post contributed by&nbsp;Abby Fuller</em>,&nbsp;<em>AWS Senior Technical Evangelist</em></p> 
<p>Last week, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/12/aws-codepipeline-adds-support-for-amazon-ecs-and-aws-fargate/">AWS announced support</a> for Amazon Elastic Container Service (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs">ECS</a>) targets (including <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate">AWS Fargate</a>) in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline">AWS CodePipeline</a>. This support makes it easier to create a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-delivery/">continuous delivery</a> pipeline for container-based applications and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/microservices">microservices</a>.</p> 
<p>Building and deploying containerized services&nbsp;manually is slow and prone to errors. Continuous delivery with automated build and test mechanisms helps detect errors early, saves time, and reduces failures, making this a popular model for application deployments. Previously, to automate your container workflows with ECS, you had to build your own solution using AWS CloudFormation. Now, you can integrate CodePipeline and CodeBuild with ECS to automate your workflows in just a few steps.</p> 
<p>A typical continuous delivery workflow with CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and ECS might look something like the following:</p> 
<li>Choosing your source</li> 
<li>Building your project</li> 
<li>Deploying your code</li> 
<p>We also have a continuous deployment reference architecture on <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/ecs-refarch-continuous-deployment">GitHub</a>&nbsp;for this workflow.</p> 
<b>Getting Started</b> 
<p>First, create a new project with CodePipeline and give the project a name, such as “demo”.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/22/1_name_codepipeline-1024x447.png" /></p> 
<p>Next, choose a source location where the code is stored. This could be AWS CodeCommit, GitHub, or Amazon S3. For this example, enter <strong>GitHub</strong> and then give CodePipeline access to the repository.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/22/2_add_source_location_codepipeline-1024x686.png" /></p> 
<p>Next, add a build step. You can import an existing build, such as a Jenkins server URL or CodeBuild project, or create a new step with CodeBuild. If you don’t have an existing build project in CodeBuild, create one from within CodePipeline:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/22/3_provider_codebuild-766x1024.png" /></p> 
<li><strong>Build provider</strong>: AWS CodeBuild</li> 
<li><strong>Configure your project</strong>: Create a new build project</li> 
<li><strong>Environment image</strong>: Use an image managed by AWS CodeBuild</li> 
<li><strong>Operating system</strong>: Ubuntu</li> 
<li><strong>Runtime</strong>: Docker</li> 
<li><strong>Version</strong>: aws/codebuild/docker:1.12.1</li> 
<li><strong>Build specification</strong>: Use the buildspec.yml in the source code root directory</li> 
<p>Now that you’ve created the CodeBuild step, you can use it as an existing project in CodePipeline.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/22/4_add_codebuild_codepipeline-1024x713.png" /></p> 
<p>Next, add a deployment provider. This is where your built code is placed. It can be a number of different options, such as AWS CodeDeploy, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS CloudFormation, or Amazon ECS. For this example, connect to Amazon ECS.</p> 
<p>For CodeBuild to deploy to ECS, you must create an image definition JSON file. This requires adding some instructions to the pre-build, build, and post-build phases of the CodeBuild build process in your <em>buildspec.yml</em> file. For help with creating the image definition file, see Step 1 of the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-cd-pipeline.html">Tutorial: Continuous Deployment with AWS CodePipeline</a>.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/22/5_add_deploy_step_codepipeline-1024x914.png" /></p> 
<li><strong>Deployment provider</strong>: Amazon ECS</li> 
<li><strong>Cluster name</strong>: enter your project name from the build step</li> 
<li><strong>Service name</strong>: web</li> 
<li><strong>Image filename</strong>: enter your image definition filename (“web.json”).</li> 
<p>You are almost done!</p> 
<p>You can now choose an existing IAM service role that CodePipeline can use to access resources in your account, or let CodePipeline create one. For this example, use the wizard, and go with the role that it creates (<code class="lang-bash">AWS-CodePipeline-Service</code>).</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/22/6_add_role_codepipeline-1024x451.png" /></p> 
<p>Finally, review all of your changes, and choose <strong>Create pipeline</strong>.</p> 
<p>After the pipeline is created, you’ll have a model of your entire pipeline where you can view your executions, add different tests, add manual approvals, or release a change.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/12/22/7_review_changes_codepipeline-1024x564.png" /></p> 
<p>You can learn more in the&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html">AWS CodePipeline User Guide</a>.</p> 
<p>Happy automating!</p>

<p>At re:Invent 2014, we announced AWS Lambda, what is now the center of the serverless platform at AWS, and helped ignite the trend of companies building serverless applications.</p> 
<p>This year, at re:Invent 2017, the topic of serverless was everywhere. We were incredibly excited to see the energy from everyone attending&nbsp;7 workshops, 15 chalk talks, 20 skills sessions and 27 breakout sessions. Many of these sessions were repeated due to high demand, so we are happy to summarize and provide links to the recordings and slides of these sessions.</p> 
<p>Over the course of the week leading up to and then the week of re:Invent, we also had over 15 new features and capabilities across a number of serverless services, including AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda@Edge, AWS SAM, and the newly announced AWS Serverless Application Repository!</p> 
<b>AWS Lambda</b> 
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/aws-lambda-doubles-maximum-memory-capacity-for-lambda-functions/">AWS Lambda Doubles Maximum Memory Capacity for Lambda Functions</a> – We’ve doubled the maximum memory that you can configure a function to have available, to 3 GB. With this, comes proportional increases to CPU and networking so that your function gets access to two CPU cores!</li>

<b>AWS re:Invent 2017 sessions</b> 
<p>Coming up with the right mix of talks for an event like this can be quite a challenge. The Product, Marketing, and Developer Advocacy teams for Serverless at AWS spent weeks reading through dozens of talk ideas to boil it down to the final list.</p> 
<p>From feedback at other AWS events and webinars, we knew that customers were looking for talks that focused on concrete examples of solving problems with serverless, how to perform common tasks such as deployment, CI/CD, monitoring, and troubleshooting, and to see customer and partner examples solving real world problems. To that extent we tried to settle on a good mix based on attendee experience and provide a track full of rich content.</p> 
<p>Below are the recordings and slides of breakout sessions from re:Invent 2017. We’ve organized them for those getting started, those who are already beginning to build serverless applications, and the experts out there already running them at scale. Some of the videos and slides haven’t been posted yet, and so we will update this list as they become available.</p>

<p><em>This post contributed by Laura Thomson, Senior Product Manager for Amazon EC2.</em></p> 
<p>As you start planning for the new year, I want to give you a heads up that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2">Amazon EC2</a> is migrating to longer format, 17-character resource IDs. Instances and volumes currently already receive this ID format. Beginning in July 2018, all newly created EC2 resources receive longer IDs as well.</p> 
<p>The switch-over will not impact most customers. However, I wanted to make you aware so that you can schedule time at the beginning of 2018 to test your systems with the longer format. If you have a system that parses or stores resource IDs, you may be affected.</p> 
<p>From January 2018 through the end of June 2018, there will be a transition period, during which you can opt in to receive longer IDs. To make this easy, AWS will provide an option to opt in with one click for all regions, resources, and users. AWS will also provide more granular controls via API operations and console support. More information on the opt-in process will be sent out in January.</p> 
<p>We need to do this given how fast AWS is continuing to grow. We will start to run low on IDs for certain resources within a year or so. In order to enable the long-term, uninterrupted creation of new resources, we need to move to the longer ID format.</p> 
<p>The current format is a resource identifier followed by an eight-character string. The new format is the same resource identifier followed by a 17-character string. For example, your current VPCs have resource identifiers such as “vpc-1234abc0”. Starting July 2018, new VPCs will be assigned an identifier such as “vpc-1234567890abcdef0”. You can continue using the existing eight-character IDs for your existing resources, which won’t change and will continue to be supported. Only new resources will receive the 17-character IDs and only after you opt in to the new format.</p> 
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#longer-ids">Longer EC2, EBS, and Storage Gateway Resource IDs</a>.&nbsp; If you have any questions, contact AWS Support on the community forums and via <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/">AWS Support</a>.</p>
