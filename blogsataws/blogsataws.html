<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2017">Microsoft SQL Server 2017</a> (launched just a few days ago) includes lots of powerful <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2017-features">new features</a> including support for <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/dataplatforminsider/2017/04/20/graph-data-processing-with-sql-server-2017/">graph databases</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/automatic-tuning/automatic-tuning">automatic database tuning</a>, and the ability to create clusterless <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/always-on-availability-groups-interoperability-sql-server">Always On Availability Groups</a>. It can also be run on Linux and in Docker containers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Run on EC2</strong></span><br />
I’m happy to announce that you can now launch EC2 instances that run Windows Server 2016 and four <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/A/7/0/A7049F57-D68B-49A2-941F-322D364342BC/SQL_Server_2017_Editions_Datasheet.pdf">editions</a> (Web, Express, Standard, and Enterprise) of SQL Server 2017. The AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) are available today in all AWS Regions and run on a wide variety of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">EC2 instance types</a>, including the new <strong><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-ec2-instances-with-4-tb-of-memory/">x1e.32xlarge</a></strong> with 128 vCPUs and almost 4 TB of memory.</p>
<p>You can launch these instances from the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a> or through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/" title="">AWS Marketplace</a>. Here’s what they look like in the console:</p>
<p><img class="size-medium aligncenter" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/sql_2017_amis_1.png" width="810" height="657" /></p>
<p>And in AWS Marketplace:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/sql_2017_marketplace_1.png" width="810" height="675" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Licensing Options Galore</strong></span><br />
You have lots of licensing options for SQL Server:</p>
<p><strong>Pay As You Go</strong> – This option works well if you would prefer to avoid buying licenses, are already running an older version of SQL Server, and want to upgrade. You don’t have to deal with true-ups, software compliance audits, or Software Assurance and you don’t need to make a long-term purchase. If you are running the Standard Edition of SQL Server, you also benefit from our recent <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-price-reduction-sql-server-standard-edition-on-ec2/">price reduction</a>, with savings of up to 52%.</p>
<p><strong>License Mobility</strong> – This option lets your use your active Software Assurance agreement to bring your existing licenses to EC2, and allows you to run SQL Server on Windows or Linux instances.</p>
<p><strong>Bring Your Own Licenses</strong> – This option lets you take advantage of your existing license investment while minimizing upgrade costs. You can run SQL Server on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/dedicated-instances/">EC2 Dedicated Instances</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/dedicated-hosts/">EC2 Dedicated Hosts</a>, with the potential to reduce operating costs by licensing SQL Server on a per-core basis. This option allows you to run SQL Server 2017 on EC2 Linux instances (SUSE, RHEL, and Ubuntu are supported) and also supports Docker-based environments running on EC2 Windows and Linux instances. To learn more about these options, read the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup">Installation Guidance for SQL Server on Linux</a> and <a title="undefined" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker" target="null">Run SQL Server 2017 Container Image with Docker</a>.</p>

<p>I often give presentations on Amazon’s culture of innovation, and start out with a slide that features a revealing quote from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ebc_jeff_bezos_invention_quote_1.png" width="800" height="452" /></p>
<p>I love to sit down with our customers and to learn how we have empowered their creativity and to pursue their dreams. Earlier this year I chatted with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wpatrickbrandt/">Patrick Brandt</a> from The <a href="http://www.coca-colacompany.com/">Coca-Cola Company</a> in order to learn how they used <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions" title="">AWS Step Functions</a> and other AWS services to support the <a href="https://us.coca-cola.com/">Coke.com</a> Vending Pass program. This program includes drink rewards earned by purchasing products at vending machines equipped to support mobile payments using the <a href="https://us.coca-cola.com/vending/">Coca-Cola Vending Pass</a>. Participants swipe their NFC-enabled phones to complete an <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> or <a href="https://www.android.com/pay/">Android Pay</a> purchase, identifying themselves to the vending machine and earning credit towards future free vending purchases in the process</p>
<p>After the swipe, a combination of SNS topics and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> functions initiated a pair of calls to some existing backend code to count the vending points and update the participant’s record. Unfortunately, the backend code was slow to react and had some timing dependencies, leading to missing updates that had the potential to confuse Vending Pass participants. The initial solution to this issue was very simple: modify the Lambda code to include a 90 second delay between the two calls. This solved the problem, but ate up process time for no good reason (billing for the use of Lambda functions is based on the duration of the request, in 100 ms intervals).</p>
<p>In order to make their solution more cost-effective, the team turned to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions" title="">AWS Step Functions</a>, building a very simple state machine. As I wrote in an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-step-functions-build-distributed-applications-using-visual-workflows/">earlier blog post</a>, Step Functions coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices at scale, using visual workflows that are easy to build.</p>
<p>Coke built a very simple state machine to simplify their business logic and reduce their costs. Yours can be equally simple, or they can make use of other Step Function features such as sequential and parallel execution and the ability to make decisions and choose alternate states. The Coke state machine looks like this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/coke_step_delay_1.png" width="434" height="371" /></p>
<p>The <strong>FirstState</strong> and the <strong>SecondState</strong> states (<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-task-state.html">Task</a> states) call the appropriate Lambda functions while Step Functions implements the 90 second delay (a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-wait-state.html">Wait</a> state). This modification simplified their logic and reduced their costs. Here’s how it all fits together:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/coke_vending_step_2.png" width="844" height="1275" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>What’s Next</strong></span><br />
This initial success led them to take a closer look at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/">serverless</a> computing and to consider using it for other projects. Patrick told me that they have already seen a boost in productivity and developer happiness. Developers no longer need to wait for servers to be provisioned, and can now (as Jeff says) unleash their creativity and pursue their dreams. They expect to use Step Functions to improve the scalability, functionality, and reliability of their applications, going far beyond the initial use for the Coca-Cola Vending Pass. For example, Coke has built a serverless solution for publishing nutrition information to their food service partners using Lambda, Step Functions, and API Gateway.</p>
<p>Patrick and his team are now experimenting with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai">machine learning and artificial intelligence</a>. They built a prototype application to analyze a stream of photos from Instagram and extract trends in tastes and flavors. The application (built as a quick, one-day prototype) made use of <span title="">Lambda</span>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" title="">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/apigateway" title="">Amazon API Gateway</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/" title="">Amazon Rekognition</a> and was, in Patrick’s words, a “big win and an enabler.”</p>
<p>In order to build serverless applications even more quickly, the development team has created an internal CI/CD reference architecture that builds on the <a href="https://serverless.com/">Serverless Application Framework</a>. The architecture includes a guided tour of Serverless and some boilerplate code to access internal services and assets. Patrick told me that this model allows them to easily scale promising projects from “a guy with a computer” to an entire development team.</p>
<p>Patrick will be on stage at <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a> next to my colleague <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim Bray</a>.

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eng-keong-ek-ong-5a353235/">Eng Keong</a>, Founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.bondlinc.com/">Bondlinc</a>, has long wanted to standardize, improve, and automate the traditional workflows that revolve around bond trading. As a former trader at BNP Paribas and Jefferies &amp; Company, E.K. – as Keong is known – had personally seen how manual processes led to information bottlenecks in over-the-counter practices. This drove him, along with future Bondlinc CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/caldeirav/">Vincent Caldeira</a>, to start a new service that maximizes efficiency, information distribution, and accessibility for both clients and bankers in the bond market.</p>
<p>Currently, bond trading requires banks to spend a significant amount of resources retrieving data from expensive and restricted institutional sources, performing suitability checks, and attaching required documentation before presenting all relevant information to clients – usually by email. Bankers are often overwhelmed by these time-consuming tasks, which means clients don’t always get proper access to time-sensitive bond information and pricing. Bondlinc bridges this gap between banks and clients by providing a variety of solutions, including easy access to basic bond information and analytics, updates of new issues and relevant news, consolidated management of your portfolio, and a chat function between banker and client. By making the bond market much more accessible to clients, Bondlinc is taking private banking to the next level, while improving efficiency of the banks as well.</p>
<p>As a startup running on AWS since inception, Bondlinc has built and operated its SaaS product by leveraging <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?nc2=h_m1">Amazon EC2</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc2=h_m1">Amazon S3</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/?nc2=h_m1">Elastic Load Balancing</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/?nc2=h_m1">Amazon RDS</a> across multiple Availability Zones to provide its customers (namely, financial institutions) a highly available and seamlessly scalable product distribution platform. Bondlinc also makes extensive use of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/?nc2=h_m1">Amazon CloudWatch</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/?nc2=h_m1">AWS CloudTrail</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns/?nc2=h_m1">Amazon SNS</a> to meet the stringent operational monitoring, auditing, compliance, and governance requirements of its customers. Bondlinc is currently experimenting with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lex/?nc2=h_a1">Amazon Lex</a> to build a conversational interface into its mobile application via a chat-bot that provides trading assistance services.</p>

<p>My colleague Sanjay Padhi shared the guest post below in order to recognize an important milestone in the use of EC2 Spot Instances.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffbarr">Jeff</a>;</p>
<hr />
<p>A group of researchers from <a href="http://www.clemson.edu/">Clemson University</a> achieved a remarkable milestone while studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model">topic modeling</a>, an important component of machine learning associated with natural language processing, breaking the record for creating the largest high-performance cluster in the cloud by using more than 1,100,000 vCPUs on Amazon EC2 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">Spot Instances</a> running in a single AWS region. The researchers conducted nearly half a million topic modeling experiments to study how human language is processed by computers. Topic modeling helps in discovering the underlying themes that are present across a collection of documents. Topic models are important because they are used to forecast business trends and help in making policy or funding decisions. These topic models can be run with many different parameters and the goal of the experiments is to explore how these parameters affect the model outputs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>The Experiment</strong></span><br />
Professor <a href="https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~aapon/">Amy Apon</a>, Co-Director of the Complex Systems, Analytics and Visualization Institute at Clemson University with Professor <a href="http://alexherzog.net/">Alexander Herzog</a> and graduate students <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-posey-a4705571/">Brandon Posey</a> and Christopher Gropp in collaboration with members of the AWS team as well as AWS Partner <a href="http://www.omnibond.com/">Omnibond</a> performed the experiments. &nbsp;They used software infrastructure based on <a href="http://www.cloudycluster.com/">CloudyCluster</a> that provisions high performance computing clusters on dynamically allocated AWS resources using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ec2-spot-fleet-api-manage-thousands-of-instances-with-one-request/">Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet</a>. Spot Fleet is a collection of biddable spot instances in EC2 responsible for maintaining a target capacity specified during the request. The <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/">SLURM scheduler</a> was used as an overlay virtual workload manager for the data analytics workflows. The team developed additional provisioning and workflow automation software as shown below for the design and orchestration of the experiments. This setup allowed them to evaluate various topic models on different data sets with massively parallel parameter sweeps on dynamically allocated AWS resources. This framework can easily be used beyond the current study for other scientific applications that use parallel computing.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Ramping to 1.1 Million vCPUs</strong></span><br />
The figure below shows elastic, automatic expansion of resources as a function of time, in the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span> Region. At just after 21:40 (GMT-1) on Aug. 26, 2017, the number of vCPUs utilized was 1,119,196. Clemson researchers also took advantage of the new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-per-second-billing-for-ec2-instances-and-ebs-volumes/">per-second billing for the EC2 instances</a> that they launched. The vCPU count usage is comparable to the core count on the largest supercomputers in the world.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/clemson_util_2.png" width="900" height="512" /></p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown of the EC2 instance types that they used:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/clemson_vcpu_dist_1.png" width="810" height="433" /></p>
<p>Campus resources at Clemson funded by the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a> were used to determine an effective configuration for the AWS experiments as compared to campus resources, and the AWS cloud resources complement the campus resources for large-scale experiments.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Meet the Team</strong></span><br />
Here’s the team that ran the experiment (Professor Alexander Herzog, graduate students Christopher Gropp and Brandon Posey, and Professor Amy Apon):</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/clemson_team_1.png" width="710" height="399" /></p>
<p>Professor Apon said about the experiment:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">I am absolutely thrilled with the outcome of this experiment. The graduate students on the project are amazing. They used resources from AWS and Omnibond and developed a new software infrastructure to perform research at a scale and time-to-completion not possible with only campus resources. Per-second billing was a key enabler of these experiments.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/boydwilson/">Boyd Wilson</a> (CEO, Omnibond, member of the AWS Partner Network) told me:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Participating in this project was exciting, seeing how the Clemson team developed a provisioning and workflow automation tool that tied into CloudyCluster to build a huge Spot Fleet supercomputer in a single region in AWS was outstanding.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>About the Experiment</strong></span><br />
The experiments test parameter combinations on a range of topics and other parameters used in the topic model. The topic model outputs are stored in Amazon S3 and are currently being analyzed. The models have been applied to 17 years of computer science journal abstracts (533,560 documents and 32,551,540 words) and full text papers from the <a href="https://nips.cc/">NIPS</a> (Neural Information Processing Systems) Conference (2,484 documents and 3,280,697 words). This study allows the research team to systematically measure and analyze the impact of parameters and model selection on model convergence, topic composition and quality.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Looking Forward</strong></span><br />
This study constitutes an interaction between computer science, artificial intelligence, and high performance computing. Papers describing the full study are being submitted for peer-reviewed publication. I hope that you enjoyed this brief insight into the ways in which AWS is helping to break the boundaries in the frontiers of natural language processing!</p>

<p>Last week <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/" title="">Amazon Pinpoint</a> launched AWS Global SMS two-way text messaging and we didn’t get an opportunity to cover the launch. AWS Pinpoint users can now programmaticaly respond to their end-users’ text messages. Users can provision both short codes and long codes (10-digit phone numbers) which send inbound messages to an SNS topic. Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>First I’ll navigate to the Pinpoint console where I’ll use the “Create a project in Mobile Hub” button in the top right corner. I’ll follow the steps in the wizard until the project is created.</p>

<p><img style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/09/18/2017-09-17-20.26.45.gif" alt="" width="748" height="856" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20928" /></p>
<p>Next, in the Pinpoint console I’ll click “Account Settings” in the top-right of the console window.</p>
<p><img style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/09/18/Screenshot-2017-09-17-20.32.25.png" alt="" width="1024" height="651" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20929" /></p>
<p>At the bottom of the Account Settings page there is a “Number Settings” section. If you don’t already have any short codes or long codes provisioned you’ll have to open a support ticket to request one. It can take multiple weeks for a short code to be approved by all carriers. Long codes are typically easier to provision.</p>
<p><img style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/09/18/Screenshot-2017-09-17-20.33.31.png" alt="" width="1024" height="477" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20930" /></p>
<p>Since I already have a few numbers provisioned I’ll use one of them now by clicking on it which brings me to that number’s configuration page.</p>
<p><img style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/09/18/Screenshot-2017-09-17-20.48.44.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1015" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20931" /></p>
<p>Here I’ll enable 2-way SMS and create an SNS topic for messages.</p>
<p>I could create a quick lambda function to trigger on the SNS topic messages and then respond again with pinpoint.</p>
<pre class="lang-python"><code>
import boto3
pinpoint = boto3.client('pinpoint')
def lambda_handler(event, context):
pinpoint.send_messages(
ApplicationId='557d87b57bdb499f8b5eef575435d3b8',
MessageRequest={
'Addresses': {
event['Records'][0]['Sns']['originationNumber']: {'ChannelType': 'SMS'}
},
'MessageConfiguration': {
'SMSMessage': {
'Body': 'Vim is the best!',
'MessageType': 'TRANSACTIONAL'
}
}
}
)
</code></pre>
<p>But pinpoint is extremely full-featured and you’re not limited to this simple message type. You can define rich <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/campaigns-message.html">messaging campaigns</a> with various substitutions based on stored user data.</p>
<p>SMS is an area of continued investment for AWS so you can expect to see more advances and improvements as customers give us feedback on these new features. Let us know if you build anything cool with this!</p>

<p>Last year we launched new AWS Regions in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-canada-central-region/">Canada</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-asia-pacific-mumbai-region/">India</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-asia-pacific-seoul-region/">Korea</a>, the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-london-region/">UK</a>, and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-us-east-ohio-region/">United States</a>, and announced that new regions are coming to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">China</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/coming-in-2017-new-aws-region-in-france/">France</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-region-in-hong-kong/">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/coming-in-2018-new-aws-region-in-sweden/">Sweden</a>, and a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-govcloud-us-heads-east-new-region-in-the-works-for-2018/">second GovCloud Region</a> in the US throughout 2017 and 2018.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Middle East Region by Early 2019</strong></span><br />
Today, I am happy to announce that we will be opening an AWS Region in the Middle East by early 2019. The new Region will be based in Bahrain, will be comprised of three Availability Zones at launch, and will give AWS customers and partners the ability to run their workloads and store their data in the Middle East.</p>
<p>AWS customers are already making use of 44 Availability Zones across 16 geographic regions. Today’s announcement brings the total number of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">global regions</a> (operational and in the works) up to 22.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>UAE Edge Location in 2018</strong></span><br />
We also plan to open an edge location in the UAE in the first quarter of 2018. This will bring <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" title="">Amazon CloudFront</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/" title="">Amazon Route 53</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/shield/" title="">AWS Shield</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/waf" title="">AWS WAF</a> to the region, adding to our existing set of 84 points of presence world-wide.</p>
<p>These announcements add to our continued investment in the Middle East. Earlier this year we announced the opening of AWS offices in Dubai, UAE and Manama, Bahrain. Prior to this we have supported the growth of technology education in the region with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/">AWS Educate</a> and have supported the growth of new businesses through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/activate/">AWS Activate</a> for many years.</p>
<p>The addition of AWS infrastructure in the Middle East will help countries across the region to innovate, grow their economies, and pursue their vision plans (<a href="http://vision2030.gov.sa/en">Saudi Vision 2030</a>, <a href="https://www.vision2021.ae/en">UAE Vision 2021</a>, <a href="http://bahrainedb.com/about-us/economic-vision-2030/">Bahrain Vision 2030</a>, and so forth).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Talk to Us</strong></span><br />
As always, we are looking forward to serving new and existing customers in the Middle East and working with partners across the region. Of course, the new Region will also be open to existing AWS customers who would like to serve users in the Middle East.</p>

<p>As I have noted in the past, the AWS Blog Team is working hard to make sure that you know about as many AWS launches and publications as possible, without totally burying you in content! As part of our balancing act, we will occasionally publish catch-up posts to clear our queues and to bring more information to your attention. Here’s what I have in store for you today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring for Cross-Region Replication of S3 Objects</li>
<li>Tags for Spot Fleet Instances</li>
<li>PCI DSS Compliance for 12 More Services</li>
<li>HIPAA Eligibility for WorkDocs</li>
<li>VPC Resizing</li>
<li>AppStream 2.0 Graphics Design Instances</li>
<li>AMS Connector App for ServiceNow</li>
<li>Regtech in the Cloud</li>
<li>New &amp; Revised Quick Starts</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s jump right in!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Monitoring for Cross-Region Replication of S3 Objects</strong></span><br />
I told you about <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-cross-region-replication-for-amazon-s3/">cross-region replication for S3</a> a couple of years ago. As I showed you at the time, you simply enable versioning for the source bucket and then choose a destination region and bucket. You can check the replication status manually, or you can create an inventory (daily or weekly) of the source and destination buckets.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/infrastructure-management/crr-monitor/">Cross-Region Replication Monitor</a> (CRR Monitor for short) solution checks the replication status of objects across regions and gives you metrics and failure notifications in near real-time.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/crr_monitor_overview_1.png" width="743" height="461" /></p>
<p>To learn more, read the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/crr-monitor/welcome.html">CRR Monitor Implementation Guide</a> and then use the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" title="">AWS CloudFormation</a> template to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/crr-monitor/deployment.html">Deploy the CRR Monitor</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Tags for Spot Instances</strong></span><br />
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">Spot Instances</a> and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet.html">Spot Fleets</a> (collections of Spot Instances) give you access to spare compute capacity. We recently gave you the ability to enter tags (key/value pairs) as part of your spot requests and to have those tags applied to the EC2 instances launched to fulfill the request:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/tag_spot_instances_1.png" width="754" height="209" /></p>
<p>To learn more, read <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/07/tag-your-spot-fleet-ec2-instances/">Tag Your Spot Fleet EC2 Instances</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>PCI DSS Compliance for 12 More Services</strong></span><br />
As first announced on the AWS Security Blog, we recently <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-adds-12-more-services-to-its-pci-dss-compliance-program/">added 12 more services</a> to our PCI DSS compliance program, raising the total number of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/">in-scope services</a> to 42. To learn more, check out our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/resources/">Compliance Resources</a>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>HIPAA Eligibility for WorkDocs</strong></span><br />
In other compliance news, we announced that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/07/amazon-workdocs-achieves-hipaa-eligibility-and-pci-dss-compliance/">Amazon WorkDocs has achieved HIPAA eligibility and PCI DSS compliance</a> in all AWS Regions where WorkDocs is available.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>VPC Resizing</strong></span><br />
This feature allows you to extend an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) by adding additional blocks of addresses. This gives you more flexibility and should help you to deal with growth. You can add up to four secondary /16 CIDRs per VPC. You can also edit the secondary CIDRs by deleting them and adding new ones. Simply select the VPC and choose <strong>Edit CIDRs</strong> from the menu:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/vpc_edit_cidrs_1.png" width="538" height="344" /></p>
<p>Then add or remove CIDR blocks as desired:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/vpc_cidrs_1.png" width="760" height="582" /></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AMS Connector App for ServiceNow</strong></span><br />
AWS Managed Services (AMS) provides <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/category/aws-managed-services/">Infrastructure Operations Management for the Enterprise</a>. Designed to accelerate cloud adoption, it automates common operations such as change requests, patch management, security and backup.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Regtech in the Cloud</strong></span><br />
<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regtech.asp">Regtech</a> (as I learned while writing this), is short for regulatory technology, and is all about using innovative technology such as cloud computing, analytics, and machine learning to address regulatory challenges.</p>
<p>Working together with APN Consulting Partner <a href="https://www.cognizant.com/">Cognizant</a>, <a href="https://www.tabbgroup.com/">TABB Group</a> recently published a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/345897202/V15-014-Financial-Markets-Embracing-RegTech">thought leadership paper</a> that explains why regulations and compliance pose huge challenges for our customers in the financial services, and shows how AWS can help!</p>

<p><img style="float: right;padding-left: 8px;padding-bottom: 8px" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/req_spot_inst_button_v1.png" /><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">EC2 Spot Instances</a> give you access to spare EC2 compute capacity at up to 90% off of the On-Demand rates. Starting with the ability to request a specific number of instances of a particular size, we made Spot Instances even more useful and flexible with support for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ec2-spot-fleet-api-manage-thousands-of-instances-with-one-request/">Spot Fleets</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-auto-scaling-for-ec2-spot-fleets/">Auto Scaling Spot Fleets</a>, allowing you to maintain any desired level of compute capacity.</p>
<p>EC2 users have long had the ability to stop running instances while leaving EBS volumes attached, opening the door to applications that automatically pick up where they left off when the instance starts running again.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Stop and Resume Spot Workloads</strong></span><br />
Today we are blending these two important features, allowing you to set up Spot bids and Spot Fleets that respond by stopping (rather than terminating) instances when capacity is no longer available at or below your bid price. EBS volumes attached to stopped instances remain intact, as does the EBS-backed root volume. When capacity becomes available, the instances are started and can keep on going without having to spend time provisioning applications, setting up EBS volumes, downloading data, joining network domains, and so forth.</p>
<p>Many AWS customers have enhanced their applications to create and make use of checkpoints, adding some resilience and gaining the ability to take advantage of EC2’s start/stop feature in the process. These customers will now be able to run these applications on Spot Instances, with savings that average 70-90%.</p>
<p>While the instances are stopped, you can modify the EBS Optimization, User data, Ramdisk ID, and Delete on Termination attributes. Stopped Spot Instances do not incur any charges for compute time; space for attached EBS volumes is charged at the usual rates.</p>
<p>Here’s how you create a Spot bid or Spot Fleet and specify the use of stop/start:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/spot_set_stop_1.png" width="793" height="570" /></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Things to Know<br />
</strong></span>This feature is available now and you can start using it today in all AWS Regions where Spot Instances are available. It is designed to work well in conjunction with the new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-per-second-billing-for-ec2-instances-and-ebs-volumes/">per-second billing for EC2 instances and EBS volumes</a>, with the potential for another dimension of cost savings over and above that provided by Spot Instances.</p>
<p>EBS volumes always exist within a particular Availability Zone (AZ). As a result, Spot and Spot Fleet requests that specify a particular AZ will always restart in that AZ.</p>
<p>Take care when using this feature in conjunction with Spot Fleets that have the potential to span a wide variety of instance types. Because the composition of the fleet can change over time, you need to pay attention to your account’s limits for IP addresses and EBS volumes.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to hearing about the new and creative uses that you’ll come up with for this feature. If you thought that your application was not a good fit for Spot Instances, or if the overhead needed to handle interruptions was too high, it is time to take another look!</p>

<p>Back in the old days, you needed to buy or lease a server if you needed access to compute power. When we <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon_ec2_beta/">launched EC2</a> back in 2006, the ability to use an instance for an hour, and to pay only for that hour, was big news. The pay-as-you-go model inspired our customers to think about new ways to develop, test, and run applications of all types.</p>
<p>Today, services like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> prove that we can do a lot of useful work in a short time. Many of our customers are dreaming up applications for EC2 that can make good use of a large number of instances for shorter amounts of time, sometimes just a few minutes.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Per-Second Billing for EC2 and EBS</strong></span><br />
Effective October 2nd, usage of Linux instances that are launched in On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot form will be billed in one-second increments. Similarly, provisioned storage for EBS volumes will be billed in one-second increments.</p>
<p>Per-second billing also applies to several other AWS services:</p>
<p><strong>Amazon EMR</strong> – Our customers add capacity to their EMR clusters in order to get their results more quickly. With per-second billing for the EC2 instances in the clusters, adding nodes is more cost-effective than ever. To learn more, read <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/10/amazon-emr-now-supports-per-second-billing/">Amazon EMR Now Supports Per-Second Billing</a>.</p>
<p><strong>AWS Batch</strong> – Many of the batch jobs that our customers run complete in less than an hour. AWS Batch already launches and terminates Spot Instances; with per-second billing for the EC2 instances, batch processing will become even more economical.</p>
<p><strong>Elastic GPUs</strong> – Usage of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-work-amazon-ec2-elastic-gpus/">Elastic GPUs</a> is billed by the second, with a 1 minute minimum.</p>
<p><strong>Provisioned IOPS</strong> – <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/fast-forward-provisioned-iops-ebs/">Provisioned IOPS</a> for <strong>io1</strong> EBS volumes is billed by the second.</p>
<p>Some of our more sophisticated customers have built systems to get the most value from EC2 by strategically choosing the most advantageous target instances when managing their gaming, ad tech, or 3D rendering fleets. Per-second billing obviates the need for this extra layer of instance management, and brings the costs savings to all customers and all workloads.</p>
<p>While this will result in a price reduction for many workloads (and you know we love <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/category/price-reduction/">price reductions</a>), I don’t think that’s the most important aspect of this change. I believe that this change will inspire you to innovate and to think about your compute-bound problems in new ways. How can you use it to improve your support for continuous integration? Can it change the way that you provision transient environments for your dev and test workloads? What about your analytics, batch processing, and 3D rendering?</p>
<p>One of the many advantages of cloud computing is the elastic nature of provisioning or deprovisioning resources as you need them. By billing usage down to the second we will enable customers to level up their elasticity, save money, and customers will be positioned to take advantage of continuing advances in computing.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Things to Know</strong></span><br />
This change is effective in all AWS Regions and will be effective October 2, for all Linux instances that are newly launched or already running. There is a 1 minute minimum charge per-instance.</p>
<p>Per-second billing is not currently applicable to instances running Microsoft Windows or Linux distributions that have a separate hourly charge. Marketplace AMIs that do not have a separate hourly charge are eligible for per-second billing.</p>
<p>List prices and Spot Market prices are still listed on a per-hour basis, but bills are calculated down to the second, as is Reserved Instance usage (you can launch, use, and terminate multiple instances within an hour and get the Reserved Instance Benefit for all of the instances). Also, bills will show times in decimal form, like this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/psb_bill_example_1.png" width="892" height="255" /></p>
<p>The Dedicated Per Region Fee, EBS Snapshots, and products in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/" title="">AWS Marketplace</a> are still billed on an hourly basis.</p>
