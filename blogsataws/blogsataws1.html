<p>So many launches and cloud innovations, that you simply may not believe.&nbsp; In order to catch up on some service launches and features, this post will be a round-up of some cool releases that happened this summer and through the end of September.</p> 
<p>The launches and features I want to share with you today are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>AWS IAM for Authenticating Database Users for RDS MySQL and Amazon Aurora</strong></li> 
<li><strong>Amazon SES Reputation Dashboard</strong></li> 
<li><strong>Amazon SES Open and Click Tracking Metrics</strong></li> 
<li><strong>Serverless Image Handler by the Solutions Builder Team</strong></li> 
<li><strong>AWS Ops Automator by the Solutions Builder Team</strong></li> 
</ul> 
<p>Let’s dive in, shall we!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #000080"><strong>AWS IAM for Authenticating Database Users for RDS MySQL and Amazon Aurora</strong></span></span></p> 
<p>Wished you could manage access to your Amazon RDS database instances and clusters using AWS IAM? Well, wish no longer. Amazon RDS has launched the ability for&nbsp;you to use IAM to manage database access for Amazon RDS for MySQL and Amazon Aurora DB.</p> 
<p>What I like most about this new service feature is, it’s very easy to get started.&nbsp; To enable database user authentication using IAM, you would select a checkbox <strong>Enable IAM DB Authentication&nbsp;</strong>when creating, modifying, or restoring your DB instance or cluster. You can enable IAM access using the RDS console, the AWS CLI, and/or the Amazon RDS API.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/RDS_IAMAuth-small.png" width="650" height="340" /></p> 
<p>After configuring the database for IAM authentication, client applications authenticate to the database engine by providing temporary security credentials generated by the IAM Security Token Service. These credentials can be used instead of providing a password to the database engine.</p> 
<p>You can learn more about using IAM to provide targeted permissions and authentication to MySQL and Aurora by reviewing the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html">Amazon RDS user guide</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #000080"><strong>Amazon SES Reputation Dashboard</strong></span></p> 
<p>In order to aid <strong>Amazon Simple Email Service</strong> customers’ in utilizing best practice guidelines for sending email, I am thrilled to announce we launched the&nbsp;<strong>Reputation Dashboard </strong>to provide comprehensive reporting on email sending health. To aid in proactively managing emails being sent,&nbsp;customers now have visibility&nbsp;into&nbsp;overall account health, sending metrics, and compliance or enforcement status.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/SESOpenClick-small.png" width="500" height="437" /></p> 
<p>The <strong>Reputation Dashboard</strong> will provide the following information:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>Account status:</strong> A description of your account health status. 
<ul> 
<li>Healthy – No issues currently impacting your account.</li> 
<li>Probation – Account is on probation; Issues causing probation must be resolved to prevent suspension</li> 
<li>Pending end of probation decision – Your account is on probation. Amazon SES team member must review your account prior to action.</li> 
<li>Shutdown – Your account has been shut down. No email will be able to be sent using Amazon SES.</li> 
<li>Pending shutdown – Your account is on probation and issues causing probation are unresolved.</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li><strong>Bounce Rate: </strong>Percentage of emails sent that have bounced and bounce rate status messages.</li> 
<li><strong>Complaint Rate:</strong> Percentage of emails sent that recipients have reported as spam and complaint rate status messages.</li> 
<li><strong>Notifications</strong>: Messages about other account reputation issues.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #000080"><strong>Amazon SES Open and Click Tracking Metrics</strong></span></p> 
<p>Another exciting feature recently added to Amazon SES is support for <strong>Email Open and Click Tracking&nbsp;Metrics</strong>. With&nbsp;<strong>Email Open and Click Tracking Metrics&nbsp;</strong>feature, SES customers can now track when email&nbsp;they’ve sent has been opened and track when links within the email have been clicked.&nbsp; Using this SES feature will allow you to better track email campaign engagement and effectiveness.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/SESOpenClick-small.png" width="500" height="437" /></p> 
<p><strong>How does this work?</strong></p> 
<p>When using the <strong>email open tracking feature</strong>, SES will add a transparent, miniature image into the emails that you choose to track. When the email is opened, the mail application client will load the aforementioned tracking which triggers an open track event with Amazon SES. For the&nbsp;<strong>email click (link) tracking</strong>, links in email and/or email templates are replaced with a custom link.&nbsp; When the custom link is clicked, a click event is recorded in SES and the custom link will redirect the email user&nbsp;to the link destination of the original email.</p> 
<p>You can take advantage of the new open tracking and click tracking features by creating a new configuration set or altering an existing configuration set within SES. After choosing either; <a href="http/aws.amazon.com/sns">Amazon SNS</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch">Amazon CloudWatch</a>, or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/firehose/">Amazon Kinesis Firehose</a> as the AWS service to receive the open and click metrics, you would only need to select&nbsp;a new configuration set to successfully enable these new features for any emails you want to send.</p>

<p>The AWS Solution Builder team has been hard at work helping to make it easier for you all to find answers to common architectural questions to aid in building and running applications on AWS. You can find these solutions on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/">AWS Answers</a> page. Two new solutions released earlier this fall on AWS Answers are&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Serverless Image Handler</strong> and the <strong>AWS Ops Automator</strong>.<br /> <strong>Serverless Image Handler</strong> was developed to provide a solution to help customers dynamically process, manipulate, and optimize the handling of images on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS Cloud</a>. The solution combines <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront">Amazon CloudFront</a> for caching, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda">AWS Lambda</a> to dynamically retrieve images and make image modifications, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a> bucket to store images. Additionally, the Serverless Image Handler leverages the open source image-processing suite, <a href="http://thumbor.org/">Thumbor</a>, for additional image manipulation, processing, and optimization.</p>

<p><strong>AWS Ops Automator</strong> solution helps you to automate manual tasks using time-based or event-based triggers to automatically such as snapshot scheduling by providing a framework for automated tasks and includes task audit trails, logging, resource selection, scaling, concurrency handling, task completion handing, and API request retries. The solution includes the following AWS services:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/OpsAutomator-small.png" width="500" height="255" /></p> 
<ul> 
<li><strong>AWS CloudFormation</strong>: a templates to launches the core framework of microservices and solution generated task configurations</li> 
<li><strong>Amazon DynamoDB</strong>: a table which stores task configuration data to defines the event triggers, resources, and saves the results of the action and the errors.</li> 
<li><strong>Amazon CloudWatch Logs</strong>: provides logging to track warning and error messages</li> 
<li><strong>Amazon SNS</strong>: topic to send messages to a subscribed email address to which to send the logging information from the solution</li> 
</ul>

<p>As I was preparing to write this post, I took a nostalgic look at the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-direct-connect/">blog post</a> I wrote when we launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/" title="">AWS Direct Connect</a> back in 2012. We created Direct Connect after our enterprise customers asked us to allow them to establish dedicated connections to an AWS Region in pursuit of enhanced privacy, additional data transfer bandwidth, and more predictable data transfer performance. Starting from one AWS Region and a single colo, Direct Connect is now available in every public AWS Region and accessible from dozens of colos scattered across the world (over <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/partners/">60 locations</a> at last count). Our customers have taken to Direct Connect wholeheartedly and we have added features such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-direct-connect-update-link-aggregation-groups-bundles-and-reinvent-recap/">Link Aggregation</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-efs-update-on-premises-access-via-direct-connect-vpc/">Amazon EFS support</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/06/aws-direct-connect-now-provides-amazon-cloudwatch-monitoring/">CloudWatch monitoring</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/roundup-of-aws-hipaa-eligible-service-announcements/">HIPAA eligibility</a>. In the past five weeks alone we have added Direct Connect locations in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/09/announcing-new-aws-direct-connect-location-in-houston-tx/">Houston</a> (Texas), <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/10/aws-direct-connect-now-live-in-vancouver-manchester-and-perth/">Vancouver</a> (Canada), <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/10/aws-direct-connect-now-live-in-vancouver-manchester-and-perth/">Manchester</a> (UK), <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/09/announcing-new-aws-direct-connect-location-in-canberra-australia/">Canberra</a> (Australia), and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/10/aws-direct-connect-now-live-in-vancouver-manchester-and-perth/">Perth</a> (Australia).</p> 
<p>Today we are making Direct Connect simpler and more powerful with the addition of the Direct Connect Gateway. We are also giving Direct Connect customers in any Region the ability to create public virtual interfaces that receive our global IP routes and enable access to the public endpoints for our services and updating the Direct Connect pricing model.</p> 
<p>Let’s take a look at each one!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Direct Connect Gateway</strong></span><br /> You can use the new Direct Connect Gateway to establish connectivity that spans Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) spread across multiple AWS Regions. You no longer need to establish multiple BGP sessions for each VPC; this reduces your administrative workload as well as the load on your network devices.</p> 
<p>This feature also allows you to connect to any of the participating VPCs from any Direct Connect location, further reducing your costs for making using AWS services on a cross-region basis.</p> 
<p>Here is a diagram that illustrates the simplification that you can achieve with a Direct Connect Gateway (each “lock” icon represents a Virtual Private Gateway). Start with this:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dc_global_mod_before_1.png" width="597" height="553" /></p> 
<p>And end up like this:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dc_global_mod_after_1.png" width="676" height="553" /></p> 
<p>The VPCs that reference a particular Direct Connect Gateway must have IP address ranges that do not overlap. Today, the VPCs must all be in the same AWS account; we plan to make this more flexible in the future.</p> 
<p>Each Gateway is a global object that exists across all of the public AWS Regions. All communication between the Regions via the Gateways takes place across the AWS network backbone.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Creating a Direct Connect Gateway</strong></span><br /> You can create a Direct Connect Gateway from the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/home?region=us-east-1#dxgateway:">Direct Connect Console</a> or by calling the <code><a title="undefined" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDirectConnectGateway.html" target="null">CreateDirectConnectGateway</a></code> function from your code. I’ll use the Console!</p> 
<p>I open the Direct Connect Console and click on <strong>Direct Connect Gateways</strong> to get started:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dcg_dc_con_home_1.png" width="810" height="468" /></p> 
<p>The list is empty since I don’t have any Gateways yet. Click on <strong>Create Direct Connect Gateway</strong> to change that:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dcg_con_gws_1.png" width="810" height="232" /></p> 
<p>I give my Gateway a name, enter a private ASN for my network, then click on <strong>Create</strong>. The ASN (Autonomous System Number) must be in one of the ranges defined as private in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6996">RFC 6996</a>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dcg_create_1.png" width="900" height="283" /></p> 
<p>My new Gateway will appear in the other AWS Regions within a moment or two:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dcg_now_in_ohio_1.png" width="810" height="414" /></p> 
<p>I have a Direct Connect Connection in Ohio that I will use to create my VIF:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dcg_my_conn_ohio_2.png" width="900" height="259" /></p> 
<p>Now I create a private VIF that references the Gateway and the Connection:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dcg_go_ahead_make_my_vif_1.png" width="900" height="772" /></p> 
<p>It is ready to use within seconds:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dcg_my_vif_1.png" width="900" height="239" /></p> 
<p>I already have a pair of VPCs with non-overlapping CIDRs, and a Virtual Private Gateway attached to each one. Here are the VPCs (since this is a demo I’ll show both in the same Region for convenience):</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dcg_vpcs_1.png" width="653" height="276" /></p> 
<p>And the Virtual Private Gateways:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dcg_vpgs_1.png" width="857" height="244" /></p> 
<p>I return to the Direct Connect Console and navigate to the Direct Connect Gateways. I select my Gateway and choose <strong>Associate Virtual Private Gateway</strong> from the <strong>Actions</strong> menu:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dcg_associate_1.png" width="370" height="206" /></p> 
<p>Then I select both of my Virtual Private Gateways and click on <strong>Associate</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dcg_associate_vpg_1.png" width="809" height="472" /></p> 
<p>If, as would usually be the case, my VPCs are in distinct AWS Regions, the same procedure would apply. For this blog post it was easier to show you the operations once rather than twice.</p> 
<p>The Virtual Gateway association is complete within a minute or so (the state starts out as <strong>associating</strong>):</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dcg_gateways_associating_1.png" width="807" height="555" /></p> 
<p>When the state transitions to <strong>associated</strong>, traffic can flow between your on-premises network and your VPCs, over your AWS Direct Connect connection, regardless of the AWS Regions where your VPCs reside.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Public Virtual Interfaces for Service Endpoints</strong></span><br /> You can now create Public Virtual Interfaces that will allow you to access AWS public service endpoints for AWS services running in any AWS Region (except AWS China Region) over Direct Connect. These interfaces receive (via BGP) Amazon’s global IP routes. You can create these interfaces in the Direct Connect Console; start by selecting the <strong>Public</strong> option:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dcg_public_vi_1.png" width="742" height="417" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Updated Pricing Model</strong></span><br /> In light of the ever-expanding number of AWS Regions and AWS Direct Connect locations, data transfer pricing is now based on the location of the Direct Connect and the source AWS Region. The new pricing is simpler that the older model which was based on AWS Direct Connect locations.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Now Available</strong></span><br /> This new feature is available today and you can start to use it right now. You can create and use Direct Connect Gateways at no charge; you pay the usual <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/pricing/">Direct Connect prices</a> for port hours and data transfer.</p>

<p>Nine years ago I showed you how you could <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/distribute-your-content-with-amazon-cloudfront/">Distribute Your Content with Amazon CloudFront</a>. We launched CloudFront in 2008 with 14 Points of Presence and have been expanding rapidly ever since. Today I am pleased to announce the opening of our 100<sup>th</sup> Point of Presence, the fifth one in Tokyo and the sixth in Japan. With 89 Edge Locations and 11 Regional Edge Caches, CloudFront now supports traffic generated by millions of viewers around the world.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>23 Countries, 50 Cities, and Growing</strong></span><br /> Those <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/details/">100 Points of Presence</a> span the globe, with sites in 50 cities and 23 countries. In the past 12 months we have expanded the size of our network by about 58%, adding 37 Points of Presence, including nine in the following new cities:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Berlin, Germany</li> 
<li>Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA</li> 
<li>Prague, Czech Republic</li> 
<li>Boston, Massachusetts, USA</li> 
<li>Munich, Germany</li> 
<li>Vienna, Austria</li> 
<li>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</li> 
<li>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA</li> 
<li>Zurich, Switzerland</li> 
</ul> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cf_map_2017_locs_1.png" width="900" height="488" /></p> 
<p>We have even more in the works, including an Edge Location in the United Arab Emirates, currently planned for the first quarter of 2018.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Innovating for Our Customers</strong></span><br /> As I mentioned earlier, our network consists of a mix of Edge Locations and Regional Edge Caches. First <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/11/announcing-regional-edge-caches-for-amazon-cloudfront/">announced</a> at re:Invent 2016, the Regional Edge Caches sit between our Edge Locations and your origin servers, have even more memory than the Edge Locations, and allow us to store content close to the viewers for rapid delivery, all while reducing the load on the origin servers.</p> 
<p>While locations are important, they are just a starting point. We continue to focus on security with the recent launch of our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/09/amazon-cloudfront-now-lets-you-select-a-security-policy-with-minimum-tls-v1_1-1_2-and-security-ciphers-for-viewer-connections/">Security Policies</a> feature and our announcement that CloudFront is a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/06/cloudfront-s3-transfer-acceleration-waf-shield-are-now-hipaa-eligible/">HIPAA-eligible</a> service. We gave you more content-serving and content-generation options with the launch of<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/lambdaedge-intelligent-processing-of-http-requests-at-the-edge/"> Lambda@Edge</a>, letting you run <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> functions close to your users.</p> 
<p>We have also been working to accelerate the processing of cache invalidations and configuration changes. We now accept invalidations within milliseconds of the request and confirm that the request has been processed world-wide, typically within 60 seconds. This helps to ensure that your customers have access to fresh, timely content!</p>

<p>In 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reported that <a href="https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nationalhealthaccountshistorical.html">healthcare spending made up 17.8% of the U.S. GDP</a> – that’s almost $3.2 trillion or $9,990 per person. By 2025, <a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2017/02/16/spending-growth">the CMS estimates this number will increase to nearly 20%</a>. As cloud technology evolves in the healthcare and life science industries, we are seeing how companies of all sizes are using AWS to provide powerful and innovative solutions to customers across the globe. This month we are excited to feature the following startups:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>ClearCare </b>– helping home care agencies operate efficiently and grow their business.</li> 
<li><b>DNAnexus </b>– providing a cloud-based global network for sharing and managing genomic data.</li> 
</ul> 
<p><b>ClearCare (San Francisco, CA)<a href="https://www.clearcareonline.com/"><img class=" wp-image-21479 alignright" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/10/30/clearcare-300x128.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="160" /></a></b></p> 
<p><a href="https://www.clearcareonline.com/">ClearCare</a> envisions a future where home care is the only choice for aging in place. Home care agencies play a critical role in the economy and their communities by significantly lowering the overall cost of care, reducing the number of hospital admissions, and bending the cost curve of aging. Patients receiving home care typically have multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations, driving over $190 billion in healthcare spending in the U.S. each year. To offset these costs, health insurance payers are developing in-home care management programs for patients. ClearCare’s goal is to help home care agencies leverage technology to improve costs, outcomes, and quality of life for the aging population. The company’s powerful software platform is specifically designed for use by non-medical, in-home care agencies to manage their businesses.</p> 
<p>Founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/geoffrey-nudd-7501b9/">Geoff Nudd</a> created ClearCare because of his own grandmother’s need for care. Keeping family members and caregivers up to date on a loved one’s well being can be difficult, so Geoff created what is now ClearCare’s <a href="https://www.clearcareonline.com/family-room">Family Room</a>, which enables caregivers and agency staff to check schedules and receive real-time updates about what’s happening in the home. Since then, agencies have provided feedback on others areas of their businesses that could be streamlined. ClearCare has now built over 20 modules to help home care agencies optimize operations with services including a <a href="https://www.clearcareonline.com/smart-telephony">telephony service</a>, <a href="https://www.clearcareonline.com/billing-payroll">billing and payroll</a>, and more. ClearCare now serves over 4,000 home care agencies, representing 500,000 caregivers and 400,000 seniors.</p> 
<p>Using AWS, ClearCare is able to spin up reliable infrastructure for proofs of concept and iterate on those systems to quickly get value to market.

<p><a href="https://www.dnanexus.com/">DNAnexus</a> is accelerating the application of genomic data in precision medicine by <a href="https://www.dnanexus.com/"><img class=" wp-image-21480 alignright" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/10/30/dnanexus-medium-300x53.png" alt="" width="390" height="69" /></a>providing a cloud-based platform for sharing and managing genomic and biomedical data and analysis tools. The company was founded in 2009 by Stanford graduate student <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asundqui/">Andreas Sundquist</a> and two Stanford professors <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arend-sidow-19b74211/">Arend Sidow</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/serafim-batzoglou-89a148/">Serafim Batzoglou</a>, to address the need for scaling secondary analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data in the cloud. The founders quickly learned that users needed a flexible solution to build complex analysis workflows and tools that enable them to share and manage large volumes of data. DNAnexus is optimized to address the challenges of security, scalability, and collaboration for organizations that are pursuing genomic-based approaches to health, both in clinics and research labs. DNAnexus has a global customer base – spanning North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, South America, and Africa – that runs a million jobs each month and is doubling their storage year-over-year. The company currently stores more than 10 petabytes of biomedical and genomic data. That is equivalent to approximately 100,000 genomes, or in simpler terms, over 50 billion Facebook photos!</p> 
<p>DNAnexus is working with its customers to help expand their translational informatics research, which includes expanding into clinical trial genomic services. This will help companies developing different medicines to better stratify clinical trial populations and develop companion tests that enable the right patient to get the right medicine. In collaboration with <a href="http://www.janssen.com/human-microbiome-institute">Janssen Human Microbiome Institute</a>, DNAnexus is also launching <a href="http://mosaicbiome.com/">Mosaic</a> – a community platform for microbiome research.</p> 
<p>AWS provides DNAnexus and its customers the flexibility to grow and scale research programs. Building the technology infrastructure required to manage these projects in-house is expensive and time-consuming. DNAnexus removes that barrier for labs of any size by using AWS scalable cloud resources. The company deploys its customers’ genomic pipelines on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a>, using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> for high-performance, high-durability storage, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/">Amazon Glacier</a> for low-cost data archiving. DNAnexus is also an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/health/life-sciences-partners/">AWS Life Sciences Competency Partner</a>.</p>

<p>Driven by customer demand and made possible by on-going advances in the state-of-the-art, we’ve come a long way since the original <strong>m1.small</strong> instance that we launched in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon_ec2_beta/">2006</a>, with instances that emphasize compute power, burstable performance, memory size, local storage, and accelerated computing.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>The New P3</strong></span><br /> Today we are making the next generation of GPU-powered EC2 instances available in four AWS regions. Powered by up to eight <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-v100/">NVIDIA Tesla V100</a> GPUs, the P3 instances are designed to handle compute-intensive machine learning, deep learning, computational fluid dynamics, computational finance, seismic analysis, molecular modeling, and genomics workloads.</p> 
<p>P3 instances use customized Intel Xeon E5-2686v4 processors running at up to 2.7 GHz. They are available in three sizes (all VPC-only and EBS-only):</p>

<p>Each of the NVIDIA GPUs is packed with 5,120 CUDA cores and another 640 Tensor cores and can deliver up to 125 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS">TFLOPS</a> of mixed-precision floating point, 15.7 TFLOPS of single-precision floating point, and 7.8 TFLOPS of double-precision floating point. On the two larger sizes, the GPUs are connected together via <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/nvlink.html">NVIDIA NVLink 2.0</a> running at a total data rate of up to 300 GBps. This allows the GPUs to exchange intermediate results and other data at high speed, without having to move it through the CPU or the PCI-Express fabric.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>What’s a Tensor Core?</strong></span><br /> I had not heard the term Tensor core before starting to write this post. According to this <a href="https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/inside-volta/">very helpful post</a> on the NVIDIA Blog, Tensor cores are designed to speed up the training and inference of large, deep neural networks. Each core is able to quickly and efficiently multiply a pair of 4&times;4 half-precision (also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format">FP16</a>) matrices together, add the resulting 4&times;4 matrix to another half or single-precision (FP32) matrix, and store the resulting 4&times;4 matrix in either half or single-precision form. Here’s a diagram from NVIDIA’s blog post:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/nvidia_tensor_core_op_math_2.png" width="800" height="198" /></p> 
<p>This operation is in the innermost loop of the training process for a deep neural network, and is an excellent example of how today’s NVIDIA GPU hardware is purpose-built to address a very specific market need. By the way, the <em>mixed-precision</em> qualifier on the Tensor core performance means that it is flexible enough to work with with a combination of 16-bit and 32-bit floating point values.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Performance in Perspective</strong></span><br /> I always like to put raw performance numbers into a real-world perspective so that they are easier to relate to and (hopefully) more meaningful. This turned out to be surprisingly difficult, given that the eight NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs on a single <strong>p3.16xlarge</strong> can do 125 trillion single-precision floating point multiplications per second.</p> 
<p>Let’s go back to the dawn of the microprocessor era, and consider the Intel 8080A chip that powered the MITS Altair that I bought in the summer of 1977. With a 2 MHz clock, it was able to do about 832 multiplications per second (I used <a href="https://www.pcjs.org/pubs/pc/reference/intel/8087/">this data</a> and corrected it for the faster clock speed). The <strong>p3.16xlarge</strong> is roughly 150 billion times faster. However, just 1.2 billion seconds have gone by since that summer. In other words, I can do 100x more calculations today in one second than my Altair could have done in the last 40 years!</p> 
<p>What about the innovative 8087 math coprocessor that was an optional accessory for the IBM PC that was announced in the summer of 1981? With a 5 MHz clock and purpose-built hardware, it was able to do about 52,632 multiplications per second. 1.14 billion seconds have elapsed since then, <strong>p3.16xlarge</strong> is 2.37 billion times faster, so the poor little PC would be barely halfway through a calculation that would run for 1 second today.</p> 
<p>Ok, how about a Cray-1? First delivered in 1976, this supercomputer was able to perform vector operations at 160 MFLOPS, making the <strong>p3.x16xlarge</strong> 781,000 times faster. It could have iterated on some interesting problem 1500 times over the years since it was introduced.</p> 
<p>Comparisons between the P3 and today’s scale-out supercomputers are harder to make, given that you can think of the P3 as a step-and-repeat component of a supercomputer that you can launch on as as-needed basis.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Run One Today<br /> </strong></span>In order to take full advantage of the NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs and the Tensor cores, you will need to use <a title="undefined" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit/whatsnew" target="null">CUDA 9</a> and <a title="undefined" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn" target="null">cuDNN7</a>. These drivers and libraries have already been added to the newest versions of the Windows AMIs and will be included in an updated Amazon Linux AMI that is scheduled for release on November 7th. New packages are already available in our repos if you want to to install them on your existing Amazon Linux AMI.</p> 
<p>The newest <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/amis/">AWS Deep Learning AMIs</a> come preinstalled with the latest releases of Apache MxNet, Caffe2, and Tensorflow (each with support for the NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs), and will be updated to support P3 instances with other machine learning frameworks such as Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit and PyTorch as soon as these frameworks release support for the NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs. You can also use the NVIDIA Volta Deep Learning AMI for NGC.</p> 
<p>P3 instances are available in the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span>, and <span title="">Asia Pacific (Tokyo)</span> Regions in On-Demand, Spot, Reserved Instance, and Dedicated Host form.</p>

<p>Late last year I told you about our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-aurora-update-postgresql-compatibility/">plans</a> to add PostgreSQL compatibility to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/" title="">Amazon Aurora</a>. We launched the private beta shortly after that announcement, and followed it up earlier this year with an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/sign-up-today-preview-of-amazon-aurora-with-postgresql-compatibility/">open preview</a>. We’ve received lots of great feedback during the beta and the preview and have done our best to make sure that the product meets your needs and exceeds your expectations!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Now Generally Available</strong></span><br /> I am happy to report that Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL Compatibility is now generally available and that you can use it today in four AWS Regions, with more to follow. It is compatible with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/release-9-6-3.html">PostgreSQL 9.6.3</a> and scales automatically to support up to 64 TB of storage, with 6-way replication behind the scenes to improve performance and availability.</p> 
<p>Just like Amazon Aurora with MySQL compatibility, this edition is fully managed and is very easy to set up and to use. On the performance side, you can expect up to 3x the throughput that you’d get if you ran PostgreSQL on your own (you can read <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/p1041-verbitski.pdf">Amazon Aurora: Design Considerations for High Throughput Cloud-Native Relational Databases</a> to learn more about how we did this).</p> 
<p>You can launch a PostgreSQL-compatible Amazon Aurora instance from the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home">RDS Console</a> by selecting Amazon Aurora as the engine and PostgreSQL-compatible as the edition, and clicking on <strong>Next</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_console_launch_page1_3.png" width="688" height="635" /></p> 
<p>Then choose your instance class, single or Multi-AZ deployment (good for dev/test and production, respectively), set the instance name, and the administrator credentials, and click on <strong>Next</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_console_launch_page2_2.png" width="775" height="535" /></p> 
<p>You can choose between six instance classes (2 to 64 vCPUs and 15.25 to 488 GiB of memory):</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_console_instance_types_menu_2.png" width="286" height="162" /></p> 
<p>The <strong>db.r4</strong> instance class is new addition to Aurora and to RDS, and gives you an additional size at the top-end. The <strong>db.r4.16xlarge</strong> will give you additional write performance, and may allow you to use a single Aurora database instead of two or more sharded databases.</p> 
<p>You can also set many advanced options on the next page, starting with network options such as the VPC and public accessibility:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_adv_net_3.png" width="770" height="357" /></p> 
<p>You can set the cluster name and other database options. Encryption is easy to use and enabled by default; you can use the built-in default master key or choose one of your own:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_adv_db_3.png" width="900" height="482" /></p> 
<p>You can also set failover behavior, the retention period for snapshot backups, and choose to enable collection of detailed (OS-level) metrics via Enhanced Monitoring:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_adv_fbr_2.png" width="895" height="593" /></p> 
<p>After you have set it up to your liking, click on <strong>Launch DB Instance</strong> to proceed!</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_takeoff_2.png" width="661" height="600" /></p> 
<p>The new instances (primary and secondary since I specified Multi-AZ) are up and running within minutes:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_running_3.png" /></p> 
<p>Each PostgreSQL-compatible instance publishes 44 metrics to CloudWatch automatically:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_metrics_std_2.png" width="810" height="922" /></p> 
<p>With enhanced monitoring enabled, each instance collects additional per-instance and per-process metrics. It can be enabled when the instance is launched, or afterward, via <strong>Modify Instance</strong>. Here are some of the metrics collected when enhanced monitoring is enabled:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_enh_metrics_2.png" width="810" height="629" /></p> 
<p>Clicking on Manage Graphs lets you choose which metrics are shown:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_pick_em_1.png" width="830" height="715" /></p> 
<p>Per-process metrics are also available:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_procs_1.png" width="810" height="527" /></p> 
<p>You can scale your read capacity by creating up to 15 Aurora replicas:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_create_rr_2.png" width="288" height="527" /></p> 
<p>The cluster provides a single reader endpoint that you can access in order to load-balance requests across the replicas:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_endpoint_2.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Performance Insights</strong></span><br /> As I noted earlier, Performance Insights is turned on automatically. This Amazon Aurora feature is wired directly into the database engine and allows you to look deep inside of each query, seeing the database resources that it uses and how they contribute to the overall response time. Here’s the initial view:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_pi_load_2.png" /></p> 
<p>I can slice the view by SQL query in order to see how many concurrent copies of each query are running:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/pg_rds_pi_load_by_query_2.png" /></p> 
<p>There are more views and options than I can fit in this post; to learn more take a look at <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.html">Using Performance Insights</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Migrating to Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL Compatibility</strong></span><br /> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dms/" title="">AWS Database Migration Service</a> and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dms/#sct" title="">Schema Conversion Tool</a> are ready to help you to move data stored in commercial and open-source databases to Amazon Aurora. The Schema Conversion Tool will perform a quick assessment of your database schemas and your code in order to help you to choose between MySQL and PostgreSQL. Our new, limited-time, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dms/free-dms/">Free DMS</a> program allows you to use DMS and SCT to migrate to Aurora at no cost, with access to several types of DMS Instances for up to 6 months.</p> 
<p>If you are already using PostgreSQL, you will be happy to hear that we support a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_PostgreSQL.html#PostgreSQL.Concepts.General.FeatureSupport.Extensions.96x">long list of extensions</a> including <a href="http://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/dblink.html">dblink</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> You can use Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL Compatibility today in the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span>, <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, and <span title="">US East (Ohio)</span> Regions, with others to follow as soon as possible.</p>

<p>You have long had the ability to tag your AWS resources and to see cost breakouts on a per-tag basis. Cost allocation was launched in 2012 (see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-cost-allocation/">AWS Cost Allocation for Customer Bills</a>) and we have steadily added support for additional services, most recently DynamoDB (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/announcing-tagging-for-amazon-dynamodb/">Introducing Cost Allocation Tags for Amazon DynamoDB</a>), Lambda (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/04/aws-lambda-supports-tagging-and-cost-allocations/">AWS Lambda Supports Tagging and Cost Allocations</a>), and EBS (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-cost-allocation-for-ebs-snapshots/">New – Cost Allocation for AWS Snapshots</a>).</p> 
<p>Today, we are launching tag-based cost allocation for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" title="">Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)</a>. You can now assign tags to your queues and use them to manage your costs at any desired level: application, application stage (for a loosely coupled application that communicates via queues), project, department, or developer. After you have tagged your queues, you can use the AWS Tag Editor to search queues that have tags of interest.</p> 
<p>Here’s how I would add three tags (<strong>app</strong>, <strong>stage</strong>, and <strong>department</strong>) to one of my queues:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/sqs_tag_queue_1.png" width="860" height="521" /></p> 
<p>This feature is available now in all AWS Regions and you can start using in today! To learn more about tagging, read <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-queue-tags.html">Tagging Your Amazon SQS Queues</a>. To learn more about cost allocation via tags, read <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html">Using Cost Allocation Tags</a>. To learn more about how to use message queues to build loosely coupled microservices for modern applications, read our blog post (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-loosely-coupled-scalable-c-applications-with-amazon-sqs-and-amazon-sns/">Building Loosely Coupled, Scalable, C# Applications with Amazon SQS and Amazon SNS</a>) and watch the recording of our recent webinar, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UesxWuZMZqI">Decouple and Scale Applications Using Amazon SQS and Amazon SNS</a>.</p> 
<p>If you are coming to <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a>, plan to attend session <a href="https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=17553">ARC 330: How the BBC Built a Massive Media Pipeline Using Microservices</a>. In the talk you will find out how they used SNS and SQS to improve the elasticity and reliability of the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer">BBC iPlayer</a> architecture.</p>

<p>With just 40 days remaining before <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a> begins, my colleagues and I want to share some tips that will help you to make the most of your time in Las Vegas. As always, our focus is on training and education, mixed in with some after-hours fun and recreation for balance.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Locations, Locations, Locations</strong></span><br /> The <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/campus/">re:Invent Campus</a> will span the length of the Las Vegas strip, with events taking place at the MGM Grand, Aria, Mirage, Venetian, Palazzo, the Sands Expo Hall, the Linq Lot, and the Encore. Each venue will host tracks devoted to specific topics:</p> 
<p><a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/campus/"><img style="float: right;margin-left: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/reinvent_2017_strip_map_1.png" /></a><strong>MGM Grand</strong> – Business Apps, Enterprise, Security, Compliance, Identity, Windows.</p> 
<p><strong>Aria</strong> – Analytics &amp; Big Data, Alexa, Container, IoT, AI &amp; Machine Learning, and Serverless.</p> 
<p><strong>Mirage</strong> – Bootcamps, Certifications &amp; Certification Exams.</p> 
<p><strong>Venetian / Palazzo / Sands Expo Hall</strong> – Architecture, AWS Marketplace &amp; Service Catalog, Compute, Content Delivery, Database, DevOps, Mobile, Networking, and Storage.</p> 
<p><strong>Linq Lot</strong> – Alexa Hackathons, Gameday, Jam Sessions, re:Play Party, Speaker Meet &amp; Greets.</p> 
<p><strong>Encore</strong> – <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/info/bookable-meeting-space/">Bookable meeting space</a>.</p> 
<p>If your interests span more than one topic, plan to take advantage of the re:Invent shuttles that will be making the rounds between the venues.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Lots of Content</strong></span><br /> The <a href="https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/search.ww">re:Invent Session Catalog</a> is now live and you should start to choose the sessions of interest to you now.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/search.ww"><img style="float: right;margin-left: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/reinvent_2017_session_catalog_1.png" /></a>With more than 1100 sessions on the agenda, planning is essential! Some of the most popular “deep dive” sessions will be run more than once and others will be streamed to overflow rooms at other venues. We’ve analyzed a lot of data, run some simulations, and are doing our best to provide you with multiple opportunities to build an action-packed schedule.</p> 
<p>We’re just about ready to let you reserve seats for your sessions (follow <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffbarr">me</a> and/or <a href="https://twitter.com/awscloud">@awscloud</a> on Twitter for a heads-up). Based on feedback from earlier years, we have fine-tuned our seat reservation model. This year, 75% of the seats for each session will be reserved and the other 25% are for walk-up attendees. We’ll start to admit walk-in attendees 10 minutes before the start of the session.</p> 
<p>Las Vegas never sleeps and neither should you! This year we have a host of late-night sessions, workshops, chalk talks, and hands-on labs to keep you busy after dark.</p> 
<p>To learn more about our plans for sessions and content, watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIngAvWk0gY">Get Ready for re:Invent 2017 Content Overview</a> video.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Have Fun</strong></span><br /> After you’ve had enough training and learning for the day, plan to attend the <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/pubcrawl/">Pub Crawl</a>, the <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/replay/">re:Play party</a>, the <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/tatonka-challenge/">Tatonka Challenge</a> (two locations this year), our <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/hands-on-lego/">Hands-On LEGO Activities</a>, and the <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/harley-ride">Harley Ride</a>. Stay fit with our <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/run/">4K Run</a>, <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/spinning-challenge/">Spinning Challenge</a>, <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/bootcamp/">Fitness Bootcamps</a>, and <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/play/broomball/">Broomball</a> (a longstanding Amazon tradition).</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>See You in Vegas</strong></span><br /> As always, I am looking forward to meeting as many AWS users and blog readers as possible. Never hesitate to stop me and to say hello!</p>
