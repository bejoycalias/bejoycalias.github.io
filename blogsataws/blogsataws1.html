<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Operating Partner</strong></span><br /> To comply with China’s legal and regulatory requirements, AWS has formed a strategic technology collaboration with NWCD to operate and provide services from the AWS <span title="">China (Ningxia)</span> Region. Founded in 2015, NWCD is a licensed datacenter and cloud services provider, based in Ningxia, China. NWCD joins Sinnet, the operator of the AWS China <span title="">China (Beijing)</span> Region, as an AWS operating partner in China. Through these relationships, AWS provides its industry-leading technology, guidance, and expertise to NWCD and Sinnet, while NWCD and Sinnet operate and provide AWS cloud services to local customers. While the cloud services offered in both AWS China Regions are the same as those available in other AWS Regions, the AWS China Regions are different in that they are isolated from all other AWS Regions and operated by AWS’s Chinese partners separately from all other AWS Regions. Customers using the AWS China Regions enter into customer agreements with Sinnet and NWCD, rather than with AWS.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Use it Today</strong></span><br /> The AWS <span title="">China (Ningxia)</span> Region, operated by NWCD, is open for business, and you can start using it now! Starting today, Chinese developers, startups, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and non-profit organizations, can leverage AWS to run their applications and store their data in the new AWS <span title="">China (Ningxia)</span> Region, operated by NWCD. Customers already using the AWS <span title="">China (Beijing)</span> Region, operated by Sinnet, can select the AWS <span title="">China (Ningxia)</span> Region directly from the AWS Management Console, while new customers can request an account at <a href="http://www.amazonaws.cn/">www.amazonaws.cn</a> to begin using both AWS China Regions.</p>

<p>My colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandyacarter/">Sandy Carter</a> delivered the Enterprise Innovation State of the Union last week at <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a>. She wrote the guest post below to recap the announcements that she made from the stage.</p> 
<p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffbarr">Jeff</a>;</p> 
<hr /> 
<p>“I want my company to innovate, but I am not convinced we can execute successfully.” Far too many times I have heard this fear expressed by senior executives that I have met at different points in my career. In fact, a <a href="https://www.pwc.lu/en/advisory/docs/pwc-breakthrough-innovation-and-growth.pdf">recent study</a> published by Price Waterhouse Coopers found that while 93% of executives depend on innovation to drive growth, more than half are challenged to take innovative ideas to market quickly in a scalable way.</p> 
<p>Many customers are struggling with how to drive enterprise innovation, so I was thrilled to share the stage at AWS re:Invent this past week with several senior executives who have successfully broken this mold to drive amazing enterprise innovation. In particular, I want to thank <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paragkarnik/">Parag Karnik</a> from Johnson &amp; Johnson, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-rothe-4343288/">Bill Rothe</a> from Hess Corporation, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ukdavew/">Dave Williams</a> from Just Eat, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olgavlagunova/">Olga Lagunova</a> from Pitney Bowes for sharing their stories of innovation, creativity, and solid execution.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/aws_heart_windows_2.png" /></p> 
<p>Among the many new announcements from AWS this past week, I am particularly excited about the following newly-launched AWS products and programs that I announced at re:Invent to drive new innovations by our enterprise customers:</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AI: New Deep Learning Amazon Machine Image (AMI) on EC2 Windows</strong></span><br /> As I shared at re:Invent, customers such as <a href="http://www.infor.com/">Infor</a> are already successfully leveraging artificial intelligence tools on AWS to deliver tailored, industry-specific applications to their customers. We want to facilitate more of our Windows developers to get started quickly and easily with AI, leveraging machine learning based tools with popular deep learning frameworks, such as Apache <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mxnet/" title="">MXNet</a>, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" title="">TensorFlow</a>, and <a href="https://caffe2.ai/" title="">Caffe2</a>. In order to enable this, I announced at re:Invent that AWS now offers a new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/amis/">Deep Learning AMI</a> for Microsoft Windows. The AMI is tailored to facilitate large scale training of deep-learning models, and enables quick and easy setup of Windows Server-based compute resources for machine learning applications.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>IoT: Visualize and Analyze SQL and IoT Data</strong></span><br /> Forecasts show as many as <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/471264/iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide/">31 billion IoT devices by 2020</a>. AWS wants every Windows customer to take advantage of the data available from their devices. Pitney Bowes, for example, now has more than 130,000 IoT devices streaming data to AWS. Using machine learning, Pitney Bowes enriches and analyzes data to enhance their customer experience, improve efficiencies, and create new data products. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/announcing-aws-iot-analytics/">AWS IoT Analytics</a> can now be leveraged to run analytics on IoT data and get insights that help you make better and more accurate decisions for IoT applications and machine learning use cases. AWS IoT Analytics can <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/launch-presenting-aws-iot-analytics/">automatically enrich IoT device data with contextual metadata</a> such as your SQL Server transactional data.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Capabilities for .NET Developers on AWS</strong></span><br /> In addition to all of the enhancements we’ve introduced to deliver a first class experience to Windows developers on AWS, we announced that we are including .NET Core 2.0 support in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/" title="">AWS CodeBuild</a>, which will be available for broader use early next year. .NET Core 2.0 packs a number of new features such as Razor pages, better compatibility with .NET framework, more than double the number of APIs compared to the previous versions, and much more. With this announcement, you will be able to take advantage of all latest .NET Core features on Lambda and CodeBuild for building modern serverless and DevOps centric solutions.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Simplified Backup for Windows Applications</strong></span><br /> We recently introduced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/amazon-ec2-now-offers-application-consistent-snapshots-with-microsoft-vss/">application consistent snapshots with Microsoft Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)</a>. This enables you to take <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee923636.aspx">VSS</a> snapshots with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/" title="">Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)</a> for your running Windows instances without the need to create custom scripts or to shut down the instances. This removes the overhead associated with backing up your Windows applications.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>License optimization for BYOL</strong></span><br /> AWS provides you a wide variety of instance types and families that best meet your workload needs. If you are using software licensed by the number of vCPUs, you want the ability to further tweak vCPU count to optimize license spend. I announced the upcoming ability to optimize CPUs for EC2, giving you greater control over your EC2 instances on two fronts:</p> 
<ol> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em">You can specify a custom number of vCPUs when launching new instances to save on vCPU based licensing costs. For example, SQL Server licensing spend.</li> 
<li>You can disable Hyper-Threading Technology for workloads that perform well with single-threaded CPUs, like some high-performance computing (HPC) applications.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Using these capabilities, customers who bring their own license (BYOL) will be able to optimize their license usage and save on the license costs.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Server Migration Service for Hyper-V Virtual Machines</strong></span><br /> As Bill Rothe from Hess Corporation shared at re:Invent, Hess has successfully migrated a wide range of workloads to the cloud, including SQL Server, SharePoint, SAP HANA, and many others. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/server-migration-service/">AWS Server Migration Service</a> (SMS) now supports <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/server-migration-service/faqs/#hyper-v">Hyper-V virtual machine (VM) migration</a>, in order to further support enterprise migrations like these. AWS Server Migration Service will enable you to more easily co-ordinate large-scale server migrations from on-premise Hyper-V environments to AWS. AWS Server Migration Service allows you to automate, schedule, and track incremental replications of live server volumes. The replicated volumes are encrypted in transit and saved as a new Amazon Machine Image (AMI), which can be launched as an EC2 instance on AWS.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Microsoft Premier Support for AWS End-Customers</strong></span><br /> I was pleased to announce that Microsoft and AWS have developed new areas of support integration to help ensure a great customer experience. Microsoft Premier Support is on board to help AWS assist end customers. AWS Support engineers can escalate directly to Microsoft Support on behalf of AWS customers running Microsoft workloads.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Best Practice Tools: HIPAA Compliance and Digital Innovation Workshop</strong></span><br /> In November, we updated our <a href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_HIPAA_Compliance_Whitepaper.pdf">HIPAA-focused white paper</a>, outlining how you can use AWS to create HIPAA-compliant applications. In the first quarter of next year, we will publish a HIPAA Implementation Guide that expands on our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/accelerator-hipaa/">HIPAA Quick Start</a> to enable you to follow strict security, compliance, and risk management controls for common healthcare use cases. I was also pleased to award a Digital Innovation Workshop to one of our customers in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9CGyYJdXLU">my re:Invent session</a>, and look forward to seeing more customers take advantage of this workshop.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS: The Continuous Innovation Cloud</strong></span><br /> A common thread we see across customers is that continuous innovation from AWS enables their ongoing reinvention. Continuous innovation means that you are always getting a newer, better offering every single day. Sometimes it is in the form of brand new services and capabilities, and sometimes it is happening invisibly, under the covers where your environment just keeps getting better. I invite you to learn more about how you can accelerate your innovation journey with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/new/reinvent/">recently launched AWS services</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloud-migration">AWS best practices</a>. If you are migrating Windows workloads, speak with your AWS sales representative or an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/windows/partner-solutions/">AWS Microsoft Workloads Competency Partner</a> to learn how you can leverage our re:Think for Windows program for credits to start your migration.</p>

<p><strong>Post by <a href="https://twitter.com/mza">Dr. Matt Wood</a><br /> </strong></p> 
<p>Today AWS announced contributions to the milestone 1.0 release of the <a href="http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/get_started/install.html">Apache MXNet</a> deep learning engine including the introduction of a new model-serving capability for MXNet. The new capabilities in MXNet provide the following benefits to users:</p> 
<p>1) <em>MXNet is easier to use</em>: The model server for MXNet is a new capability introduced by AWS, and it packages, runs, and serves deep learning models in seconds with just a few lines of code, making them accessible over the internet via an API endpoint and thus easy to integrate into applications. The 1.0 release also includes an advanced indexing capability that enables users to perform matrix operations in a more intuitive manner.</p> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em"><strong>Model Serving enables set up of an API endpoint for prediction: </strong>It saves developers time and effort by condensing the task of setting up an API endpoint for running and integrating prediction functionality into an application to just a few lines of code. It bridges the barrier between Python-based deep learning frameworks and production systems through a Docker container-based deployment model.</li> 
<li><strong>Advanced indexing for array operations in MXNet: </strong>It is now more intuitive for developers to leverage the powerful array operations in MXNet. They can use the advanced indexing capability by leveraging existing knowledge of <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a>/<a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> arrays. For example, it supports MXNet NDArray and Numpy ndarray as index, e.g. (<code>a[mx.nd.array([1,2], dtype = ‘int32’]</code>).</li> 
<p>2) <em>MXNet is faster</em>: The 1.0 release includes implementation of cutting-edge features that optimize the performance of training and inference. Gradient compression enables users to train models up to five times faster by reducing communication bandwidth between compute nodes without loss in convergence rate or accuracy. For speech recognition acoustic modeling like the Alexa voice, this feature can reduce network bandwidth by up to three orders of magnitude during training. With the support of <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl">NVIDIA Collective Communication Library</a> (NCCL), users can train a model 20% faster on multi-GPU systems.</p> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em"><strong>Optimize network bandwidth with gradient compression: </strong>In distributed training, each machine must communicate frequently with others to update the weight-vectors and thereby collectively build a single model, leading to high network traffic. Gradient compression algorithm enables users to train models up to five times faster by compressing the model changes communicated by each instance.</li> 
<li><strong>Optimize the training performance by taking advantage of NCCL: </strong>NCCL implements multi-GPU and multi-node collective communication primitives that are performance optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. NCCL provides communication routines that are optimized to achieve high bandwidth over interconnection between multi-GPUs. MXNet supports NCCL to train models about 20% faster on multi-GPU systems.</li> 
<p>3) <em>MXNet provides easy interoperability</em>: MXNet now includes a tool for converting neural network code written with the Caffe framework to MXNet code, making it easier for users to take advantage of MXNet’s scalability and performance.</p> 
<li><strong>Migrate Caffe models to MXNet: </strong>It is now possible to easily migrate Caffe code to MXNet, using the new source code translation tool for converting Caffe code to MXNet code.</li> 
<p>MXNet has helped developers and researchers make progress with everything from language translation to autonomous vehicles and behavioral biometric security. We are excited to see the broad base of users that are building production artificial intelligence applications powered by neural network models developed and trained with MXNet. For example, the autonomous driving company <a href="http://www.tusimple.com/index-en.html">TuSimple</a> recently piloted a self-driving truck on a 200-mile journey from Yuma, Arizona to San Diego, California using MXNet. This release also includes a full-featured and performance optimized version of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-gluon-a-new-library-for-machine-learning-from-aws-and-microsoft/">Gluon</a> programming interface. The ease-of-use associated with it combined with the extensive set of tutorials has led significant adoption among developers new to deep learning. The flexibility of the interface has driven interest within the research community, especially in the natural language processing domain.</p> 
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Getting started with MXNet</span></strong><br /> Getting started with <a href="http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/install/index.html">MXNet</a>&nbsp;is simple. To learn more about the Gluon interface and deep learning, you can reference this <a href="http://gluon.mxnet.io/">comprehensive set of tutorials</a>, which covers everything from an introduction to deep learning to how to implement cutting-edge neural network models. If you’re a contributor to a machine learning framework, check out the interface specs on <a href="https://github.com/gluon-api/gluon-api/">GitHub</a>.</p> 
<p>To get started with the Model Server for Apache MXNet, install the library with the following command:</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ pip install mxnet-model-server</code></pre> 
<p>The Model Server library has a Model Zoo with 10 pre-trained deep learning models, including the <a href="https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet">SqueezeNet</a> 1.1 object classification model. You can start serving the SqueezeNet model with just the following command:</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ mxnet-model-server \
--models squeezenet=https://s3.amazonaws.com/model-server/models/squeezenet_v1.1/squeezenet_v1.1.model \
--service dms/model_service/mxnet_vision_service.py</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/" title="">Serverless</a> applications have become mainstream more quickly than I ever could have imagined. Every second of every day, countless <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> functions spring to life on an as-needed basis, take care of some critical business function, and then finish up. Our users tell us that they love the flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of this model.</p> 
<p>We want to make sure that every AWS customer moves ahead into the serverless future. After the launch of Lambda, we followed up with the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model">Serverless Application Model</a> (SAM) to further simplify the process of deploying and managing serverless applications on AWS. We have also published serverless reference architectures for <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-webapp">web apps</a>, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-mobilebackend">mobile backends</a>, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-imagerecognition">image recognition &amp; processing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-fileprocessing">real-time file processing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-iotbackend">IoT</a>, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-mapreduce">MapReduce</a>, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-streamprocessing">real-time stream processing</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-imagemoderationchatbot">image moderation for chatbots</a>.</p> 
<p>Today I would like to tell you about the next step forward. We want to make it as easy as possible for AWS customers to discover and deploy serverless apps. We also want to strengthen the open source community around Lambda, SAM, and serverless apps, with room for everyone to share, participate, and benefit.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS Serverless Application Repository</strong></span><br /> <img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/sar_box_1.png">AWS Serverless Application Repository</a>. Designed for producers and consumers of serverless apps, this AWS Console component supports publishing, discovery, and deployment.</p> 
<p>Producers (developers, ISVs, SaaS providers, and AWS partners) can easily publish to the repository. Apps must be in SAM format, accompanied by a <a href="https://spdx.org/">SPDX</a> license identifier, with options to share globally (for all AWS customers) or privately (with access controls for individuals and teams). Source code and other application components can be stored in <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or another source code repository, and then included via reference; again with control over sharing.</p> 
<p>We’re looking forward to your submission. It will join others in progress from Datadog, Here, Splunk, and SignalFx.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>For Publishers</strong></span><br /> If you are already using SAM to build serverless apps, we’re just about ready to start accepting contributions. As a quick refresher, SAM lets you define <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/apigateway" title="">Amazon API Gateway</a> APIs, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" title="">Amazon DynamoDB</a> tables, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> functions that are triggered by API actions and uploads to S3. Your serverless app can use third-party libraries as long as they are available under an open source license that has been approved by the <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> (OSI). You will be able to use resource-based IAM policies to control access to your app—you can keep it private, grant cross-account access on an extremely selective basis, or make it available publicly.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>For Consumers</strong></span><br /> You will be able to find and start using the apps from the Lambda console:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/sar_find_app_1.png" /></p>

<p>One of the first things you learn when you start programming is that, just like any craftsperson, your tools matter. Notepad.exe isn’t going to cut it. A powerful editor and testing pipeline supercharge your productivity. I still remember learning to use Vim for the first time and being able to zip around systems and complex programs. Do you remember how hard it was to setup all your compilers and dependencies on a new machine? How many cycles have you wasted matching versions, tinkering with configs, and then writing documentation to onboard a new developer to a project?</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/24/cloud9_console-1.png" /></p> 
<p>Today we’re launching <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">AWS Cloud9</a>, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing, running, and debugging code, all from your web browser. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for many popular programming languages (Javascript, Python, PHP, etc.) so you don’t have to tinker with installing various compilers and toolchains. Cloud9 also provides a seamless experience for working with serverless applications allowing you to quickly switch between local and remote testing or debugging. Based on the popular open source <a href="https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace">Ace Editor</a> and c9.io IDE (which we acquired last year), AWS Cloud9 is designed to make collaborative cloud development easy with extremely powerful pair programming features. There are more features than I could ever cover in this post but to give a quick breakdown I’ll break the IDE into 3 components: The editor, the AWS integrations, and the collaboration.</p> 
<b>Editing</b> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/24/cloud9_editor-1.png" /><br /> The Ace Editor at the core of Cloud9 is what lets you write code quickly, easily, and beautifully. It follows a UNIX philosophy of doing one thing and doing it well: writing code.</p> 
<p>It has all the typical IDE features you would expect: live syntax checking, auto-indent, auto-completion, code folding, split panes, version control integration, multiple cursors and selections, and it also has a few unique features I want to highlight. First of all, it’s fast, even for large (100000+ line) files. There’s no lag or other issues while typing. It has over two dozen themes built-in (solarized!) and you can bring all of your favorite themes from Sublime Text or TextMate as well. It has built-in support for 40+ language modes and customizable run configurations for your projects. Most importantly though, <b>it has Vim mode</b> (or emacs if your fingers work that way). It also has a keybinding editor that allows you to bend the editor to your will.</p> 
<p>The editor supports powerful keyboard navigation and commands (similar to Sublime Text or vim plugins like <a href="https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a>). On a Mac, with <code>⌘+P</code> you can open any file in your environment with fuzzy search. With <code>⌘+.</code> you can open up the command pane which allows you to do invoke any of the editor commands by typing the name. It also helpfully displays the keybindings for a command in the pane, for instance to open to a terminal you can press <code>⌥+T</code>. Oh, did I mention there’s a terminal? It ships with the AWS CLI preconfigured for access to your resources.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/24/cloud9_terminal_1-1.png" /></p> 
<p>The environment also comes with pre-installed debugging tools for many popular languages – but you’re not limited to what’s already installed. It’s easy to add in new programs and define new run configurations.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/23/cloud9_debug_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The editor is just one, admittedly important, component in an IDE though. I want to show you some other compelling features.</p> 
<b>AWS Integrations</b> 
<p>The AWS Cloud9 IDE is the first IDE I’ve used that is truly “cloud native”. The service is provided at no additional charge, and you only charged for the underlying compute and storage resources. When you create an environment you’re prompted for either: an instance type and an auto-hibernate time, or SSH access to a machine of your choice.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/22/cloud9_create_environment.png" /></p> 
<p>If you’re running in AWS the auto-hibernate feature will stop your instance shortly after you stop using your IDE. This can be a huge cost savings over running a more permanent developer desktop. You can also launch it within a VPC to give it secure access to your development resources. If you want to run Cloud9 outside of AWS, or on an existing instance, you can provide SSH access to the service which it will use to create an environment on the external machine. Your environment is provisioned with automatic and secure access to your AWS account so you don’t have to worry about copying credentials around. Let me say that again: you can run this anywhere.</p> 
<h3>Serverless Development with AWS Cloud9</h3> 
<p>I spend a lot of time on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/aws">Twitch</a> developing serverless applications. I have hundreds of lambda functions and APIs deployed. Cloud9 makes working with every single one of these functions delightful. Let me show you how it works.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/24/cloud9_lambda_functions-1.png" /><br /> If you look in the top right side of the editor you’ll see an AWS Resources tab. Opening this you can see all of the lambda functions in your region (you can see functions in other regions by adjusting your region preferences in the AWS preference pane).</p> 
<p>You can import these remote functions to your local workspace just by double-clicking them. This allows you to edit, test, and debug your serverless applications all locally. You can create new applications and functions easily as well. If you click the Lambda icon in the top right of the pane you’ll be prompted to create a new lambda function and Cloud9 will automatically create a <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model" title="Serverless Application Model - SAM">Serverless Application Model</a> template for you as well. The IDE ships with support for the popular <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-local">SAM local</a> tool pre-installed. This is what I use in most of my local testing and serverless development. Since you have a terminal, it’s easy to install additional tools and use other serverless frameworks.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>Launching an Environment from AWS CodeStar</h3> 
<p>With <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codestar/" title="AWS CodeStar">AWS CodeStar</a> you can easily provision an end-to-end continuous delivery toolchain for development on AWS. Codestar provides a unified experience for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications using AWS CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, and CodeDeploy suite of services. Now, with a few simple clicks you can provision a Cloud9 environment to develop your application. Your environment will be pre-configured with the code for your CodeStar application already checked out and git credentials already configured.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/23/codestar_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You can easily share this environment with your coworkers which leads me to another extremely useful set of features.</p> 
<b>Collaboration</b> 
<p>One of the many things that sets AWS Cloud9 apart from other editors are the rich collaboration tools. You can invite an IAM user to your environment with a few clicks.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/23/cloud9_share_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You can see what files they’re working on, where their cursors are, and even share a terminal. The chat features is useful as well.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/22/cloud9_collab-1.png" /></p> 
<h3>Things to Know</h3> 
<li>There are no additional charges for this service beyond the underlying compute and storage.</li> 
<li><a href="https://c9.io">c9.io</a> continues to run for existing users. You can continue to use all the features of c9.io and add new team members if you have a team account. In the future, we will provide tools for easy migration of your c9.io workspaces to AWS Cloud9.</li> 
<li>AWS Cloud9 is available in the US West (Oregon), US East (Ohio), US East (N.Virginia), EU (Ireland), and Asia Pacific (Singapore) regions.</li> 
<p>I can’t wait to see what you build with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">AWS Cloud9</a>!</p>

<p>There are only a few things more integrated into my day-to-day life than Alexa. I use my Echo device and the enabled Alexa Skills for turning on lights in my home, checking video from my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J24C0TI">Echo Show </a>to see who is ringing my doorbell, keeping track of my extensive to-do list on a weekly basis, playing music, and lots more. I even have my family members enabling Alexa skills on their Echo devices for all types of activities that they now cannot seem to live without. My mother, who is in a much older generation (<em>please don’t tell her I said that</em>), uses her Echo and the custom Alexa skill I built for her to store her baking recipes. She also enjoys exploring skills that have the latest health and epicurean information. It’s no wonder then, that when I go to work I feel like something is missing. For example, I would love to be able to ask Alexa to read my flash briefing when I get to the office.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-1-LOGO-1024x121.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For those of you that would love to have Alexa as your intelligent assistant at work, I have exciting news. I am delighted to announce <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/alexaforbusiness/"><strong>Alexa for Business</strong></a>, a new service that enables businesses and organizations to bring Alexa into the workplace at scale. <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> not only brings Alexa into your workday to boost your productivity, but also provides tools and resources for organizations to set up and manage Alexa devices at scale, enable private skills, and enroll users.</p> 
<p><strong><u>Making Workplaces Smarter with Alexa for Business</u></strong></p> 
<p><strong>Alexa for Business</strong> brings the Alexa you know and love into the workplace to help all types of workers to be more productive and organized on both personal and shared Echo devices. In the workplace, shared devices can be placed in common areas for anyone to use, and workers can use their personal devices to connect at work and at home.</p> 
<p><strong>End users</strong> can use shared devices or personal devices. Here’s what they can do from each.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Shared devices</span></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Join meetings in conference rooms: You can simply say “Alexa, start the meeting”. Alexa turns on the video conferencing equipment, dials into your conference call, and gets the meeting going.</li> 
<li>Help around the office: access custom skills to help with directions around the office, finding an open conference room, reporting a building equipment problem, or ordering new supplies.</li> 
</ol> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Personal devices</span></p> 
<ol> 
<li>Enable calling and messaging: Alexa helps make phone calls, hands free and can also send messages on your behalf.</li> 
<li>Automatically dial into conference calls: Alexa can join any meeting with a conference call number via voice from home, work, or on the go.</li> 
<li>Intelligent assistant: Alexa can quickly check calendars, help schedule meetings, manage to-do lists, and set reminders.</li> 
<li>Find information: Alexa can help find information in popular business applications like Salesforce, Concur, or Splunk.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Here are some of the controls available to <strong>administrators</strong>:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Provision &amp; Manage Shared Alexa Devices: You can provision and manage shared devices around your workplace using the <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> console. For each device you can set a location, such as a conference room designation, and assign public and private skills for the device.</li> 
<li>Configure Conference Room Settings: Kick off your meetings with a simple “Alexa, start the meeting.” <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> allows you to configure your conference room settings so you can use Alexa to start your meetings and control your conference room equipment, or dial in directly from the Amazon Echo device in the room.</li> 
<li>Manage Users: You can invite users in your organization to enroll their personal Alexa account with your <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> account. Once your users have enrolled, you can enable your custom private skills for them to use on any of the devices in their personal Alexa account, at work or at home.</li> 
<li>Manage Skills: You can assign public skills and custom private skills your organization has created to your shared devices, and make private skills available to your enrolled users.&nbsp; You can create skills groups, which you can then assign to specific shared devices.</li> 
<li>Build Private Skills &amp; Use <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> APIs:&nbsp; Dig into the Alexa Skills Kit and build your own skills.&nbsp; Then you can make these available to the shared devices and enrolled users in your <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> account, all without having to publish them in the public Alexa Skills Store.&nbsp; <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> offers additional APIs, which you can use to add context to your skills and automate administrative tasks.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Let’s take a quick journey into <strong>Alexa for Business</strong>. I’ll first log into the AWS Console and go to the <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> service.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-2-GETTING-STARTED-1024x505.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Once I log in to the service, I am presented with the <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> dashboard. As you can see, I have access to manage Rooms, Shared devices, Users, and Skills, as well as the ability to control conferencing, calendars, and user invitations.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-3-DASHBOARD-copy.png" /></p> 
<p>First, I’ll start by setting up my Alexa devices. <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> provides a Device Setup Tool to setup multiple devices, connect them to your Wi-Fi network, and register them with your <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> account. This is quite different from the setup process for personal Alexa devices. With <strong>Alexa for Business</strong>, you can provision 25 devices at a time.</p> 
<p>Once my devices are provisioned, I can create location profiles for the locations where I want to put these devices (such as in my conference rooms). We call these locations “Rooms” in our <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> console. I can go to the Room profiles menu and create a Room profile. A Room profile contains common settings for the Alexa device in your room, such as the wake word for the device, the address, time zone, unit of measurement, and whether I want to enable outbound calling.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-4-DEVICE-SETUP-borded.png" /></p> 
<p>The next step is to enable skills for the devices I set up. I can enable any skill from the Alexa Skills store, or use the private skills feature to enable skills I built myself and made available to my <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> account. To enable skills for my shared devices, I can go to the Skills menu option and enable skills. After I have enabled skills, I can add them to a skill group and assign the skill group to my rooms.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-5-SKILLS-1024x426.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-6-CREATE-SKILLS-1024x363.png" /></p> 
<p>Something I really like about <strong>Alexa for Business</strong>, is that I can use Alexa to dial into conference calls. To enable this, I go to the Conferencing menu option and select Add provider. At Amazon we use Amazon Chime, but you can choose from a list of different providers, or you can even add your own provider if you want to.</p> 
<p>Once I’ve set this up, I can say “Alexa, join my meeting”; Alexa asks for my Amazon Chime meeting ID, after which my Echo device will automatically dial into my Amazon Chime meeting. <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> also provides an intelligent way to start any meeting quickly. We’ve all been in the situation where we walk into a meeting room and can’t find the meeting ID or conference call number. With <strong>Alexa for Business</strong>, I can link to my corporate calendar, so Alexa can figure out the meeting information for me, and automatically dial in – I don’t even need my meeting ID. Here’s how you do that:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-7-CONFERENCING-1-1024x462.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-8-ADD-PROVIDER-1024x331.png" /></p> 
<p>Alexa can also control the video conferencing equipment in the room. To do this, all I need to do is select the skill for the equipment that I have, select the equipment provider, and enable it for my conference rooms. Now when I ask Alexa to join my meeting, Alexa will dial-in from the equipment in the room, and turn on the video conferencing system, without me needing to do anything else.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-12-CONFERENCE-HARDWARE-1-1024x280.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Let’s switch to enrolled users next.</strong></p> 
<p>I’ll start by setting up the User Invitation for my organization so that I can invite users to my <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> account. To allow a user to use <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> within an organization, you invite them to enroll their personal Alexa account with the service by sending a user invitation via email from the management console. If I choose, I can customize the user enrollment email to contain additional content. For example, I can add information about my organization’s Alexa skills that can be enabled after they’ve accepted the invitation and completed the enrollment process.&nbsp;My users must join in order to use the features of <strong>Alexa for Business</strong>, such as auto dialing into conference calls, linking their Microsoft Exchange calendars, or using private skills.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/30/IMAGE-9-USER-INVITATIONScorrect-1024x432.png" /></p> 
<p>Now that I have customized my User Invitation, I will invite users to take advantage of <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> for my organization by going to the Users menu on the Dashboard and entering their email address.&nbsp; This will send an email with a link that can be used to join my organization. Users will join using the Amazon account that their personal Alexa devices are registered to. Let’s invite Jeff Barr to join my <strong>Alexa for Business</strong> organization.</p>

<p>Today we’re launching Amazon Time Sync Service, a time synchronization service delivered over Network Time Protocol (NTP) which uses a fleet of redundant satellite-connected and atomic clocks in each region to deliver a highly accurate reference clock. This service is provided at no additional charge and is immediately available in all public AWS regions to all instances running in a VPC.</p> 
<p>You can access the service via the link local 169.254.169.123 IP address. This means you don’t need to configure external internet access and the service can be securely accessed from within your private subnets.</p> 
<b>Setup</b> 
<p><a href="https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/">Chrony</a> is a different implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">NTP</a> than what ntpd uses and it’s able to synchronize the system clock faster and with better accuracy than ntpd. I’d recommend using Chrony unless you have a legacy reason to use ntpd.</p> 
<p>Installing and configuring chrony on Amazon Linux&nbsp;is as simple as:</p> 
<pre><code>
sudo yum erase ntp*
sudo yum -y install chrony
sudo service chrony start
</code></pre> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/21/ntp_console.png" /></p> 
<p>Alternatively, just modify your existing NTP config by adding the line <code>server 169.254.169.123 prefer iburst</code>.</p> 
<p>On Windows you can run the following commands in PowerShell or a command prompt:</p> 
<pre><code>
net stop w32time
w32tm /config /syncfromflags:manual /manualpeerlist:&quot;169.254.169.123&quot;
w32tm /config /reliable:yes
net start w32time
</code></pre> 
<b>Leap Seconds</b> 
<p>Time is hard. Science, and society, measure time with respect to the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF), which is computed using long baseline interferometry of distant quasars, GPS satellite orbits, and laser ranging of the moon (cool!). Irregularities in Earth’s rate of rotation cause UTC to drift from time with respect to the ICRF. To address this clock drift the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems (IERS) occasionally introduce an extra second into UTC to keep it within 0.9 seconds of real time.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/look-before-you-leap-december-31-2016-leap-second-on-aws/">Leap seconds</a> are known to cause application errors and this can be a concern for many savvy developers and systems administrators. The <code>169.254.169.123</code> clock smooths out leap seconds over a period of time (commonly called leap smearing) which makes it easy for your applications to deal with leap seconds.</p> 
<p>This timely update should provide immediate benefits to anyone previously relying on an external time synchronization service.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/low-cost-burstable-ec2-instances/">first wrote about</a> the T2 instances in the summer of 2014, and talked about how many workloads have a modest demand for continuous compute power and an occasional need for a lot more. This model resonated with our customers; the T2 instances are very popular and are now used to host microservices, low-latency interactive applications, virtual desktops, build &amp; staging environments, prototypes, and the like.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t2/"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New T2 Unlimited</strong></span></a><br /> Today we are extending the burst model that we pioneered with the T2, giving you the ability to sustain high CPU performance over any desired time frame while still keeping your costs as low as possible. You simply enable this feature when you launch your instance; you can also enable it for an instance that is already running. The hourly T2 instance price covers all interim spikes in usage if the average CPU utilization is lower than the baseline over a 24-hour window. There’s a small hourly charge if the instance runs at higher CPU utilization for a prolonged period of time. For example, if you run a <strong>t2.micro</strong> instance at an average of 15% utilization (5% above the baseline) for 24 hours you will be charged an additional 6 cents (5 cents per vCPU-hour * 1 vCPU * 5% * 24 hours).</p> 
<p>To launch a T2 Unlimited instance from the EC2 Console, select any T2 instance and then click on<strong> Enable</strong> next to <strong>T2 Unlimited</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/t2_unlimited_launch_2.png" /></p> 
<p>And here’s how to switch a running instance from T2 Standard to T2 Unlimited:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/t2_switch_to_unlimited_2.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Behind the Scenes</strong></span><br /> As I described in my original post, each T2 instance accumulates CPU Credits as it runs and consumes them while it is running at full-core speed, decelerating to a baseline level when the supply of Credits is exhausted. T2 Unlimited instances have the ability to borrow an entire day’s worth of future credits, allowing them to perform additional bursting. This borrowing is tracked by the new <strong>CPUSurplusCreditBalance</strong> CloudWatch metric. When this balance rises to the level where it represents an entire day’s worth of future credits, the instance continues to deliver full-core performance, charged at the rate of $0.05 per vCPU per hour for Linux and $0.096 for Windows. These charged surplus credits are tracked by the new <strong>CPUSurplusCreditsCharged</strong> metric. You will be charged on a per-millisecond basis for partial hours of bursting (further reducing your costs) if you exhaust your surplus late in a given hour.</p> 
<p>The charge for any remaining <strong>CPUSurplusCreditBalance</strong> is processed when the instance is terminated or configured as a T2 Standard. Any accumulated <strong>CPUCreditBalance</strong> carries over during the transition to T2 Standard.</p> 
<p>The T2 Unlimited model is designed to spare you the trouble of watching the CloudWatch metrics, but (if you are like me) you will do it anyway. Let’s take a quick look at a <strong>t2.nano </strong>and watch the credits over time. First, CPU utilization grows to 100% and the instance begins to consume 5 credits every 5 minutes (one credit is equivalent to a VCPU-minute):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/t2u_usage_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The CPU credit balance remains at 0 because the credits are being produced and consumed at the same rate. The surplus credit balance (tracked by the <strong>CPUSurplusCreditBalance</strong> metric) ramps up to 72, representing the credits that are being borrowed from the future:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/t2u_cred_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Once the surplus credit balance hits 72, there’s nothing more to borrow from the future, and any further CPU usage is charged at the end of the hour, tracked with the <strong>CPUSurplusCreditsCharged</strong> metric. The instance consumes 5 credits every 5 minutes and earns 0.25, resulting in a net charge of 4.75 VCPU-minutes for each 5 minutes of bursting:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/t2u_charge_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You can switch each of your instances back and forth between T2 Standard and T2 Unlimited at any time; all credit balances except <strong>CPUSurplusCreditsCharged</strong> remain and are carried over. Because T2 Unlimited instances have the ability to burst at any time, they do not receive the 30 minutes of credits given to newly launched T2 Standard instances. Also, since each AWS account can launch a limited number of T2 Standard instances with initial CPU credits each day, T2 Unlimited instances can be a better fit for use in Auto Scaling Groups and other scenarios where large numbers of instances come and go each day.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/">AWS Systems Manager</a> is a new way to manage your cloud and hybrid IT environments. AWS Systems Manager provides a unified user interface that simplifies resource and application management, shortens the time to detect and resolve operational problems, and makes it easy to operate and manage your infrastructure securely at scale. This service is absolutely packed full of features. It defines a new experience around grouping, visualizing, and reacting to problems using features from products like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/systems-manager/" title="Systems Manager">Amazon EC2 Systems Manager (SSM)</a> to enable rich operations across your resources.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/29/console_first_shot.png" /></p> 
<p>As I said above, there are a lot of powerful features in this service and we won’t be able to dive deep on all of them but it’s easy to go to the console and get started with any of the tools.</p> 
<b>Resource Groupings</b> 
<p>Resource Groups allow you to create logical groupings of most resources that support tagging like: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" title="">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</a> instances, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a> buckets, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing" title="">Elastic Load Balancing</a> balancers, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" title="">Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)</a> instances, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/" title="">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/" title="">Amazon Kinesis</a> streams, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/" title="">Amazon Route 53</a> zones, and more. Previously, you could use the AWS Console to define resource groupings but AWS Systems Manager provides this new resource group experience via a new console and API. These groupings are a fundamental building block of Systems Manager in that they are frequently the target of various operations you may want to perform like: compliance management, software inventories, patching, and other automations.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/26/resource_groups.png" /></p> 
<p>You start by defining a group based on tag filters. From there you can view all of the resources in a centralized console. You would typically use these groupings to differentiate between applications, application layers, and environments like production or dev – but you can make your own rules about how to use them as well. If you imagine a typical 3 tier web-app you might have a few EC2 instances, an ELB, a few S3 buckets, and an RDS instance. You can define a grouping for that application and with all of those different resources simultaneously.</p> 
<b>Insights</b> 
<p>AWS Systems Manager automatically aggregates and displays operational data for each resource group through a dashboard. You no longer need to navigate through multiple AWS consoles to view all of your operational data. You can easily integrate your exiting <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" title="">Amazon CloudWatch</a> dashboards, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/config/" title="">AWS Config</a> rules, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/" title="">AWS CloudTrail</a> trails, AWS Trusted Advisor notifications, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/phd/" title="">AWS Personal Health Dashboard</a> performance and availability alerts. You can also easily view your software inventories across your fleet. AWS Systems Manager also provides a compliance dashboard allowing you to see the state of various security controls and patching operations across your fleets.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/26/inventory_1.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/26/compliance_1.png" /></p> 
<b>Acting on Insights</b> 
<p>Building on the success of EC2 Systems Manager (SSM), AWS Systems Manager takes all of the features of SSM and provides a central place to access them. These are all the same experiences you would have through SSM with a more accesible console and centralized interface. You can use the resource groups you’ve defined in Systems Manager to visualize and act on groups of resources.</p> 
<h3>Automation</h3> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/26/automation_1.png" /><br /> Automations allow you to define common IT tasks as a JSON document that specify a list of tasks. You can also use community published documents. These documents can be executed through the Console, CLIs, SDKs, scheduled maintenance windows, or triggered based on changes in your infrastructure through CloudWatch events. You can track and log the execution of each step in the documents and prompt for additional approvals. It also allows you to incrementally roll out changes and automatically halt when errors occur. You can start executing an automation directly on a resource group and it will be able to apply itself to the resources that it understands within the group.</p> 
<h3>Run Command</h3> 
<p>Run Command is a superior alternative to enabling SSH on your instances. It provides safe, secure remote management of your instances at scale without logging into your servers, replacing the need for SSH bastions or remote powershell. It has granular IAM permissions that allow you to restrict which roles or users can run&nbsp;certain&nbsp;commands.</p> 
<h3>Patch Manager, Maintenance Windows, and State Manager</h3> 
<p>I’ve written about <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ec2-systems-manager-patch-manager-now-supports-linux/">Patch Manager</a> before and if you manage fleets of Windows and Linux instances it’s a great way to maintain a common baseline of security across your fleet.</p> 
<p>Maintenance windows allow you to schedule instance maintenance and other disruptive tasks for a specific time window.</p> 
<p>State Manager allows you to control various server configuration details like anti-virus definitions, firewall settings, and more. You can define policies in the console or run existing scripts, PowerShell modules, or even Ansible playbooks directly from S3 or GitHub. You can query State Manager at any time to view the status of your instance configurations.</p> 
<b>Things To Know</b> 
<p>There’s some interesting terminology here. We haven’t done the best job of naming things in the past so let’s take a moment to clarify. EC2 Systems Manager (sometimes called SSM) is what you used before today. You can still invoke <code>aws ssm</code> commands. However, AWS Systems Manager builds on and enhances many of the tools provided by EC2 Systems Manager and allows those same tools to be applied to more than just EC2. When you see the phrase “Systems Manager” in the future you should think of AWS Systems Manager and not EC2 Systems Manager.</p> 
<p>AWS Systems Manager with all of this useful functionality is provided at no additional charge. It is immediately available in all public AWS regions.</p> 
<p>The best part about these services is that even with their tight integrations each one is designed to be used in isolation as well. If you only need one component of these services it’s simple to get started with only that component.</p> 
<p>There’s a lot more than I could ever document in this post so I encourage you all to jump into the&nbsp;<a href="https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fsystems-manager%2Fhome%3Fstate%3DhashArgs%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue&amp;client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A015428540659%3Auser%2Fssm&amp;forceMobileApp=0">console</a> and<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-systems-manager.html"> documentation</a> to figure out where you can start using AWS Systems Manager.</p>

<p>I was recently reading an article on ReadWrite.com titled “<a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/12/21/iot-devices-increase-200-worldwide-five-years-dl4/">IoT devices go forth and multiply, to increase 200% by 2021</a>“, and while the article noted the benefit for consumers and the industry of this growth, two things in the article stuck with me. The first was the specific statement that read “researchers warned that the proliferation of IoT technology will create a new bevvy of challenges. Particularly troublesome will be IoT deployments at scale for both end-users and providers.” Not only was that sentence a mouthful, but it really addressed some of the challenges that can come building solutions and deployment of this exciting new technology area. The second sentiment in the article that stayed with me was that Security issues could grow.</p> 
<p>So the article got me thinking, how can we create these cool IoT solutions using low-cost efficient microcontrollers with a secure operating system that can easily connect to the cloud. Luckily the answer came to me by way of an exciting new open-source based offering coming from AWS that I am happy to announce to you all today. Let’s all welcome, Amazon&nbsp;FreeRTOS to the technology stage.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/freertos/"><strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong></a> is an IoT microcontroller operating system that&nbsp;simplifies development, security, deployment, and maintenance of microcontroller-based edge devices. Amazon FreeRTOS extends the FreeRTOS kernel, a popular real-time operating system, with libraries that enable local and cloud connectivity, security, and (coming soon) over-the-air updates.</p> 
<p>So what are some of the great benefits of this new exciting offering, you ask. They are as follows:</p> 
<li><strong>Easily to create solutions for Low Power Connected Devices</strong>: provides a common operating system (OS) and libraries that make the development of common IoT capabilities easy for devices. For example; over-the-air (OTA) updates&nbsp;<em>(coming soon)</em> and&nbsp;device configuration.</li> 
<li><strong>Secure Data and Device Connections:&nbsp;</strong>devices only run trusted software using the Code Signing service, Amazon FreeRTOS provides a secure connection to the AWS using TLS, as well as, the ability to securely store keys and sensitive data on the device.</li> 
<li><strong>Extensive Ecosystem:&nbsp;</strong>contains an&nbsp;extensive hardware and technology ecosystem that allows you to choose a variety of qualified chipsets, including Texas Instruments, Microchip, NXP Semiconductors, and STMicroelectronics.</li> 
<li><strong>Cloud or Local Connections:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Devices can connect directly to the AWS Cloud or via <strong>AWS Greengrass</strong>.</li> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span style="color: #3366ff"><strong>What’s cool is that it is easy to get started.</strong>&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p>The <strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong> console allows you to select and download the software that you need for your solution.</p> 
<p>There is a Qualification Program that helps to assure you that the microcontroller you choose will run consistently across several hardware options.</p> 
<p>Finally, <strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong> kernel is an open-source FreeRTOS operating system that is freely available on GitHub for download.</p> 
<p>But I couldn’t leave you without at least showing you a few snapshots of the <strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong> Console.</p> 
<p>Within the <strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong> Console, I can select a predefined software configuration that I would like to use.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AmazonFreeRTOS-02-NewSoftwareConfig1.png" /></p> 
<p>If I want to have a more customized software configuration, <strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong> allows you to customize a solution that is targeted for your use by adding or removing libraries.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AmazonFreeRTOS-01-NewSoftwareConfig.png" /></p> 
<p><strong><u>Summary</u></strong></p> 
<p>Thanks for checking out the new <strong>Amazon FreeRTOS&nbsp;</strong>offering. To learn more go to the&nbsp;<strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/freertos/">product page</a> or review the information provided about this exciting IoT device targeted operating system in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/freertos/">AWS documentation</a>.</p>
