Quick Start Update: Deploy Magento on the AWS Cloud with Amazon Aurora</a>
</b>
<p>
Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 6, 2017</span>
</p>
<p>                    AWS is pleased to release a major update to the Magento Quick Start reference deployment. This update adds support for Amazon Aurora as a relational database option, deployed using Amazon Relational Database System (Amazon RDS), in addition to Amazon RDS MySQL. The Quick Start also includes enhancements to the networking infrastructure through the deployment of Linux bastion hosts.</p>
<p>                    Magento is an open-source content management system for e-commerce websites. The Quick Start automatically deploys and configures Magento Open Source (formerly Community Edition) 2.1.x in a highly available architecture on the AWS Cloud, using AWS services such as Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS), Amazon ElastiCache, and Amazon RDS. This automated deployment builds a cluster that runs Magento along with optional sample data.</p>
<p>The AWS CloudFormation templates included in the Quick Start support two customizable deployment options: end-to-end deployment into a new virtual private cloud (VPC), and deployment into your existing AWS infrastructure. Deployment takes approximately 30-60 minutes, depending on whether you choose to include sample data. You can also use the templates as a starting point for your own implementation, by downloading them from the <a href="https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-magento">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>To try out the updated Magento Quick Start, use the following resources:<br />
-	View <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/magento/">architecture and details</a><br />
-	View the deployment guide — <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstart/latest/magento/">HTML</a> | <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-reference/magento/latest/doc/Magento_on_the_AWS_Cloud.pdf">PDF</a><br />

<p><i>                    About Quick Starts</i></p>
<p><i>  Quick Starts are automated reference deployments for key workloads on the AWS Cloud. Each Quick Start launches, configures, and runs the AWS compute, network, storage, and other services required to deploy a specific workload on AWS, using AWS best practices for security and availability. </i></p>

</p>
<p>You can now use Apache Livy (0.4) and new versions of Hue (4.0.1), <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/emr/details/presto/">Presto (0.184)</a>, Flink (1.3.2) and Apache Pig (0.17) on Amazon EMR release 5.9.0. <a href="https://livy.incubator.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Livy</a> is an application that enables you to submit, interact with, and manage Apache Spark applications over a REST interface. <a href="http://gethue.com/hue-4-and-its-new-interface-is-out/" target="_blank">Hue 4.0.1</a> includes a redesigned interface and new SQL editor, interactive Spark notebook, and an improved job browser UI. Also, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/emr/details/spark/">Apache Spark</a> on release 5.9.0 now uses SSL instead of 3DES for in-transit encryption for the block transfer service, giving performance enhancements when using Amazon EC2 instance types with AES-NI. Additionally, we have added several enhancements to Spark to improve resilience and performance during Auto Scaling.</p>
<p>You can create an Amazon EMR cluster with release 5.9.0 by choosing release label “emr-5.9.0” from the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDK. You can select Livy, Hue, Presto, and Pig to install these applications on your cluster.

</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dms/">AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)</a> has added Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and Azure SQL Database as migration sources. Amazon S3 is object storage with a simple web interface to store and retrieve any amount of data. Now that S3 is supported as both a source and a target, you can easily move your data between S3 buckets and any database supported by DMS.</p>
<p>                    Building on its existing support for SQL Server sources and targets, DMS now supports full load from Azure SQL Database instances. Information can be migrated from an Azure SQL Database instance to a SQL Server database running on Amazon EC2 or Amazon RDS, or to an open source database or any other target supported by DMS. This opens up both cloud vendor mobility and database mobility.</p>
<p>                    For more information about AWS Database Migration Service, please visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dms/">product page</a> or the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/dms/">documentation</a>.

<p>Amazon EC2 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/10/announcing-amazon-ec2-per-second-billing/">recently</a> transitioned from hourly to per-second billing. Previously, as your jobs completed, AWS Batch would retain idle compute resources for the majority of the billing hour in order to avoid the cost associated with additional instance launches within the hour. With per-second billing, AWS customers are able to focus on their applications instead of maximizing usage to the hour. As a result, AWS Batch will now evaluate compute resources more frequently and immediately scale down any idle instances when there are no more runnable jobs in your job queues.</p>
<p>This change is effective today in the US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon),  EU (Ireland), EU (London), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Singapore),  Asia Pacific (Tokyo), and Asia Pacific (Sydney) AWS Regions and will be  effective in US East (N. Virginia) next week.</p>
<p>AWS Batch is currently available in the following regions:</p>
<ul>
<li>US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1</li>
<li>US East (Ohio) us-east-2</li>
<li>US West (Oregon) us-west-2</li>
<li>EU (Ireland) eu-west-1</li>

<p>                    You can now configure your <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/analytics/">Amazon Kinesis Analytics</a> applications to transform data before it is processed by your SQL code. This new feature allows you to use AWS Lambda to convert formats, enrich data, filter data, and more. Once the data is transformed by your function, Kinesis Analytics sends the data to your application’s SQL code for real-time analytics. </p>
<p>To get started, simply select an AWS Lambda function from the Kinesis Analytics application source page in the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/">AWS Management console</a>. Your Kinesis Analytics application will automatically process your raw data records using the Lambda function, and send transformed data to your SQL code for further processing.</p>
<p>Kinesis Analytics provides Lambda blueprints for common use cases like converting GZIP and Kinesis Producer Library formats to JSON. You can use these blueprints without any change or write your own custom functions. For an example of this feature see the blog post <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/preprocessing-data-in-amazon-kinesis-analytics-with-aws-lambda/">Pre-processing data in Kinesis Analytics with AWS Lambda</a>.

Use New Quick Start to Deploy a SaaS Identity and Isolation Solution with Amazon Cognito in the AWS Cloud</a>
</b>
<p>
Posted On: <span class="date">Oct 4, 2017</span>
</p>
<p>This Quick Start provides the fundamentals for implementing identity and isolation in multi-tenant software as a service (SaaS) environments, using Amazon Cognito as the underlying identity provider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Quick Start introduces core concepts and best practices that you can use in your own SaaS applications. It includes a lightweight SaaS order management system that illustrates different aspects of identity and isolation, spanning the system and tenant roles in a multi-tenant environment.</p>
<p>The Quick Start uses claims to represent attributes that associate tenant information with each user. These claims are packaged and transported in an encoded JSON Web Token (JWT), and include a standard set of attributes that are supported by the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol. In addition, the Quick Start supports custom attributes, which are conveyed as custom claims in the JWT returned by the authentication process. The custom attributes are provisioned and configured when each tenant is onboarded to the system.</p>
<p>The Quick Start architecture includes AWS services such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Cognito, for user and identity management</li>
<li>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), to manage isolation policies and roles</li>
<li>AWS Lambda, to implement a custom authorizer for validating system tokens</li>
<li>Amazon API Gateway, to provide access to the microservices that support the reference application</li>
<li>Amazon EC2 Container Service (Amazon ECS), to host containers for running microservices</li>
<li>Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), to serve content for the reference application</li>
<li>Amazon DynamoDB, to provide storage for microservices</li>
</ul>
<p>The deployment and configuration tasks are automated by AWS CloudFormation templates that you can customize during launch. You can also use the templates as a starting point for your own implementation, by downloading them from the <a href="https://github.com/aws-quickstart/saas-identity-cognito">GitHub repository</a>. The Quick Start includes a guide that explains core SaaS identity and isolation concepts and implementation details, and includes step-by-step deployment and configuration instructions.</p>

</p>
<p>                    We are excited to announce that Amazon EC2 usage of Linux based instances that are launched in On-Demand, Reserved and Spot form will be billed on one second increments, with a minimum of 60 seconds. </p>
<p>                    Amazon EC2 Elastic GPUs and Amazon EBS volumes will also move from per hour billing to per second billing with a minimum of 60 seconds. As with EC2 instances, the list prices will continue to be displayed as it is today in GB-month for capacity, IOPS-month provisioned for io1 IOPS and per Million I/O requests for Magnetic IOPS.</p>
<p>                    Today, customers may have use cases that require large number of instances running for irregular periods of time, such as dev/test, data processing, analytics, batch processing, image rendering and gaming applications. To improve flexibility and allow customers to focus on their application instead of maximizing usage to the hour, with EC2 per second billing, customers can start, stop, and terminate EC2 instances and take comfort in the fact that their EC2 resources will not be charged for the minutes and seconds remaining in the hours their instances were running.</p>
<p>                    This change is effective in all AWS Regions and is effective immediately, for Linux instances that are newly launched or already running. Per-second billing is not currently applicable to instances running Microsoft Windows or Linux distributions that have a separate hourly charge. </p>
<p>                    List prices and Spot Market prices are still listed on a per-hour basis, but bills are calculated down to the second. With Reserved Instances usage you can launch, use, and terminate multiple instances within an hour and get the Reserved Instance Benefit for all of the instances. Bills will now show times in decimal form instead of in minutes and seconds. </p>
<p>                    Dedicated Instances, EBS Snapshots, and products in AWS Marketplace are still billed on an hourly basis. &nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>                    Today we are releasing enhancements to the AWS Lambda console that make it easier to create, configure, and test Lambda functions. You can now save up to ten test events for each Lambda function. You can access these saved test events from any machine or browser using the console. Previously, you were limited to only one saved test event per account, and you needed to use the same browser on the same machine in order to access the saved test event. </p>
<p>The enhanced console also lets you create new functions more quickly. When creating a new function, you now only need to supply the function name and the execution role. The new console also groups relevant function settings together so that you can easily find the setting you want to configure.

<p>                    Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) now allows customers to expand their VPCs by adding secondary IPv4 address ranges (CIDRs) to their VPCs. Customers can add the secondary CIDR blocks to the VPC directly from the console or by using the CLI after they have created the VPC with the primary CIDR block. Similar to the primary CIDR block, secondary CIDR blocks are also supported by all the AWS services including Elastic Load Balancing and NAT Gateway.</p>
<p>                    This feature has two key benefits. First, customers, who are launching more and more resources in their VPCs, can now scale up their VPCs on-demand. Second, customers no longer have to over-allocate private IPv4 space to their VPCs - they can allocate only what is required at the time, and later expand it as needed. With these benefits, this feature can make it significantly easier for customers to manage their private IPv4 address space.</p>
<p>                    There is no additional charge to use this feature. This feature is available in all AWS regions, including AWS China (Beijing) region operated by Sinnet and AWS GovCloud (US).</p>
<p>                    For more information about this feature and Amazon VPC, visit our <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html#vpc-resize">VPC Documentation page</a>.</p>
