<p>My colleague Deepak Singh has a lot to say about containers!</p> 
<p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffbarr">Jeff</a>;</p> 
<hr /> 
<p>We have a lot of AWS customers who run Kubernetes on AWS. In fact, according to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, 63% of Kubernetes workloads run on AWS. While AWS is a popular place to run Kubernetes, there’s still a lot of manual configuration that customers need to manage their Kubernetes clusters. You have to install and operate the Kubernetes master and configure a cluster of Kubernetes workers. In order to achieve high availability in you Kubernetes clusters, you have to run at least three Kubernetes masters across different AZs. Each master needs to be configured to talk to each, reliably share information, load balance, and failover to the other masters if one experiences a failure. Then once you have it all set up and running you still have to deal with upgrades and patches of the masters and workers software. This all requires a good deal of operational expertise and effort, and customers asked us to make this easier.</p> 
<p><strong>Introducing Amazon EKS</strong><br /> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/">Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS)</a> is a fully managed service that makes it easy for you to use <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes </a>on AWS without having to be an expert in managing Kubernetes clusters. There are few things that we think developers will really like about this service. First, Amazon EKS runs the upstream version of the open-source Kubernetes software, so you can use all the existing plugins and tooling from the Kubernetes community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications running on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises datacenters or public clouds. This means that you can easily migrate your Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS with zero code changes. Second, Amazon EKS automatically runs K8s with three masters across three AZs to protect against a single point of failure. This multi-AZ architecture delivers resiliency against the loss of an AWS Availability Zone.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/eks_s1_sushi_donut_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Third, Amazon EKS also automatically detects and replaces unhealthy masters, and it provides automated version upgrades and patching for the masters. Last, Amazon EKS is integrated with a number of key AWS features such as Elastic Load Balancing for load distribution, IAM for authentication, Amazon VPC for isolation, AWS PrivateLink for private network access, and AWS CloudTrail for logging.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>How it Works</strong></span><br /> Now, let’s see how some of this works. Amazon EKS integrates IAM authentication with Kubernetes RBAC (the native role based access control system for Kubernetes) through a collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/heptio/authenticator">Heptio</a>.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/eks_sticker_donut_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You can assign RBAC roles directly to each IAM entity allowing you to granularly control access permissions to your Kubernetes masters. This allows you to easily manage your Kubernetes clusters using standard Kubernetes tools, such as <strong>kubectl</strong>.</p> 
<p>You can also use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-privatelink-endpoints-kinesis-ec2-systems-manager-and-elb-apis-in-your-vpc/">PrivateLink</a> if you want to access your Kubernetes masters directly from your own Amazon VPC. With PrivateLink, your Kubernetes masters and the Amazon EKS service endpoint appear as an elastic network interface with private IP addresses in your Amazon VPC.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/eks_mmmmm_donuts_1.png" /></p> 
<p>This allows you to access the Kubernetes masters and the Amazon EKS service directly from within your own Amazon VPC, without using public IP addresses or requiring the traffic to traverse the internet.</p> 
<p>Finally, we also built an open source <a href="https://github.com/aws/amazon-vpc-cni-k8s/">CNI plugin</a> that anyone can use with their Kubernetes clusters on AWS. This allows you to natively use Amazon VPC networking with your Kubernetes pods.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/eks_eat_my_donuts_now_1.png" /></p> 
<p>With Amazon EKS, launching a Kubernetes cluster is as easy as a few clicks in the AWS Management Console. Amazon EKS handles the rest, the upgrades, patching, and high availability. Amazon EKS is available in <a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/amazon-eks-preview.html">Preview</a>. We look forward to hearing your feedback.</p>

<p>Containers are&nbsp;a powerful way for developers to develop, package, and deploy their applications. At AWS we have over a hundred thousand active ECS clusters and hundreds of millions of new containers started each week. That’s 400+% customer growth since 2016. Container orchestration solutions, like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" title="">Amazon ECS</a> and Kubernetes make it easier to deploy, manage, and scale these container workloads increasing your agility. However, with each of these&nbsp;container management solutions you’re still responsible for the availability, capacity, and maintenance of the underlying infrastructure. At AWS we saw this as an opportunity to remove some undifferentiated heavy lifting. We want to let you take full advantage of the speed, agility, and immutability that containers offer so you can focus on building your applications rather than managing your infrastructure.</p> 
<b>AWS Fargate</b> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">AWS Fargate</a> is an easy way to deploy your containers on AWS. To put it simply, Fargate is like EC2 but instead of giving you a virtual machine you get a container. It’s a technology that allows you to use containers as a fundamental compute primitive without having to manage the underlying instances. All you need to do is build your container image, specify the CPU and memory requirements, define your networking and IAM policies, and launch. With Fargate, you have flexible configuration options to closely match your application needs and you’re billed with per-second granularity.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/29/Picture1.png" /></p> 
<p>The best part? You can still use all of the same ECS primitives, APIs, and AWS integrations. Fargate provides native integrations with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/" title="">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/" title="">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" title="">Amazon CloudWatch</a> and load balancers. Fargate tasks use the AWSVPC networking mode and provision an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) in your VPC to communicate securely with your resources. With the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a> launching a Fargate task is simple.</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">aws ecs run-task --launch-type FARGATE --cluster BlogCluster --task-definition blog --network-configuration &quot;awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[subnet-b563fcd3]}&quot;</code> 
<p>It’s also easy to use the console to create task definitions and run tasks with the Fargate launch type.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/28/fargate_2.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/28/fargate_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Once we’ve launched a few tasks we can see them running in our cluster:<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/29/fargate.png" /></p> 
<p>You’ll notice that ECS clusters are heterogeneous. They can contain tasks running in Fargate and on EC2.</p> 
<p>If we dive a little deeper and look at a task we can see some useful information including the ENI that&nbsp;Fargate provisioned in our VPC and all of the containers used by that task.&nbsp;The logs tab gives me easy access to my CloudWatch Logs for that task as well.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/29/fargate_4.jpg" /></p> 
<p>Let’s take a look at&nbsp;the configuration options and pricing details for Fargate.</p> 
<h3>Pricing</h3> 
<p>AWS Fargate uses an on-demand pricing model. You pay per per-second for the amount of vCPU and memory resources consumed by your applications. Price per vCPU is $0.0506 per hour and per GB memory is $0.0127 per hour. With Fargate you have 50 configuration options for vCPU and Memory to support a wide range of workloads. The configuration options are below.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<table> 
<tbody> 
<tr> 
<th>CPU (vCPU)</th> 
<th>Memory Values (GB)</th> 
</tr> 
<tr> 
<td>0.25</td> 
<td>0.5, 1, 2</td> 
</tr> 
<tr> 
<td>0.5</td> 
<td>1, 2, 3</td> 
</tr> 
<tr> 
<td>1</td> 
<td>Min. 2GB and Max. 8GB, in 1GB increments</td> 
</tr> 
<tr> 
<td>2</td> 
<td>Min. 4GB and Max. 16GB, in 1GB increments</td> 
</tr> 
<tr> 
<td>4</td> 
<td>Min. 8GB and Max. 30GB in 1GB increments</td> 
</tr> 
</tbody> 
</table> 
<h3>Things To Know</h3> 
<li>You can configure Fargate to closely meet your application’s resource requirements and pay only for resources required by your containers. You can launch tens or tens of thousands of containers in seconds.</li> 
<li>Fargate tasks&nbsp;run&nbsp;similarly to&nbsp;tasks running on EC2. You can add them to VPCs, configure load balancers, and assign IAM roles.</li> 
<h3>On the Roadmap</h3> 
<p>I won’t spill all the beans, but we have a really exciting roadmap for AWS Fargate. I will tell you that we plan to support launching containers on Fargate using Amazon EKS in 2018. As always, we love your feedback. Please leave a note in the <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=187">Amazon ECS forum</a> letting us know what you think.</p> 
<p>Fargate is available today in the US East (Northern Virginia) region.</p>

<p>I always advise new EC2 users to start with our general-purpose instances, run some stress tests, and to get a really good feel for the compute, memory, and networking profile of their application before taking a look at other <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">instance types</a>. With a broad selection of instances optimized for compute, memory, and storage, our customers have many options and the flexibility to choose the instance type that is the best fit for their needs.</p> 
<p>As you can see from my <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-instance-history/">EC2 Instance History</a> post, the general-purpose (M) instances go all the way back to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon_ec2_beta/">2006</a> when we launched the <strong>m1.small</strong>. We continued to evolve along this branch of our family tree, launching the the M2 (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/two-new-ec2-instance-types-additional-memory/">2009</a>), M3 (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-update-new-m3-features-reduced-ebs-prices-reduced-s3-prices/">2012</a>), and the M4 (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/the-new-m4-instance-type-bonus-price-reduction-on-m3-c4/">2015</a>) instances. Our customers use the general-purpose instances to run web &amp; app servers, host enterprise applications, support online games, and build cache fleets.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New M5 Instances</strong></span><br /> Today we are taking the next step forward with the launch of our new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m5/">M5 instances</a>. These instances benefit from our commitment to continued innovation and offer even better price-performance than their predecessors. Based on Custom Intel<sup>&reg;</sup> Xeon<sup>&reg;</sup> Platinum 8175M series processors running at 2.5 GHz, the M5 instances are designed for highly demanding workloads and will deliver 14% better price/performance than the M4 instances on a per-core basis. Applications that use the AVX-512 instructions will crank out twice as many FLOPS per core. We’ve also added a new size at the high-end, giving you even more options.</p> 
<p>Here are the M5 instances (all VPC-only, HVM-only, and EBS-Optimized):</p>

</tbody> 
</table> 
<p>At the top end of the lineup, the <strong>m5.24xlarge</strong> is second only to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-in-memory-processing-update-instances-with-4-to-16-tb-of-memory-scale-out-sap-hana-to-34-tb/">X</a> instances when it comes to vCPU count, giving you more room to scale up and to consolidate workloads. The instances support <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html">Enhanced Networking</a>, and can deliver up to 25 Gbps when used within a Placement Group.</p> 
<p>In addition to dedicated, EBS-Optimized bandwidth to EBS, access to EBS storage is enhanced by the use of NVMe (you’ll need to install the proper drivers if you are using older AMIs). The combination of more bandwidth and NVMe will increase the amount of data that your M5 instances can chew through.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Launch One Today</strong></span><br /> You can launch M5 instances today in the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, and <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span> Regions in On-Demand and Spot form (Reserved Instances are also available), with additional Regions in the works.</p> 
<p>One quick note: the current NVMe driver is not optimized for high-performance sequential workloads and we don’t recommend the use of M5 instances in conjunction with <strong>sc1</strong> or <strong>st1</strong> volumes. We are aware of this issue and have been working to optimize the driver for this important use case.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">EC2 Spot Instances</a> give you access to spare compute capacity in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" title="">AWS Cloud</a>. Our customers use fleets of Spot Instances to power their <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/scaling-up-tenfold-with-amazon-ec2-spot-instances-may-2017-aws-online-tech-talks">CI/CD environments</a> &amp; traffic generators, host <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/an-ec2-spot-architecture-for-web-applications/">web servers &amp; microservices</a>, <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/cost-effective-rendering-in-the-cloud-with-spot-instances">render movies</a>, and to run many types of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/cost-effective-batch-processing-with-amazon-ec2-spot/">analytics jobs</a>, all at prices that offer significant savings in comparison to On-Demand Instances.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Streamlined Access</strong></span><br /> Today we are introducing a new, streamlined access model for Spot Instances. You simply indicate your desire to use Spot capacity when you launch an instance via the <code><a title="undefined" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html" target="null">RunInstances</a></code> function, the <code><a title="undefined" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html" target="null">run-instances</a></code> command, or the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a> to submit a request that will be fulfilled as long as the capacity is available. With no extra effort on your part you’ll save up to 90% off of the On-Demand price for the instance type, allowing you to boost your overall application throughput by up to 10x for the same budget. The instances that you launch in this way will continue to run until you terminate them or if EC2 needs to reclaim them for On-Demand usage. At that point the instance will be given the usual 2-minute warning and then reclaimed, making this a great fit for applications that are fault-tolerant.</p> 
<p>Unlike the old model which required an understanding of Spot markets, bidding, and calls to a standalone asynchronous API, the new model is synchronous and as easy to use as On-Demand. Your code or your script receives an Instance ID immediately and need not check back to see if the request has been processed and accepted.</p> 
<p>We’ve made this as clean and as simple as possible, with the expectation that it will be easy to modify many current scripts and applications to request and make use of Spot capacity. If you want to exercise additional control over your Spot instance budget, you have the option to specify a maximum price when you make a request for capacity. If you use Spot capacity to power your <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/" title="">Amazon EMR</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" title="">Amazon ECS</a>, or <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/batch" title="">AWS Batch</a> clusters, or if you launch Spot instances by way of a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" title="">AWS CloudFormation</a> template or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling" title="">Auto Scaling</a> Group, you will benefit from this new model without having to make any changes.</p> 
<p>Applications that are built around <code><a title="undefined" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotInstances.html" target="null">RequestSpotInstances</a></code> or <code><a title="undefined" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotFleet.html" target="null">RequestSpotFleet</a></code> will continue to work just fine with no changes. However, you now have the option to make requests that do not include the <code>SpotPrice</code> parameter.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Smooth Price Changes</strong></span><br /> As part of today’s launch we are also changing the way that Spot prices change, moving to a model where prices adjust more gradually, based on longer-term trends in supply and demand. As I mentioned earlier, you will continue to save an average of 70-90% off the On-Demand price, and you will continue to pay the Spot price that’s in effect for the time period your instances are running. Applications built around our Spot Fleet feature will continue to automatically diversify placement of their Spot Instances across the most cost-effective pools based on the configuration you specified when you created the fleet.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Spot in Action</strong></span><br /> To launch a Spot Instance from the command line; simply specify the <strong>Spot</strong> market:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">$ aws ec2 run-instances --instance-market-options '{&quot;MarketType&quot;:&quot;Spot&quot;}' \
--image-id ami-1a2b3c4d --count 1 --instance-type c3.large</code> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Instance Hibernation</strong></span><br /> If you run workloads that keep a lot of state in memory, you will love this new feature!</p> 
<p>You can arrange for instances to save their in-memory state when they are reclaimed, allowing the instances and the applications on them to pick up where they left off when capacity is once again available, just like closing and then opening your laptop. This feature works on C3, C4, and certain sizes of R3, R4, and M4 instances running Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, or Windows Server, and is supported by the EC2 Hibernation Agent.</p> 
<p>The in-memory state is written to the root EBS volume of the instance using space that is set-aside when the instance launches. The private IP address and any Elastic IP Addresses are also preserved across a stop/start cycle.</p>

<p>Threats to your IT infrastructure (AWS accounts &amp; credentials, AWS resources, guest operating systems, and applications) come in all shapes and sizes! The online world can be a treacherous place and we want to make sure that you have the tools, knowledge, and perspective to keep your IT infrastructure safe &amp; sound.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/"></a><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/" title="">Amazon GuardDuty</a> is designed to give you just that. Informed by a multitude of public and AWS-generated data feeds and powered by machine learning, <span title="">GuardDuty</span> analyzes billions of events in pursuit of trends, patterns, and anomalies that are recognizable signs that something is amiss. You can enable it with a click and see the first findings within minutes.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>How it Works</strong></span><br /> <span title="">GuardDuty</span> voraciously consumes multiple data streams, including several threat intelligence feeds, staying aware of malicious IP addresses, devious domains, and more importantly, learning to accurately identify malicious or unauthorized behavior in your AWS accounts. In combination with information gleaned from your VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail Event Logs, and DNS logs, this allows <span title="">GuardDuty</span> to detect many different types of dangerous and mischievous behavior including probes for known vulnerabilities, port scans and probes, and access from unusual locations. On the AWS side, it looks for suspicious AWS account activity such as unauthorized deployments, unusual CloudTrail activity, patterns of access to AWS API functions, and attempts to exceed multiple service limits. <span title="">GuardDuty</span> will also look for compromised EC2 instances talking to malicious entities or services, data exfiltration attempts, and instances that are mining cryptocurrency.</p> 
<p><span title="">GuardDuty</span> operates completely on AWS infrastructure and does not affect the performance or reliability of your workloads. You do not need to install or manage any agents, sensors, or network appliances. This clean, zero-footprint model should appeal to your security team and allow them to green-light the use of <span title="">GuardDuty</span> across all of your AWS accounts.</p> 
<p>Findings are presented to you at one of three levels (low, medium, or high), accompanied by detailed evidence and recommendations for remediation. The findings are also available as Amazon CloudWatch Events; this allows you to use your own <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> functions to automatically remediate specific types of issues. This mechanism also allows you to easily push <span title="">GuardDuty</span> findings into event management systems such as <a href="https://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>, <a href="https://www.sumologic.com/">Sumo Logic</a>, and <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a> and to workflow systems like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a>, <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/">ServiceNow</a>, and <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>A Quick Tour</strong></span><br /> Let’s take a quick tour. I open up the <span title="">GuardDuty</span> Console and click on <strong>Get started</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/gd_con_splash_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I confirm that I want to enable <span title="">GuardDuty</span>. This gives it permission to set up the appropriate <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html">service-linked roles</a> and to analyze my logs by clicking on Enable GuardDuty:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/gd_ready_enable_1.png" /></p> 
<p>My own AWS environment isn’t all that exciting, so I visit the <strong>General Settings</strong> and click on <strong>Generate sample findings</strong> to move ahead. Now I’ve got some intriguing findings:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/gd_sample_findings_2.png" /></p> 
<p>I can click on a finding to learn more:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/gd_sample_ec2_5.png" /></p> 
<p>The magnifying glass icons allow me to create inclusion or exclusion filters for the associated resource, action, or other value. I can filter for all of the findings related to this instance:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/gd_ec2_filter_2.png" /></p> 
<p>I can customize <span title="">GuardDuty</span> by adding lists of trusted IP addresses and lists of malicious IP addresses that are peculiar to my environment:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/gd_add_lists_1.png" /></p> 
<p>After I enable <span title="">GuardDuty</span> in my administrator account, I can invite my other accounts to participate:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/gd_add_acft_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Once the accounts decide to participate, <span title="">GuardDuty</span> will arrange for their findings to be shared with the administrator account.</p> 
<p>I’ve barely scratched the surface of <span title="">GuardDuty</span> in the limited space and time that I have. You can try it out at no charge for 30 days; after that you pay based on the number of entries it processes from your VPC Flow, CloudTrail, and DNS logs.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/" title="">Amazon GuardDuty</a> is available in production form in the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span>, <span title="">US East (Ohio)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, <span title="">US West (Northern California)</span>, <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span>, <span title="">EU (Frankfurt)</span>, <span title="">EU (London)</span>, <span title="">South America (S&atilde;o Paulo)</span>, <span title="">Canada (Central)</span>, <span title="">Asia Pacific (Tokyo)</span>, <span title="">Asia Pacific (Seoul)</span>, <span title="">Asia Pacific (Singapore)</span>, <span title="">Asia Pacific (Sydney)</span>, and <span title="">Asia Pacific (Mumbai)</span> Regions and you can start using it today!</p>

<p>When customers come to us with new and unique requirements for AWS, we listen closely, ask lots of questions, and do our best to understand and address their needs. When we do this, we make the resulting service or feature generally available; we do not build one-offs or “snowflakes” for individual customers. That model is messy and hard to scale and is not the way we work.</p> 
<p>Instead, every AWS customer has access to whatever it is that we build, and everyone benefits. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/vmware-cloud-on-aws-now-available/">VMware Cloud on AWS</a> is a good example of this strategy in action. They told us that they wanted to run their virtualization stack directly on the hardware, within the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" title="">AWS Cloud</a>, giving their customers access to the elasticity, security, and reliability (not to mention the broad array of services) that AWS offers.</p> 
<p>We knew that other customers also had interesting use cases for bare metal hardware and didn’t want to take the performance hit of nested virtualization. They wanted access to the physical resources for applications that take advantage of low-level hardware features such as <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/resource-director-technology.html">performance counters</a> and <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/virtualization/virtualization-technology/intel-virtualization-technology.html">Intel<sup>&reg;</sup> VT</a> that are not always available or fully supported in virtualized environments, and also for applications intended to run directly on the hardware or licensed and supported for use in non-virtualized environments.</p> 
<p>Our multi-year effort to move networking, storage, and other EC2 features out of our virtualization platform and into dedicated hardware was already well underway and provided the perfect foundation for a possible solution. This work, as I described in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-compute-intensive-c5-instances-for-amazon-ec2/">Now Available – Compute-Intensive C5 Instances for Amazon EC2</a>, includes a set of dedicated hardware accelerators.</p> 
<p>Now that we have provided VMware with the bare metal access that they requested, we are doing the same for all AWS customers. I’m really looking forward to seeing what you can do with them!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Bare Metal Instances</strong></span><br /> Today we are launching a public preview the <strong>i3.metal</strong> instance, the first in a series of EC2 instances that offer the best of both worlds, allowing the operating system to run directly on the underlying hardware while still providing access to all of the benefits of the cloud. The instance gives you direct access to the processor and other hardware, and has the following specifications:</p> 
<li><strong>Processing</strong> – Two Intel Xeon E5-2686 v4 processors running at 2.3 GHz, with a total of 36 hyperthreaded cores (72 logical processors).</li> 
<li><strong>Memory</strong> – 512 GiB.</li> 
<li><strong>Storage</strong> – 15.2 terabytes of local, SSD-based NVMe storage.</li> 
<li><strong>Network</strong> – 25 Gbps of ENA-based enhanced networking.</li> 
<p>Bare Metal instances are full-fledged members of the EC2 family and can take advantage of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing" title="">Elastic Load Balancing</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling" title="">Auto Scaling</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" title="">Amazon CloudWatch</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-auto-recovery-for-amazon-ec2/">Auto Recovery</a>, and so forth. They can also access the full suite of AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/">database</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot/">IoT</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mobile/">mobile</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/products/analytics/">analytics</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/">artificial intelligence</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/">security</a> services.</p> 
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Previewing Now</span></strong><br /> We are launching a public preview of the Bare Metal instances today; please <a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/amazon-ec2-bare-metal-instances-preview.html">sign up now</a> if you want to try them out.</p> 
<p>You can now bring your specialized applications or your own stack of virtualized components to AWS and run them on Bare Metal instances. If you are using or thinking about using containers, these instances make a great host for <a href="https://coreos.com/">CoreOS</a>.</p> 
<p>An AMI that works on one of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-compute-intensive-c5-instances-for-amazon-ec2/">new C5 instances</a> should also work on an I3 Bare Metal Instance. It must have the ENA and NVMe drivers, and must be tagged for ENA.</p>

<p>Messaging holds the parts of a distributed application together, while also adding resiliency and enabling the implementation of highly scalable architectures. For example, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/prime-day-2017-powered-by-aws/">earlier this year</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" title="">Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns/" title="">Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)</a> supported the processing of customer orders on Prime Day, collectively processing 40 billion messages at a rate of 10 million per second, with no customer-visible issues.</p> 
<p>SQS and SNS have been used extensively for applications that were born in the cloud. However, many of our larger customers are already making use of open-sourced or commercially-licensed message brokers. Their applications are mission-critical, and so is the messaging that powers them. Our customers describe the setup and on-going maintenance of their messaging infrastructure as “painful” and report that they spend at least 10 staff-hours per week on this chore.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Amazon MQ</strong></span><br /> Today we are launching <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/" title="">Amazon MQ</a> – a managed message broker service for <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/">Apache ActiveMQ</a> that lets you get started in minutes with just three clicks! As you may know, ActiveMQ is a popular open-source message broker that is fast &amp; feature-rich. It offers queues and topics, durable and non-durable subscriptions, push-based and poll-based messaging, and filtering.</p> 
<p>As a managed service, <span title="">Amazon MQ</span> takes care of the administration and maintenance of ActiveMQ. This includes responsibility for broker provisioning, patching, failure detection &amp; recovery for high availability, and message durability. With <span title="">Amazon MQ</span>, you get direct access to the ActiveMQ console and industry standard APIs and protocols for messaging, including JMS, NMS, AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, and WebSocket. This allows you to move from any message broker that uses these standards to <span title="">Amazon MQ</span>–along with the supported applications–without rewriting code.</p> 
<p>You can create a single-instance <span title="">Amazon MQ</span> broker for development and testing, or an active/standby pair that spans AZs, with quick, automatic failover. Either way, you get data replication across AZs and a pay-as-you-go model for the broker instance and message storage.</p> 
<p><span title="">Amazon MQ</span> is a full-fledged part of the AWS family, including the use of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/" title="">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> for authentication and authorization to use the service API. You can use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" title="">Amazon CloudWatch</a> metrics to keep a watchful eye metrics such as queue depth and initiate <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling" title="">Auto Scaling</a> of your consumer fleet as needed.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Launching an Amazon MQ Broker</strong></span><br /> To get started, I open up the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/home">Amazon MQ Console</a>, select the desired AWS Region, enter a name for my broker, and click on <strong>Next step</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/mq_con_4.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I choose the instance type, indicate that I want to create a standby , and click on <strong>Create broker</strong> (I can select a VPC and fine-tune other settings in the <strong>Advanced settings</strong> section):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/mq_create_2.png" /></p> 
<p>My broker will be created and ready to use in 5-10 minutes:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/mq_go_for_broker_2.png" /></p> 
<p>The URLs and endpoints that I use to access my broker are all available at a click:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/mq_my_broker_details_3.png" /></p> 
<p>I can access the ActiveMQ Web Console at the link provided:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/mq_mq_console_3.png" /></p> 
<p>The broker publishes instance, topic, and queue metrics to CloudWatch. Here are the instance metrics:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/mq_broker_metrics_1.png" /></p> 
<p>To learn more, read the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/welcome.html">Amazon MQ Developer Guide</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> <span title="">Amazon MQ</span> is available now and you can start using it today in the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span>, <span title="">US East (Ohio)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span>, <span title="">EU (Frankfurt)</span>, and <span title="">Asia Pacific (Sydney)</span> Regions.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" title="">AWS Free Tier</a> lets you use a single-AZ micro instance for up to 750 hours and to store up to 1 gigabyte each month, for one year. After that, billing is based on instance-hours and message storage, plus charges Internet data transfer if the broker is accessed from outside of AWS.</p>

<p>In this day and age, it is almost impossible to do without our mobile devices and the applications that help make our lives easier. As our dependency on our mobile phone grows, the mobile application market has exploded with millions of apps vying for our attention. For mobile developers, this means that we must ensure that we build applications that provide the quality, real-time experiences that app users desire.&nbsp; Therefore, it has become essential that mobile applications are developed to include features such as multi-user data synchronization, offline network support, and data discovery, just to name a few.&nbsp; According to several articles, I read recently about mobile development trends on publications like <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/latest-mobile-app-development-trends/">InfoQ</a>, <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/11-mobile-app-development-trends-to-stay-in-2017">DZone</a>, and the mobile development blog <a href="http://www.alleviatetech.com/blog/top-class-mobile-app-development-trends-will-rule-2018/">AlleviateTech</a>, one of the key elements in of delivering the aforementioned capabilities is with cloud-driven mobile applications.&nbsp; It seems that this is especially true, as it related to mobile data synchronization and data storage.</p> 
<p>That being the case, it is a perfect time for me to announce a new service for building innovative mobile applications that are driven by data-intensive services in the cloud; <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/"><strong>AWS AppSync</strong></a>. <strong>AWS AppSync</strong> is a fully managed serverless <a href="http://graphql.org/"><strong>GraphQL</strong></a> service for real-time data queries, synchronization, communications and offline programming features. For those not familiar, let me briefly share some information about the open <a href="http://facebook.github.io/graphql/">GraphQL specification</a>. GraphQL is a responsive data query language and server-side runtime for querying data sources that allow for real-time data retrieval and dynamic query execution. You can use GraphQL to build a responsive API for use in when building client applications. GraphQL works at the application layer and provides a type system for defining schemas. These schemas serve as specifications to define how operations should be performed on the data and how the data should be structured when retrieved. Additionally, GraphQL has a declarative coding model which is supported by many client libraries and frameworks including React, React Native, iOS, and Android.</p> 
<p>Now the power of the GraphQL open standard query language is being brought to you in a rich managed service with <strong>AWS AppSync.&nbsp; </strong>With <strong>AppSync </strong>developers can simplify the retrieval and manipulation of data across multiple data sources with ease, allowing them to quickly prototype, build and create robust, collaborative, multi-user applications. AppSync keeps data updated when devices are connected, but enables developers to build solutions that work offline by caching data locally and synchronizing local data when connections become available.</p> 
<p>Let’s discuss some key concepts of AWS AppSync and how the service works.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #3366ff"><strong>AppSync Concepts</strong></span></span></p> 
<li><strong>AWS AppSync Client</strong>: service client that defines operations, wraps authorization details of requests, and manage offline logic.</li> 
<li><strong>Data Source</strong>: the data storage system or a trigger housing data</li> 
<li><strong>Identity</strong>: a set of credentials with permissions and identification context provided with requests to GraphQL proxy</li> 
<li><strong>GraphQL Proxy</strong>: the GraphQL engine component for processing and mapping requests,&nbsp;handling conflict resolution, and managing Fine Grained Access Control</li> 
<li><strong>Operation:</strong> one of three GraphQL operations supported in AppSync 
<li>Query: a read-only fetch call to the data</li> 
<li>Mutation: a write of the data followed by a fetch,</li> 
<li>Subscription: long-lived connections that receive data in response to events.</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li><strong>Action</strong>: a notification to connected subscribers from a GraphQL subscription.</li> 
<li><strong>Resolver:</strong> function using request and response mapping templates that converts and executes payload against data source</li> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;text-decoration: underline">How It Works</span></strong></span></p> 
<p>A schema is created to define types and capabilities of the desired GraphQL API and tied to a <strong>Resolver</strong> function.&nbsp; The schema can be created to mirror existing data sources or AWS AppSync can create tables automatically based the schema definition. Developers can also use GraphQL features for data discovery without having knowledge of the backend data sources. After a schema definition is established, an <strong>AWS AppSync</strong> client can be configured with an operation request, like a Query operation. The client submits the operation request to <strong>GraphQL Proxy</strong> along with an identity context and credentials. The <strong>GraphQL Proxy</strong> passes this request to the <strong>Resolver</strong> which maps and executes the request payload against pre-configured AWS data services like an <strong>Amazon DynamoDB</strong> table, an <strong>AWS Lambda</strong> function, or a search capability using <strong>Amazon Elasticsearch</strong>. The <strong>Resolver</strong> executes calls to one or all of these services within a single network call minimizing CPU cycles and bandwidth needs and returns the response to the client. Additionally, the client application can change data requirements in code on demand and the <strong>AppSync GraphQL API</strong> will dynamically map requests for data accordingly, allowing prototyping and faster development.</p> 
<p>In order to take a quick peek at the service, I’ll go to the <strong>AWS AppSync</strong> console. I’ll click the <strong>Create API</strong> button to get started.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS AppSync-01-Console-3.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When the <strong>Create new API</strong> screen opens, I’ll give my new API a name, <strong>TarasTestApp</strong>, and since I am just exploring the new service I will select the <strong>Sample schema</strong> option.&nbsp; You may notice from the informational dialog box on the screen that in using the sample schema, AWS AppSync will automatically create the DynamoDB tables and the IAM roles for me.It will also deploy the <strong>TarasTestApp </strong>API on my behalf.&nbsp; After review of the sample schema provided by the console, I’ll click the <strong>Create button</strong> to create my test API.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS AppSync-02-CreateAPI.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS AppSync-03-SampleSchema.png" /></p> 
<p>After the <strong>TaraTestApp </strong>API has been created and the associated AWS resources provisioned on my behalf, I can make updates to the schema, data source, or connect my data source(s) to a resolver. I also can integrate my GraphQL API into an iOS, Android, Web, or React Native application by cloning the sample repo from GitHub and downloading the accompanying GraphQL schema.&nbsp; These application samples are great to help get you started and they are pre-configured to function in offline scenarios.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS AppSync-04-APIDetails.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS AppSync-05-AppDownload.png" /></p> 
<p>If I select the <strong>Schema</strong> menu option on the console, I can update and view the <strong>TarasTestApp</strong> GraphQL API schema.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS AppSync-06-SchemaDetails.png" /><br /> Additionally, if I select the Data Sources menu option in the console, I can see the existing data sources.&nbsp; Within this screen, I can update, delete, or add data sources if I so desire.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS AppSync-07-DataSource.png" /></p> 
<p>Next, I will select the <strong>Query</strong> menu option which takes me to the console tool for writing and testing queries. Since I chose the sample schema and the <strong>AWS AppSync</strong> service did most of the heavy lifting for me, I’ll try a query against my new GraphQL API.</p> 
<p>I’ll use a mutation to add data for the event type in my schema. Since this is a mutation and it first writes data and then does a read of the data, I want the query to return values for name and where.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS AppSync-08-Queries.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS AppSync-09-QueryExecution.png" /></p> 
<p>If I go to the DynamoDB table created for the event type in the schema, I will see that the values from my query have been successfully written into the table. Now that was a pretty simple task to write and retrieve data based on a GraphQL API schema from a data source, don’t you think.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/colmmacc">Colm MacC&aacute;rthaigh</a> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-privatelink-endpoints-kinesis-ec2-systems-manager-and-elb-apis-in-your-vpc/">told you about</a> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html#what-is-privatelink">AWS PrivateLink</a> and showed you how to use it to access AWS services such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/streams/" title="">Amazon Kinesis Streams</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/" title="">AWS Service Catalog</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/systems-manager/">EC2 Systems Manager</a>, the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">EC2 APIs</a>, and the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">ELB APIs</a> by way of VPC Endpoints. The endpoint (represented by one or more <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/elastic-network-adapter-high-performance-network-interface-for-amazon-ec2/">Elastic Network Interfaces</a> or ENIs) resides within your VPC and has IP addresses drawn from the VPC’s subnets, without the need for an Internet or NAT Gateway. This model is clear and easy to understand, not to mention secure and scalable!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Endpoints for Private Connectivity</strong></span><br /> Today we are building upon the initial launch and extending the PrivateLink model, allowing you to set up and use VPC Endpoints to access your own services and those made available by others. Even before we launched PrivateLink for AWS services, we had a lot of requests for this feature, so I expect it to be pretty popular. For example, one customer told us that they plan to create hundreds of VPCs, each hosting and providing a single microservice (read <a href="https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/microservices-on-aws.pdf">Microservices on AWS</a> to learn more).</p> 
<p>Companies can now create services and offer them for sale to other AWS customers, for access via a private connection. They create a service that accepts TCP traffic, host it behind a Network Load Balancer, and then make the service available, either directly or in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/" title="">AWS Marketplace</a>. They will be notified of new subscription requests and can choose to accept or reject each one. I expect that this feature will be used to create a strong, vibrant ecosystem of service providers in 2018.</p> 
<p>The service provider and the service consumer run in separate VPCs and AWS accounts and communicate solely through the endpoint, with all traffic flowing across Amazon’s private network. Service consumers don’t have to worry about overlapping IP addresses, arrange for VPC peering, or use a VPC Gateway. You can also use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/" title="">AWS Direct Connect</a> to connect your existing data center to one of your VPCs in order to allow your cloud-based applications to access services running on-premises, or vice versa.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Providing and Consuming Services</strong></span><br /> This new feature puts a lot of power at your fingertips. You can set it all up using the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">VPC APIs</a>, the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/index.html#cli-aws-ec2">VPC CLI</a>, or the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>. I’ll use the console, and will show you how to provide and then consume a service. I am going to do both within a single AWS account, but that’s just for demo purposes.</p> 
<p>Let’s talk about providing a service. It must run behind a Network Load Balancer and must be accessible over TCP. It can be hosted on EC2 instances, ECS containers, or on-premises (configured as an IP target), and should be able to scale in order to meet the expected level of demand. For low latency and fault tolerance, we recommend using an NLB with targets in every AZ of its region. Here’s mine:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_lb_targets_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I open up the VPC Console and navigate to <strong>Endpoint Services</strong>, then click on <strong>Create Endpoint Service</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_dash_create_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I choose my NLB (just one in this case, but I can choose two or more and they will be mapped to consumers on a round-robin basis). By clicking on <strong>Acceptance required</strong>, I get to control access to my endpoint on a request-by-request basis:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_create_ep_svc_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I click on <strong>Create service</strong> and my service is ready immediately:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_my_eps_1.png" /></p> 
<p>If I was going to make this service available in <span title="">AWS Marketplace</span>, I would go ahead and create a listing now. Since I am going to be the producer and the consumer in this blog post, I’ll skip that step. I will, however, copy the <strong>Service name</strong> for use in the next step.</p> 
<p>I return to the VPC Dashboard and navigate to Endpoints, then click on <strong>Create endpoint</strong>. Then I select <strong>Find service by name</strong>, paste the service name, and click on <strong>Verify </strong>to move ahead. Then I select the desired AZs, and a subnet in each one, pick my security groups, and click on <strong>Create endpoint</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_create_my_ep_client_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Because I checked Acceptance required when I created the endpoint service, the connection is pending acceptance:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_con_pending_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Back on the endpoint service side (typically in a separate AWS account), I can see and accept the pending request:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_accept_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The endpoint becomes available and ready to use within a minute or so. If I was creating a service and selling access on a paid basis, I would accept the request as part of a larger, and perhaps automated, onboarding workflow for a new customer.</p> 
<p>On the consumer side, my new endpoint is accessible via DNS name:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_dns_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Services provided by AWS and services in <span title="">AWS Marketplace</span> are accessible through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-horizon_DNS">split-horizon</a> DNS. Accessing the service through this name will resolve to the “best” endpoint, taking Region and Availability Zone into consideration.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>In the Marketplace</strong></span><br /> As I noted earlier, this new PrivateLink feature creates an opportunity for new and existing sellers in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/" title="">AWS Marketplace</a>. The following SaaS offerings are already available as endpoints and I expect many more to follow (read <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/tour/?ref=mkt_ste_catgtm_saashome&amp;refid=_TWITTER">Sell on AWS Marketplace</a> to get started):</p>
