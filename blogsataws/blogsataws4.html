<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/">EC2 Spot Instances</a> give you access to spare compute capacity in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" title="">AWS Cloud</a>. Our customers use fleets of Spot Instances to power their <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/scaling-up-tenfold-with-amazon-ec2-spot-instances-may-2017-aws-online-tech-talks">CI/CD environments</a> &amp; traffic generators, host <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/an-ec2-spot-architecture-for-web-applications/">web servers &amp; microservices</a>, <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/cost-effective-rendering-in-the-cloud-with-spot-instances">render movies</a>, and to run many types of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/cost-effective-batch-processing-with-amazon-ec2-spot/">analytics jobs</a>, all at prices that offer significant savings in comparison to On-Demand Instances.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Streamlined Access</strong></span><br /> Today we are introducing a new, streamlined access model for Spot Instances. You simply indicate your desire to use Spot capacity when you launch an instance via the <code><a title="undefined" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html" target="null">RunInstances</a></code> function, the <code><a title="undefined" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html" target="null">run-instances</a></code> command, or the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a> to submit a request that will be fulfilled as long as the capacity is available. With no extra effort on your part you’ll save up to 90% off of the On-Demand price for the instance type, allowing you to boost your overall application throughput by up to 10x for the same budget. The instances that you launch in this way will continue to run until you terminate them or if EC2 needs to reclaim them for On-Demand usage. At that point the instance will be given the usual 2-minute warning and then reclaimed, making this a great fit for applications that are fault-tolerant.</p> 
<p>Unlike the old model which required an understanding of Spot markets, bidding, and calls to a standalone asynchronous API, the new model is synchronous and as easy to use as On-Demand. Your code or your script receives an Instance ID immediately and need not check back to see if the request has been processed and accepted.</p> 
<p>We’ve made this as clean and as simple as possible, with the expectation that it will be easy to modify many current scripts and applications to request and make use of Spot capacity. If you want to exercise additional control over your Spot instance budget, you have the option to specify a maximum price when you make a request for capacity. If you use Spot capacity to power your <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/" title="">Amazon EMR</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" title="">Amazon ECS</a>, or <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/batch" title="">AWS Batch</a> clusters, or if you launch Spot instances by way of a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" title="">AWS CloudFormation</a> template or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling" title="">Auto Scaling</a> Group, you will benefit from this new model without having to make any changes.</p> 
<p>Applications that are built around <code><a title="undefined" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotInstances.html" target="null">RequestSpotInstances</a></code> or <code><a title="undefined" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotFleet.html" target="null">RequestSpotFleet</a></code> will continue to work just fine with no changes. However, you now have the option to make requests that do not include the <code>SpotPrice</code> parameter.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Smooth Price Changes</strong></span><br /> As part of today’s launch we are also changing the way that Spot prices change, moving to a model where prices adjust more gradually, based on longer-term trends in supply and demand. As I mentioned earlier, you will continue to save an average of 70-90% off the On-Demand price, and you will continue to pay the Spot price that’s in effect for the time period your instances are running. Applications built around our Spot Fleet feature will continue to automatically diversify placement of their Spot Instances across the most cost-effective pools based on the configuration you specified when you created the fleet.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Spot in Action</strong></span><br /> To launch a Spot Instance from the command line; simply specify the <strong>Spot</strong> market:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">$ aws ec2 run-instances --instance-market-options '{&quot;MarketType&quot;:&quot;Spot&quot;}' \
--image-id ami-1a2b3c4d --count 1 --instance-type c3.large</code> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Instance Hibernation</strong></span><br /> If you run workloads that keep a lot of state in memory, you will love this new feature!</p> 
<p>You can arrange for instances to save their in-memory state when they are reclaimed, allowing the instances and the applications on them to pick up where they left off when capacity is once again available, just like closing and then opening your laptop. This feature works on C3, C4, and certain sizes of R3, R4, and M4 instances running Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, or Windows Server, and is supported by the EC2 Hibernation Agent.</p> 
<p>The in-memory state is written to the root EBS volume of the instance using space that is set-aside when the instance launches. The private IP address and any Elastic IP Addresses are also preserved across a stop/start cycle.</p>

<p>Threats to your IT infrastructure (AWS accounts &amp; credentials, AWS resources, guest operating systems, and applications) come in all shapes and sizes! The online world can be a treacherous place and we want to make sure that you have the tools, knowledge, and perspective to keep your IT infrastructure safe &amp; sound.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/"></a><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/" title="">Amazon GuardDuty</a> is designed to give you just that. Informed by a multitude of public and AWS-generated data feeds and powered by machine learning, <span title="">GuardDuty</span> analyzes billions of events in pursuit of trends, patterns, and anomalies that are recognizable signs that something is amiss. You can enable it with a click and see the first findings within minutes.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>How it Works</strong></span><br /> <span title="">GuardDuty</span> voraciously consumes multiple data streams, including several threat intelligence feeds, staying aware of malicious IP addresses, devious domains, and more importantly, learning to accurately identify malicious or unauthorized behavior in your AWS accounts. In combination with information gleaned from your VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail Event Logs, and DNS logs, this allows <span title="">GuardDuty</span> to detect many different types of dangerous and mischievous behavior including probes for known vulnerabilities, port scans and probes, and access from unusual locations. On the AWS side, it looks for suspicious AWS account activity such as unauthorized deployments, unusual CloudTrail activity, patterns of access to AWS API functions, and attempts to exceed multiple service limits. <span title="">GuardDuty</span> will also look for compromised EC2 instances talking to malicious entities or services, data exfiltration attempts, and instances that are mining cryptocurrency.</p> 
<p><span title="">GuardDuty</span> operates completely on AWS infrastructure and does not affect the performance or reliability of your workloads. You do not need to install or manage any agents, sensors, or network appliances. This clean, zero-footprint model should appeal to your security team and allow them to green-light the use of <span title="">GuardDuty</span> across all of your AWS accounts.</p> 
<p>Findings are presented to you at one of three levels (low, medium, or high), accompanied by detailed evidence and recommendations for remediation. The findings are also available as Amazon CloudWatch Events; this allows you to use your own <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> functions to automatically remediate specific types of issues. This mechanism also allows you to easily push <span title="">GuardDuty</span> findings into event management systems such as <a href="https://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>, <a href="https://www.sumologic.com/">Sumo Logic</a>, and <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a> and to workflow systems like <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a>, <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/">ServiceNow</a>, and <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>A Quick Tour</strong></span><br /> Let’s take a quick tour. I open up the <span title="">GuardDuty</span> Console and click on <strong>Get started</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/gd_con_splash_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I confirm that I want to enable <span title="">GuardDuty</span>. This gives it permission to set up the appropriate <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html">service-linked roles</a> and to analyze my logs by clicking on Enable GuardDuty:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/gd_ready_enable_1.png" /></p> 
<p>My own AWS environment isn’t all that exciting, so I visit the <strong>General Settings</strong> and click on <strong>Generate sample findings</strong> to move ahead. Now I’ve got some intriguing findings:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/gd_sample_findings_2.png" /></p> 
<p>I can click on a finding to learn more:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/gd_sample_ec2_5.png" /></p> 
<p>The magnifying glass icons allow me to create inclusion or exclusion filters for the associated resource, action, or other value. I can filter for all of the findings related to this instance:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/gd_ec2_filter_2.png" /></p> 
<p>I can customize <span title="">GuardDuty</span> by adding lists of trusted IP addresses and lists of malicious IP addresses that are peculiar to my environment:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/gd_add_lists_1.png" /></p> 
<p>After I enable <span title="">GuardDuty</span> in my administrator account, I can invite my other accounts to participate:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/gd_add_acft_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Once the accounts decide to participate, <span title="">GuardDuty</span> will arrange for their findings to be shared with the administrator account.</p> 
<p>I’ve barely scratched the surface of <span title="">GuardDuty</span> in the limited space and time that I have. You can try it out at no charge for 30 days; after that you pay based on the number of entries it processes from your VPC Flow, CloudTrail, and DNS logs.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/" title="">Amazon GuardDuty</a> is available in production form in the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span>, <span title="">US East (Ohio)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, <span title="">US West (Northern California)</span>, <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span>, <span title="">EU (Frankfurt)</span>, <span title="">EU (London)</span>, <span title="">South America (S&atilde;o Paulo)</span>, <span title="">Canada (Central)</span>, <span title="">Asia Pacific (Tokyo)</span>, <span title="">Asia Pacific (Seoul)</span>, <span title="">Asia Pacific (Singapore)</span>, <span title="">Asia Pacific (Sydney)</span>, and <span title="">Asia Pacific (Mumbai)</span> Regions and you can start using it today!</p>

<p>When customers come to us with new and unique requirements for AWS, we listen closely, ask lots of questions, and do our best to understand and address their needs. When we do this, we make the resulting service or feature generally available; we do not build one-offs or “snowflakes” for individual customers. That model is messy and hard to scale and is not the way we work.</p> 
<p>Instead, every AWS customer has access to whatever it is that we build, and everyone benefits. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/vmware-cloud-on-aws-now-available/">VMware Cloud on AWS</a> is a good example of this strategy in action. They told us that they wanted to run their virtualization stack directly on the hardware, within the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" title="">AWS Cloud</a>, giving their customers access to the elasticity, security, and reliability (not to mention the broad array of services) that AWS offers.</p> 
<p>We knew that other customers also had interesting use cases for bare metal hardware and didn’t want to take the performance hit of nested virtualization. They wanted access to the physical resources for applications that take advantage of low-level hardware features such as <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/resource-director-technology.html">performance counters</a> and <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/virtualization/virtualization-technology/intel-virtualization-technology.html">Intel<sup>&reg;</sup> VT</a> that are not always available or fully supported in virtualized environments, and also for applications intended to run directly on the hardware or licensed and supported for use in non-virtualized environments.</p> 
<p>Our multi-year effort to move networking, storage, and other EC2 features out of our virtualization platform and into dedicated hardware was already well underway and provided the perfect foundation for a possible solution. This work, as I described in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-compute-intensive-c5-instances-for-amazon-ec2/">Now Available – Compute-Intensive C5 Instances for Amazon EC2</a>, includes a set of dedicated hardware accelerators.</p> 
<p>Now that we have provided VMware with the bare metal access that they requested, we are doing the same for all AWS customers. I’m really looking forward to seeing what you can do with them!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Bare Metal Instances</strong></span><br /> Today we are launching a public preview the <strong>i3.metal</strong> instance, the first in a series of EC2 instances that offer the best of both worlds, allowing the operating system to run directly on the underlying hardware while still providing access to all of the benefits of the cloud. The instance gives you direct access to the processor and other hardware, and has the following specifications:</p> 
<li><strong>Processing</strong> – Two Intel Xeon E5-2686 v4 processors running at 2.3 GHz, with a total of 36 hyperthreaded cores (72 logical processors).</li> 
<li><strong>Memory</strong> – 512 GiB.</li> 
<li><strong>Storage</strong> – 15.2 terabytes of local, SSD-based NVMe storage.</li> 
<li><strong>Network</strong> – 25 Gbps of ENA-based enhanced networking.</li> 
<p>Bare Metal instances are full-fledged members of the EC2 family and can take advantage of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing" title="">Elastic Load Balancing</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling" title="">Auto Scaling</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" title="">Amazon CloudWatch</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-auto-recovery-for-amazon-ec2/">Auto Recovery</a>, and so forth. They can also access the full suite of AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/">database</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot/">IoT</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mobile/">mobile</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/products/analytics/">analytics</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/">artificial intelligence</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/">security</a> services.</p> 
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Previewing Now</span></strong><br /> We are launching a public preview of the Bare Metal instances today; please <a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/amazon-ec2-bare-metal-instances-preview.html">sign up now</a> if you want to try them out.</p> 
<p>You can now bring your specialized applications or your own stack of virtualized components to AWS and run them on Bare Metal instances. If you are using or thinking about using containers, these instances make a great host for <a href="https://coreos.com/">CoreOS</a>.</p> 
<p>An AMI that works on one of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-compute-intensive-c5-instances-for-amazon-ec2/">new C5 instances</a> should also work on an I3 Bare Metal Instance. It must have the ENA and NVMe drivers, and must be tagged for ENA.</p>

<p>Messaging holds the parts of a distributed application together, while also adding resiliency and enabling the implementation of highly scalable architectures. For example, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/prime-day-2017-powered-by-aws/">earlier this year</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" title="">Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns/" title="">Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)</a> supported the processing of customer orders on Prime Day, collectively processing 40 billion messages at a rate of 10 million per second, with no customer-visible issues.</p> 
<p>SQS and SNS have been used extensively for applications that were born in the cloud. However, many of our larger customers are already making use of open-sourced or commercially-licensed message brokers. Their applications are mission-critical, and so is the messaging that powers them. Our customers describe the setup and on-going maintenance of their messaging infrastructure as “painful” and report that they spend at least 10 staff-hours per week on this chore.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Amazon MQ</strong></span><br /> Today we are launching <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/" title="">Amazon MQ</a> – a managed message broker service for <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/">Apache ActiveMQ</a> that lets you get started in minutes with just three clicks! As you may know, ActiveMQ is a popular open-source message broker that is fast &amp; feature-rich. It offers queues and topics, durable and non-durable subscriptions, push-based and poll-based messaging, and filtering.</p> 
<p>As a managed service, <span title="">Amazon MQ</span> takes care of the administration and maintenance of ActiveMQ. This includes responsibility for broker provisioning, patching, failure detection &amp; recovery for high availability, and message durability. With <span title="">Amazon MQ</span>, you get direct access to the ActiveMQ console and industry standard APIs and protocols for messaging, including JMS, NMS, AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, and WebSocket. This allows you to move from any message broker that uses these standards to <span title="">Amazon MQ</span>–along with the supported applications–without rewriting code.</p> 
<p>You can create a single-instance <span title="">Amazon MQ</span> broker for development and testing, or an active/standby pair that spans AZs, with quick, automatic failover. Either way, you get data replication across AZs and a pay-as-you-go model for the broker instance and message storage.</p> 
<p><span title="">Amazon MQ</span> is a full-fledged part of the AWS family, including the use of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/" title="">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> for authentication and authorization to use the service API. You can use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" title="">Amazon CloudWatch</a> metrics to keep a watchful eye metrics such as queue depth and initiate <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling" title="">Auto Scaling</a> of your consumer fleet as needed.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Launching an Amazon MQ Broker</strong></span><br /> To get started, I open up the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/home">Amazon MQ Console</a>, select the desired AWS Region, enter a name for my broker, and click on <strong>Next step</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/mq_con_4.png" /></p> 
<p>Then I choose the instance type, indicate that I want to create a standby , and click on <strong>Create broker</strong> (I can select a VPC and fine-tune other settings in the <strong>Advanced settings</strong> section):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/mq_create_2.png" /></p> 
<p>My broker will be created and ready to use in 5-10 minutes:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/mq_go_for_broker_2.png" /></p> 
<p>The URLs and endpoints that I use to access my broker are all available at a click:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/mq_my_broker_details_3.png" /></p> 
<p>I can access the ActiveMQ Web Console at the link provided:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/mq_mq_console_3.png" /></p> 
<p>The broker publishes instance, topic, and queue metrics to CloudWatch. Here are the instance metrics:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/mq_broker_metrics_1.png" /></p> 
<p>To learn more, read the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/latest/developer-guide/welcome.html">Amazon MQ Developer Guide</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> <span title="">Amazon MQ</span> is available now and you can start using it today in the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span>, <span title="">US East (Ohio)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span>, <span title="">EU (Frankfurt)</span>, and <span title="">Asia Pacific (Sydney)</span> Regions.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" title="">AWS Free Tier</a> lets you use a single-AZ micro instance for up to 750 hours and to store up to 1 gigabyte each month, for one year. After that, billing is based on instance-hours and message storage, plus charges Internet data transfer if the broker is accessed from outside of AWS.</p>

<p>In this day and age, it is almost impossible to do without our mobile devices and the applications that help make our lives easier. As our dependency on our mobile phone grows, the mobile application market has exploded with millions of apps vying for our attention. For mobile developers, this means that we must ensure that we build applications that provide the quality, real-time experiences that app users desire.&nbsp; Therefore, it has become essential that mobile applications are developed to include features such as multi-user data synchronization, offline network support, and data discovery, just to name a few.&nbsp; According to several articles, I read recently about mobile development trends on publications like <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/latest-mobile-app-development-trends/">InfoQ</a>, <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/11-mobile-app-development-trends-to-stay-in-2017">DZone</a>, and the mobile development blog <a href="http://www.alleviatetech.com/blog/top-class-mobile-app-development-trends-will-rule-2018/">AlleviateTech</a>, one of the key elements in of delivering the aforementioned capabilities is with cloud-driven mobile applications.&nbsp; It seems that this is especially true, as it related to mobile data synchronization and data storage.</p> 
<p>That being the case, it is a perfect time for me to announce a new service for building innovative mobile applications that are driven by data-intensive services in the cloud; <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/"><strong>AWS AppSync</strong></a>. <strong>AWS AppSync</strong> is a fully managed serverless <a href="http://graphql.org/"><strong>GraphQL</strong></a> service for real-time data queries, synchronization, communications and offline programming features. For those not familiar, let me briefly share some information about the open <a href="http://facebook.github.io/graphql/">GraphQL specification</a>. GraphQL is a responsive data query language and server-side runtime for querying data sources that allow for real-time data retrieval and dynamic query execution. You can use GraphQL to build a responsive API for use in when building client applications. GraphQL works at the application layer and provides a type system for defining schemas. These schemas serve as specifications to define how operations should be performed on the data and how the data should be structured when retrieved. Additionally, GraphQL has a declarative coding model which is supported by many client libraries and frameworks including React, React Native, iOS, and Android.</p> 
<p>Now the power of the GraphQL open standard query language is being brought to you in a rich managed service with <strong>AWS AppSync.&nbsp; </strong>With <strong>AppSync </strong>developers can simplify the retrieval and manipulation of data across multiple data sources with ease, allowing them to quickly prototype, build and create robust, collaborative, multi-user applications. AppSync keeps data updated when devices are connected, but enables developers to build solutions that work offline by caching data locally and synchronizing local data when connections become available.</p> 
<p>Let’s discuss some key concepts of AWS AppSync and how the service works.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #3366ff"><strong>AppSync Concepts</strong></span></span></p> 
<li><strong>AWS AppSync Client</strong>: service client that defines operations, wraps authorization details of requests, and manage offline logic.</li> 
<li><strong>Data Source</strong>: the data storage system or a trigger housing data</li> 
<li><strong>Identity</strong>: a set of credentials with permissions and identification context provided with requests to GraphQL proxy</li> 
<li><strong>GraphQL Proxy</strong>: the GraphQL engine component for processing and mapping requests,&nbsp;handling conflict resolution, and managing Fine Grained Access Control</li> 
<li><strong>Operation:</strong> one of three GraphQL operations supported in AppSync 
<li>Query: a read-only fetch call to the data</li> 
<li>Mutation: a write of the data followed by a fetch,</li> 
<li>Subscription: long-lived connections that receive data in response to events.</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li><strong>Action</strong>: a notification to connected subscribers from a GraphQL subscription.</li> 
<li><strong>Resolver:</strong> function using request and response mapping templates that converts and executes payload against data source</li> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;text-decoration: underline">How It Works</span></strong></span></p> 
<p>A schema is created to define types and capabilities of the desired GraphQL API and tied to a <strong>Resolver</strong> function.&nbsp; The schema can be created to mirror existing data sources or AWS AppSync can create tables automatically based the schema definition. Developers can also use GraphQL features for data discovery without having knowledge of the backend data sources. After a schema definition is established, an <strong>AWS AppSync</strong> client can be configured with an operation request, like a Query operation. The client submits the operation request to <strong>GraphQL Proxy</strong> along with an identity context and credentials. The <strong>GraphQL Proxy</strong> passes this request to the <strong>Resolver</strong> which maps and executes the request payload against pre-configured AWS data services like an <strong>Amazon DynamoDB</strong> table, an <strong>AWS Lambda</strong> function, or a search capability using <strong>Amazon Elasticsearch</strong>. The <strong>Resolver</strong> executes calls to one or all of these services within a single network call minimizing CPU cycles and bandwidth needs and returns the response to the client. Additionally, the client application can change data requirements in code on demand and the <strong>AppSync GraphQL API</strong> will dynamically map requests for data accordingly, allowing prototyping and faster development.</p> 
<p>In order to take a quick peek at the service, I’ll go to the <strong>AWS AppSync</strong> console. I’ll click the <strong>Create API</strong> button to get started.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS AppSync-01-Console-3.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When the <strong>Create new API</strong> screen opens, I’ll give my new API a name, <strong>TarasTestApp</strong>, and since I am just exploring the new service I will select the <strong>Sample schema</strong> option.&nbsp; You may notice from the informational dialog box on the screen that in using the sample schema, AWS AppSync will automatically create the DynamoDB tables and the IAM roles for me.It will also deploy the <strong>TarasTestApp </strong>API on my behalf.&nbsp; After review of the sample schema provided by the console, I’ll click the <strong>Create button</strong> to create my test API.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS AppSync-02-CreateAPI.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS AppSync-03-SampleSchema.png" /></p> 
<p>After the <strong>TaraTestApp </strong>API has been created and the associated AWS resources provisioned on my behalf, I can make updates to the schema, data source, or connect my data source(s) to a resolver. I also can integrate my GraphQL API into an iOS, Android, Web, or React Native application by cloning the sample repo from GitHub and downloading the accompanying GraphQL schema.&nbsp; These application samples are great to help get you started and they are pre-configured to function in offline scenarios.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS AppSync-04-APIDetails.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS AppSync-05-AppDownload.png" /></p> 
<p>If I select the <strong>Schema</strong> menu option on the console, I can update and view the <strong>TarasTestApp</strong> GraphQL API schema.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS AppSync-06-SchemaDetails.png" /><br /> Additionally, if I select the Data Sources menu option in the console, I can see the existing data sources.&nbsp; Within this screen, I can update, delete, or add data sources if I so desire.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS AppSync-07-DataSource.png" /></p> 
<p>Next, I will select the <strong>Query</strong> menu option which takes me to the console tool for writing and testing queries. Since I chose the sample schema and the <strong>AWS AppSync</strong> service did most of the heavy lifting for me, I’ll try a query against my new GraphQL API.</p> 
<p>I’ll use a mutation to add data for the event type in my schema. Since this is a mutation and it first writes data and then does a read of the data, I want the query to return values for name and where.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS AppSync-08-Queries.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS AppSync-09-QueryExecution.png" /></p> 
<p>If I go to the DynamoDB table created for the event type in the schema, I will see that the values from my query have been successfully written into the table. Now that was a pretty simple task to write and retrieve data based on a GraphQL API schema from a data source, don’t you think.</p> 
<p><strong><u><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AWS AppSync-10-DynamoDBData.png" /><br /> </u></strong></p> 
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong><strong><u>Summary</u></strong></p>

<p>Earlier this month, my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/colmmacc">Colm MacC&aacute;rthaigh</a> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-privatelink-endpoints-kinesis-ec2-systems-manager-and-elb-apis-in-your-vpc/">told you about</a> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html#what-is-privatelink">AWS PrivateLink</a> and showed you how to use it to access AWS services such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/streams/" title="">Amazon Kinesis Streams</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/" title="">AWS Service Catalog</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/systems-manager/">EC2 Systems Manager</a>, the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">EC2 APIs</a>, and the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">ELB APIs</a> by way of VPC Endpoints. The endpoint (represented by one or more <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/elastic-network-adapter-high-performance-network-interface-for-amazon-ec2/">Elastic Network Interfaces</a> or ENIs) resides within your VPC and has IP addresses drawn from the VPC’s subnets, without the need for an Internet or NAT Gateway. This model is clear and easy to understand, not to mention secure and scalable!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Endpoints for Private Connectivity</strong></span><br /> Today we are building upon the initial launch and extending the PrivateLink model, allowing you to set up and use VPC Endpoints to access your own services and those made available by others. Even before we launched PrivateLink for AWS services, we had a lot of requests for this feature, so I expect it to be pretty popular. For example, one customer told us that they plan to create hundreds of VPCs, each hosting and providing a single microservice (read <a href="https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/microservices-on-aws.pdf">Microservices on AWS</a> to learn more).</p> 
<p>Companies can now create services and offer them for sale to other AWS customers, for access via a private connection. They create a service that accepts TCP traffic, host it behind a Network Load Balancer, and then make the service available, either directly or in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/" title="">AWS Marketplace</a>. They will be notified of new subscription requests and can choose to accept or reject each one. I expect that this feature will be used to create a strong, vibrant ecosystem of service providers in 2018.</p> 
<p>The service provider and the service consumer run in separate VPCs and AWS accounts and communicate solely through the endpoint, with all traffic flowing across Amazon’s private network. Service consumers don’t have to worry about overlapping IP addresses, arrange for VPC peering, or use a VPC Gateway. You can also use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/" title="">AWS Direct Connect</a> to connect your existing data center to one of your VPCs in order to allow your cloud-based applications to access services running on-premises, or vice versa.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Providing and Consuming Services</strong></span><br /> This new feature puts a lot of power at your fingertips. You can set it all up using the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">VPC APIs</a>, the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/index.html#cli-aws-ec2">VPC CLI</a>, or the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>. I’ll use the console, and will show you how to provide and then consume a service. I am going to do both within a single AWS account, but that’s just for demo purposes.</p> 
<p>Let’s talk about providing a service. It must run behind a Network Load Balancer and must be accessible over TCP. It can be hosted on EC2 instances, ECS containers, or on-premises (configured as an IP target), and should be able to scale in order to meet the expected level of demand. For low latency and fault tolerance, we recommend using an NLB with targets in every AZ of its region. Here’s mine:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_lb_targets_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I open up the VPC Console and navigate to <strong>Endpoint Services</strong>, then click on <strong>Create Endpoint Service</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_dash_create_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I choose my NLB (just one in this case, but I can choose two or more and they will be mapped to consumers on a round-robin basis). By clicking on <strong>Acceptance required</strong>, I get to control access to my endpoint on a request-by-request basis:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_create_ep_svc_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I click on <strong>Create service</strong> and my service is ready immediately:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_my_eps_1.png" /></p> 
<p>If I was going to make this service available in <span title="">AWS Marketplace</span>, I would go ahead and create a listing now. Since I am going to be the producer and the consumer in this blog post, I’ll skip that step. I will, however, copy the <strong>Service name</strong> for use in the next step.</p> 
<p>I return to the VPC Dashboard and navigate to Endpoints, then click on <strong>Create endpoint</strong>. Then I select <strong>Find service by name</strong>, paste the service name, and click on <strong>Verify </strong>to move ahead. Then I select the desired AZs, and a subnet in each one, pick my security groups, and click on <strong>Create endpoint</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_create_my_ep_client_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Because I checked Acceptance required when I created the endpoint service, the connection is pending acceptance:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_con_pending_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Back on the endpoint service side (typically in a separate AWS account), I can see and accept the pending request:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_accept_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The endpoint becomes available and ready to use within a minute or so. If I was creating a service and selling access on a paid basis, I would accept the request as part of a larger, and perhaps automated, onboarding workflow for a new customer.</p> 
<p>On the consumer side, my new endpoint is accessible via DNS name:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_dns_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Services provided by AWS and services in <span title="">AWS Marketplace</span> are accessible through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-horizon_DNS">split-horizon</a> DNS. Accessing the service through this name will resolve to the “best” endpoint, taking Region and Availability Zone into consideration.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>In the Marketplace</strong></span><br /> As I noted earlier, this new PrivateLink feature creates an opportunity for new and existing sellers in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/" title="">AWS Marketplace</a>. The following SaaS offerings are already available as endpoints and I expect many more to follow (read <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/tour/?ref=mkt_ste_catgtm_saashome&amp;refid=_TWITTER">Sell on AWS Marketplace</a> to get started):</p>

<p>Do you remember what web video was like in the early days? Standalone players, video no larger than a postage stamp, slow &amp; cantankerous connections, overloaded servers, and the ever-present <strong>buffering</strong> messages were the norm less than two decades ago.</p> 
<p>Today, thanks to technological progress and a broad array of standards, things are a lot better. Video consumers are now in control. They use devices of all shapes, sizes, and vintages to enjoy live and recorded content that is broadcast, streamed, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-top_media_services">sent over-the-top</a> (OTT, as they say), and expect immediate access to content that captures and then holds their attention. Meeting these expectations presents a challenge for content creators and distributors. Instead of generating video in a one-size-fits-all format, they (or their media servers) must be prepared to produce video that spans a broad range of sizes, formats, and bit rates, taking care to be ready to deal with planned or unplanned surges in demand. In the face of all of this complexity, they must backstop their content with a monetization model that supports the content and the infrastructure to deliver it.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New AWS Media Services</strong></span><br /> Today we are launching an array of broadcast-quality media services, each designed to address one or more aspects of the challenge that I outlined above. You can use them together to build a complete end-to-end video solution or you can use one or more in building-block style. In true AWS fashion, you can spend more time innovating and less time setting up and running infrastructure, leaving you ready to focus on creating, delivering, and monetizing your content. The services are all elastic, allowing you to ramp up processing power, connections, and storage and giving you the ability to handle million-user (and beyond) spikes with ease.</p> 
<p>Here are the services (all accessible from a set of interactive consoles as well as through a comprehensive set of APIs):</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaConvert</strong></a> – File-based transcoding for OTT, broadcast, or archiving, with support for a long list of formats and codecs. Features include multi-channel audio, graphic overlays, closed captioning, and several DRM options.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/medialive/"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaLive</strong></a> – Live encoding to deliver video streams in real time to both televisions and multiscreen devices. Allows you to deploy highly reliable live channels in minutes, with full control over encoding parameters. It supports ad insertion, multi-channel audio, graphic overlays, and closed captioning.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mediapackage/"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaPackage</strong></a> – Video origination and just-in-time packaging. Starting from a single input, produces output for multiple devices representing a long list of current and legacy formats. Supports multiple monetization models, time-shifted live streaming, ad insertion, DRM, and blackout management.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mediastore/"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaStore</strong></a> – Media-optimized storage that enables high performance and low latency applications such as live streaming, while taking advantage of the scale and durability of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a>.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaTailor</strong></a> – Monetization service that supports ad serving and server-side ad insertion, a broad range of devices, transcoding, and accurate reporting of server-side and client-side ad insertion.</p> 
<p>Instead of listing out all of the features in the sections below, I’ve simply included as many screen shots as possible with the expectation that this will give you a better sense of the rich set of features, parameters, and settings that you get with this set of services.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaConvert</strong></span><br /> MediaConvert allows you to transcode content that is stored in files. You can process individual files or entire media libraries, or anything in-between. You simply create a conversion job that specifies the content and the desired outputs, and submit it to MediaConvert. There’s no software to install or patch and the service scales to meet your needs without affecting turnaround time or performance.</p> 
<p>The MediaConvert Console lets you manage Output presets, Job templates, Queues, and Jobs:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_parts_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You can use a built-in system preset or you can make one of your own. You have full control over the settings when you make your own:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_preset_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Jobs templates are named, and produce one or more output groups. You can add a new group to a template with a click:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emcs_add_job_output_group_1.png" /></p> 
<p>When everything is ready to go, you create a job and make some final selections, then click on <strong>Create</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_create_job_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Each account starts with a default queue for jobs, where incoming work is processed in parallel using all processing resources available to the account. Adding queues does not add processing resources, but does cause them to be apportioned across queues. You can temporarily pause one queue in order to devote more resources to the others. You can submit jobs to paused queues and you can also cancel any that have yet to start.</p> 
<p>Pricing for this service is based on the amount of video that you process and the features that you use.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaLive</strong></span><br /> This service is for live encoding, and can be run 24&times;7. MediaLive channels are deployed on redundant resources distributed in two physically separated Availability Zones in order to provide the reliability expected by our customers in the broadcast industry. You can specify your inputs and define your channels in the MediaLive Console:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_create_ml_input_1.png" /></p> 
<p>After you create an Input, you create a Channel and attach it to the Input:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_create_live_channel_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You have full control over the settings for each channel:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_live_channel_settings_1.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaPackage</strong></span><br /> This service lets you deliver video to many devices from a single source. It focuses on protection and just-in-time packaging, giving you the ability to provide your users with the desired content on the device of their choice. You simply create a channel to get started:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_pack_make_channel_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Then you add one or more endpoints. Once again, plenty of options and full control, including a startover window and a time delay:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_pack_endpoints_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You find the input URL, user name, and password for your channel and route your live video stream to it for packaging:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_pack_channel_info_1.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaStore</strong></span><br /> MediaStore offers the performance, consistency, and latency required for live and on-demand media delivery. Objects are written and read into a new “temporal” tier of object storage for a limited amount of time, then move silently into <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">S3</a> for long-lived durability. You simply create a storage container to group your media content:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_store_create_container_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The container is available within a minute or so:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_store_containers_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Like S3 buckets, MediaStore containers have access policies and no limits on the number of objects or storage capacity.</p> 
<p>MediaStore helps you to take full advantage of S3 by managing the object key names so as to maximize storage and retrieval throughput, in accord with the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/request-rate-perf-considerations.html">Request Rate and Performance Considerations</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaTailor</strong></span><br /> This service takes care of server-side ad insertion while providing a broadcast-quality viewer experience by transcoding ad assets on the fly. Your customer’s video player asks MediaTailor for a playlist. MediaTailor, in turn, calls your Ad Decision Server and returns a playlist that references the origin server for your original video and the ads recommended by the Ad Decision Server. The video player makes all of its requests to a single endpoint in order to ensure that client-side ad-blocking is ineffective. You simply create a MediaTailor Configuration:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_tailor_config_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Context information is passed to the Ad Decision Server in the URL:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/wmc_ads_params_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Despite the length of this post I have barely scratched the surface of the AWS Media Services. Once <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a> is in the rear view mirror I hope to do a deep dive and show you how to use each of these services.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> The entire set of AWS Media Services is available now and you can start using them today! Pricing varies by service, but is built around a pay-as-you-go model.</p>

<p>If you have had an opportunity to read any of my blog posts or attended any session I’ve conducted at various conferences, you are probably aware that I am definitively a geek girl. I am absolutely enamored with all of the latest advancements that have been made in technology areas like cloud, artificial intelligence, internet of things and the maker space, as well as, with virtual reality and augmented reality. In my opinion, it is a wonderful time to be a geek. All the things that we dreamed about building while we sweated through our algorithms and discrete mathematics classes or the technology we marveled at when watching Star Wars and Star Trek are now coming to fruition. &nbsp;So hopefully this means it will only be a matter of time before I can hyperdrive to other galaxies in space, but until then I can at least build the 3D virtual reality and augmented reality characters and images like those featured in some of my favorite shows.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Sumerian-01-HeaderPic.png" /></p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sumerian/"><strong>Amazon Sumerian</strong></a> provides tools and resources that allows anyone to create and run augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and 3D applications with ease. &nbsp;With Sumerian, you can build multi-platform experiences that run on hardware like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus/pages/14586587011">Oculus</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HTC-VIVE-Virtual-Reality-System-pc/dp/B00VF5NT4I/">HTC Vive</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=node%3D7072561011&amp;field-keywords=apple">iOS devices </a>using WebVR compatible browsers and with support for ARCore on Android devices coming soon.</p> 
<p>This exciting new service, currently in preview, delivers features to allow you to design highly immersive and interactive 3D experiences from your browser. Some of these features are:</p> 
<li><strong>Editor:</strong> A web-based editor for constructing 3D scenes, importing assets, scripting interactions and special effects, with cross-platform publishing.</li> 
<li><strong>Object Library</strong>: a library of pre-built objects and templates.</li> 
<li><strong>Asset Import:</strong> Upload 3D assets to use in your scene. Sumerian supports importing FBX, OBJ, and coming soon Unity projects.</li> 
<li><strong>Scripting Library</strong>: provides a JavaScript scripting library via its 3D engine for advanced scripting capabilities.</li> 
<li><strong>Hosts</strong>: animated, lifelike 3D characters that can be customized for gender, voice, and language.</li> 
<li><strong>AWS Services Integration</strong>: baked in integration with Amazon Polly and Amazon Lex to add speech and natural language to into Sumerian hosts. Additionally, the scripting library can be used with AWS Lambda allowing use of the full range of AWS services.</li> 
<p>Since <strong>Amazon Sumerian</strong> doesn’t require you to have 3D graphics or programming experience to build rich, interactive VR and AR scenes, let’s take a quick run to the Sumerian Dashboard and check it out.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Sumerian-02-Dashboard-1.png" /></p> 
<p>From the Sumerian Dashboard, I can easily create a new scene with a push of a button.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Sumerian-03-CreateScene.png" /></p> 
<p>A default view of the new scene opens and is displayed in the Sumerian Editor. With the <strong>Tara Blog Scene</strong> opened in the editor, I can easily import assets into my scene.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Sumerian-04-Editor-1.png" /></p> 
<p>I’ll click the <strong>Import Asset</strong> button and pick an asset, View Room, to import into the scene. With the desired asset selected, I’ll click the <strong>Add</strong> button to import it.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Sumerian-05-ImportAsset-1.png" /></p> 
<p>Excellent, my asset was successfully imported into the Sumerian Editor and is shown in the Asset panel.&nbsp; Now, I have the option to add the View Room object into my scene by selecting it in the Asset panel and then dragging it onto the editor’s canvas.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Sumerian-05-ImportAsset-2.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Sumerian-06-ViewRoomScene-1.png" /></p> 
<p>I’ll repeat the import asset process and this time I will add the Mannequin asset to the scene.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Sumerian-07-MannequinAsset-1.png" /></p> 
<p>Additionally, with Sumerian, I can add scripting to Entity assets to make my scene even more exciting by adding a ScriptComponent to an entity and creating a script.&nbsp; I can use the provided built-in scripts or create my own custom scripts. If I create a new custom script, I will get a blank script with some base JavaScript code that looks similar to the code below.</p> 
<code class="lang-js">'use strict';
/* global sumerian */
//This is Me-- trying out the custom scripts - Tara
var setup = function (args, ctx) {
// Called when play mode starts.
};
var fixedUpdate = function (args, ctx) {
// Called on every physics update, after setup().
};
var update = function (args, ctx) {
// Called on every render frame, after setup().
};
var lateUpdate = function (args, ctx) {
// Called after all script &quot;update&quot; methods in the scene has been called.
};
var cleanup = function (args, ctx) {
// Called when play mode stops.
};
var parameters = [];</code> 
<p>Very cool, I just created a 3D scene using <strong>Amazon Sumerian</strong> in a matter of minutes and I have only scratched the surface.</p> 
<p><strong><u>Summary</u></strong></p> 
<p>The <strong>Amazon Sumerian</strong> service enables you to create, build, and run virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and 3D applications with ease.&nbsp; You don’t need any 3D graphics or specialized programming knowledge to get started building scenes and immersive experiences. &nbsp;You can import FBX, OBJ, and Unity projects in Sumerian, as well as upload your own 3D assets for use in your scene. In addition, you can create digital characters to narrate your scene and with these digital assets, you have choices for the character’s appearance, speech and behavior.</p> 
<p>You can <a href="https://docs.sumerian.amazonaws.com/tutorials/create/beginner/state-machine-basics/">learn more</a> about <strong>Amazon Sumerian</strong> and <a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/amazon-sumerian-preview.html">sign up for the preview</a> to get started with the new service on the product page.&nbsp; I can’t wait to see what rich experiences you all will build.</p>

<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/in_welcome_re_1.jpg">AWS re:Invent</a> campus, take a minute to think about your expectations for all of the elements that need to come together…</p> 
<p>Starting with the location, my colleagues have chosen the best venues, designed the sessions, picked the speakers, laid out the menu, selected the color schemes, programmed or printed all of the signs, and much more, all with the goal of creating an optimal learning environment for you and tens of thousands of other AWS customers.</p> 
<p>However, as is often the case, the part that you can see is just a part of the picture. Behind the scenes, people, processes, plans, and systems come together to put all of this infrastructure in to place and to make it run so smoothly that you don’t usually notice it.</p> 
<p>Today I would like to tell you about a mission-critical aspect of the re:Invent infrastructure that is actually underground. In addition to providing great Wi-Fi for your phones, tablets, cameras, laptops, and other devices, we need to make sure that a myriad of events, from the live-streamed keynotes, to the WorkSpaces-powered hands-on labs, are well-connected to each other and to the Internet. With events running at hotels up and down the Las Vegas Strip, reliable, low-latency connectivity is essential!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Thank You CenturyLink / Level3</strong></span><br /> Over the years we have been working with the great folks at Level3 to make this happen. They recently became part of <a href="http://www.centurylink.com/">CenturyLink</a> and are now the Official Network Sponsor of re:Invent, responsible for the network fiber, circuits, and services that tie the re:Invent campus together.</p> 
<p>To make this happen, they set up two miles of dark fiber beneath the Strip, routed to multiple Availability Zones in two separate AWS Regions. The Sands Expo Center is equipped with redundant 10 gigabit connections and the other venues (Aria, MGM, Mirage, and Wynn) are each provisioned for 2 to 10 gigabits, meaning that over half of the Strip is enabled for Direct Connect. According to the IT manager at one of the facilities, this may be the largest temporary hybrid network ever configured in Las Vegas.</p> 
<p>On the Wi-Fi side, <a href="https://www.shownets.net/">showNets</a> is plugged in to the same network; your devices are talking directly to Direct Connect access points (how cool is that?).</p> 
<p>Here’s a simplified illustration of how it all fits together:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/show_network_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The CenturyLink team will be onsite at re:Invent and will be tweeting live network stats throughout the week.</p> 
<p>I hope you have enjoyed this quick look behind the scenes and beneath the street!</p>

<p>Our customers are using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot" title="">AWS IoT</a> to make their connected devices more intelligent. These devices collect &amp; measure data in the field (below the ground, in the air, in the water, on factory floors and in hospital rooms) and use <span title="">AWS IoT</span> as their gateway to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" title="">AWS Cloud</a>. Once connected to the cloud, customers can write device data to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" title="">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, process data using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/" title="">Amazon Kinesis</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> functions, initiate <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns/" title="">Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)</a> push notifications, and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-rule-actions.html">much more</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Pricing Model (20-40% Reduction)</strong></span><br /> Today we are making a change to the <span title="">AWS IoT</span> pricing model that will make it an even better value for you. Most customers will see a price reduction of 20-40%, with some receiving a significantly larger discount depending on their workload.</p> 
<p>The original model was based on a charge for the number of messages that were sent to or from the service. This all-inclusive model was a good starting point, but also meant that some customers were effectively paying for parts of <span title="">AWS IoT</span> that they did not actually use. For example, some customers have devices that ping <span title="">AWS IoT</span> very frequently, with sparse rule sets that fire infrequently. Our new model is more fine-grained, with independent charges for each component (all prices are for devices that connect to the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span> Region):</p> 
<p><strong>Connectivity</strong> – Metered in 1 minute increments and based on the total time your devices are connected to <span title="">AWS IoT</span>. Priced at $0.08 per million minutes of connection (equivalent to $0.042 per device per year for 24/7 connectivity). Your devices can send keep-alive pings at 30 second to 20 minute intervals at no additional cost.</p> 
<p><strong>Messaging</strong> – Metered by the number of messages transmitted between your devices and <span title="">AWS IoT</span>. Pricing starts at $1 per million messages, with volume pricing falling as low as $0.70 per million. You may send and receive messages up to 128 kilobytes in size. Messages are metered in 5 kilobyte increments (up from 512 bytes previously). For example, an 8 kilobyte message is metered as two messages.</p> 
<p><strong>Rules Engine</strong> – Metered for each time a rule is triggered, and for the number of actions executed within a rule, with a minimum of one action per rule. Priced at $0.15 per million rules-triggered and $0.15 per million actions-executed. Rules that process a message in excess of 5 kilobytes are metered at the next multiple of the 5 kilobyte size. For example, a rule that processes an 8 kilobyte message is metered as two rules.</p> 
<p><strong>Device Shadow &amp; Registry Updates</strong> – Metered on the number of operations to access or modify Device Shadow or Registry data, priced at $1.25 per million operations. Device Shadow and Registry operations are metered in 1 kilobyte increments of the Device Shadow or Registry record size. For example, an update to a 1.5 kilobyte Shadow record is metered as two operations.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" title="">AWS Free Tier</a> now offers a generous allocation of connection minutes, messages, triggered rules, rules actions, Shadow, and Registry usage, enough to operate a fleet of up to 50 devices. The new prices will take effect on January 1, 2018 with no effort on your part. At that time, the updated prices will be published on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-platform/pricing/">AWS IoT Pricing</a> page.</p>
