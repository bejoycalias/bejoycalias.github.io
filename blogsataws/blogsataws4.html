<p>Happy 2018! I am looking forward to getting back to my usual routine, working with our teams to learn about their upcoming launches and then writing blog posts to bring the news to you. Right now I am still catching up on a few launches and announcements from late 2017.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/"><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2018/dc_aag_1.png">AWS Direct Connect</a>. AWS customers all over the world use Direct Connect to create dedicated network connections from their premises to AWS in order to reduce their network costs, increase throughput, and to pursue a more consistent network experience.</p> 
<p>We added ten new locations to our Direct Connect roster in December, all of which offer both 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps connectivity, along with partner-supplied options for speeds below 1 Gbps. Here are the newest locations, along withe the data centers and associated AWS Regions:</p> 
<li>Bangalore, India – <a href="https://www.netmagicsolutions.com/netmagic-datacenter-vikhroli-mumbai">NetMagic DC2</a> – <span title="">Asia Pacific (Mumbai)</span>.</li> 
<li>Cape Town, South Africa – <a href="https://www.teraco.co.za/locations/cape-town.html">Teraco Ct1</a> – <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span>.</li> 
<li>Johannesburg, South Africa – <a href="https://www.teraco.co.za/locations/johannesburg.html">Teraco JB1</a> – <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span>.</li> 
<li>London, UK – <a href="http://www.telehouse.net/data-centres/emea/uk-data-centres/london-data-centres/north-two"> Telehouse North Two</a> – <span title="">EU (London)</span>.</li> 
<li>Miami, Florida, US – <a href="https://www.equinix.com/locations/united-states-colocation/miami-data-center/mi1/">Equinix MI1</a> – <span title="">US East (N. Virginia)</span>.</li> 
<li>Minneapolis, Minnesota, US – <a href="http://www.cologix.com/data-centers/minneapolis/min3/">Cologix MIN3</a> – <span title="">US East (Ohio)</span></li> 
<li>Ningxia, China – Shapotou IDC – <span title="">China (Ningxia)</span>.</li> 
<li>Ningxia, China – Industrial Park IDC – <span title="">China (Ningxia)</span>.</li> 
<li>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil – <a href="https://www.equinix.com/locations/brazil-colocation/rio-de-janeiro-data-centers/rj2/">Equinix RJ2</a>– <span title="">South America (S&atilde;o Paulo)</span>.</li> 
<li>Tokyo, Japan – <a href="http://www.attokyo.com/">AT Tokyo Chuo</a> – <span title="">Asia Pacific (Tokyo)</span>.</li> 
<p>You can use these new locations in conjunction with the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-direct-connect-gateway-inter-region-vpc-access/">AWS Direct Connect Gateway</a> to set up connectivity that spans Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) spread across multiple AWS Regions (this does not apply to the AWS Regions in China).</p> 
<p>If you are interested in putting Direct Connect to use, be sure to check out our ever-growing list of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/partners/">Direct Connect Partners</a>.</p>

<p>I’m getting ready to wrap up my work for the year, cleaning up my inbox and catching up on a few recent AWS launches that happened at and shortly after <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a>.</p> 
<p>Last week we launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/" title="">Amazon Linux 2</a>. This is modern version of Linux, designed to meet the security, stability, and productivity needs of enterprise environments while giving you timely access to new tools and features. It also includes all of the things that made the Amazon Linux AMI popular, including AWS integration, <a href="https://cloud-init.io/">cloud-init</a>, a secure default configuration, regular security updates, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support</a>. From that base, we have added many new features including:</p> 
<p><strong>Long-Term Support</strong> – You can use <span title="">Amazon Linux 2</span> in situations where you want to stick with a single major version of Linux for an extended period of time, perhaps to avoid re-qualifying your applications too frequently. This build (2017.12) is a candidate for LTS status; the final determination will be made based on feedback in the <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=228">Amazon Linux Discussion Forum</a>. Long-term support for the Amazon Linux 2 LTS build will include security updates, bug fixes, user-space Application Binary Interface (ABI), and user-space Application Programming Interface (API) compatibility for 5 years.</p> 
<p><strong>Extras Library</strong> – You can now get fast access to fresh, new functionality while keeping your base OS image stable and lightweight. The Amazon Linux Extras Library eliminates the age-old tradeoff between OS stability and access to fresh software. It contains open source databases, languages, and more, each packaged together with any needed dependencies.</p> 
<p><strong>Tuned Kernel</strong> – You have access to the latest 4.9 LTS kernel, with support for the latest EC2 features and tuned to run efficiently in AWS and other virtualized environments.</p> 
<p><strong>Systemd</strong> – <span title="">Amazon Linux 2</span> includes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd">systemd</a> init system, designed to provide better boot performance and increased control over individual services and groups of interdependent services. For example, you can indicate that Service B must be started only after Service A is fully started, or that Service C should start on a change in network connection status.</p> 
<p><strong>Wide Availabilty</strong> – <span title="">Amazon Linux 2</span> is available in all AWS Regions in AMI and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/amazonlinux/">Docker image</a> form. <a href="https://cdn.amazonlinux.com/os-images/2017.12.0.20171212.2/">Virtual machine images</a> for Hyper-V, KVM, VirtualBox, and VMware are also available. You can build and test your applications on your laptop or in your own data center and then deploy them to AWS.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Launching an Instance</strong></span><br /> You can launch an instance in all of the usual ways – <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/powershell/" title="">AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell</a>, <code><a title="undefined" href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html" target="null">RunInstances</a></code>, and via a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" title="">AWS CloudFormation</a> template. I’ll use the Console:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/al2_console_launch_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I’m interested in the Extras Library; here’s how I see which topics (lists of packages) are available:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/al2_see_extras_2.png" /></p> 
<p>As you can see, the library includes languages, editors, and web tools that receive frequent updates. Each topic contains all of dependencies that are needed to install the package on <span title="">Amazon Linux 2</span>. For example, the <strong>Rust</strong> topic includes the <a href="http://alexcrichton.com/cmake-rs/cmake/index.html">cmake</a> build system for Rust, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo">cargo</a> for Rust package maintenance, and the LLVM-based compiler toolchain for Rust.</p> 
<p>Here’s how I install a topic (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/news/NEWS.25.3">Emacs 25.3</a>):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/al2_install_extras_emacs_1.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>SNS Updates</strong></span><br /> Many AWS customers use the Amazon Linux AMIs as a starting point for their own AMIs. If you do this and would like to kick off your build process whenever a new AMI is released, you can <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/amazon-linux-ami-basics.html#linux-ami-notifications">subscribe to an SNS topic</a>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/al2_sub_sns_topic_2.png" /></p> 
<p>You can be notified by email, invoke a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> function, and so forth.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/" title="">Amazon Linux 2</a> is available now and you can start using it in the cloud and on-premises today! To learn more, read the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/release-notes/">Amazon Linux 2 LTS Candidate (2017.12) Release Notes</a>.</p>

Check out the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">AWS Global Infrastructure</a> page to learn more about current and future AWS Regions.</p> 
<p>The Paris Region will benefit from three AWS Direct Connect locations. Telehouse Voltaire is available today. AWS Direct Connect will also become available at Equinix Paris in early 2018, followed by Interxion Paris.</p> 
<p>All AWS infrastructure regions around the world are designed, built, and regularly audited to meet the most rigorous compliance standards and to provide high levels of security for all AWS customers. These include ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, SOC 1 (Formerly SAS 70), SOC 2 and SOC 3 Security &amp; Availability, PCI DSS Level 1, and many more.

<p>AWS is certified under the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">EU-US Privacy Shield</a>, and the AWS Data Processing Addendum (DPA) is GDPR-ready and available now to all AWS customers to help them prepare for May 25, 2018 when the GDPR becomes enforceable. The current AWS DPA, as well as the AWS GDPR DPA, allows customers to transfer personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in compliance with European Union (EU) data protection laws. AWS also adheres to the <a href="https://cispe.cloud/">Cloud Infrastructure Service Providers in Europe</a> (CISPE) <a href="https://cispe.cloud/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>. The CISPE Code of Conduct helps customers ensure that AWS is using appropriate data protection standards to protect their data, consistent with the GDPR. In addition, AWS offers a wide range of services and features to help customers meet the requirements of the GDPR, including services for access controls, monitoring, logging, and encryption.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>From Our Customers</strong></span><br /> Many AWS customers are preparing to use this new Region. Here’s a small sample:</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.societegenerale.com/en/home">Societe Generale</a>, one of the largest banks in France and the world, has accelerated their digital transformation while working with AWS. They developed SG Research, an application that makes reports from Societe Generale’s analysts available to corporate customers in order to improve the decision-making process for investments. The new AWS Region will reduce latency between applications running in the cloud and in their French data centers.</p> 
<p><a href="http://www.sncf.com/">SNCF</a> is the national railway company of France. Their mobile app, powered by AWS, delivers real-time traffic information to 14 million riders. Extreme weather, traffic events, holidays, and engineering works can cause usage to peak at hundreds of thousands of users per second. They are planning to use machine learning and big data to add predictive features to the app.</p> 
<p><a href="http://www.radiofrance.fr/">Radio France</a>, the French public radio broadcaster, offers seven national networks, and uses AWS to accelerate its innovation and stay competitive.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.restosducoeur.org/">Les Restos du Coeur</a>, a French charity that provides assistance to the needy, delivering food packages and participating in their social and economic integration back into French society. Les Restos du Coeur is using AWS for its CRM system to track the assistance given to each of their beneficiaries and the impact this is having on their lives.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.alloresto.fr/">AlloResto</a> by JustEat (a leader in the <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20150717-future-food-tech-french-american-startups-wine-soylent-supercook-ruche">French FoodTech</a> industry), is using AWS to to scale during traffic peaks and to accelerate their innovation process.</p>

<p>In the past I’ve talked about several agents, deaemons, and scripts that you could use to collect system metrics and log files for your Windows and Linux instances and on-premise services and publish them to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" title="">Amazon CloudWatch</a>. The data collected by this somewhat disparate collection of tools gave you visibility into the status and behavior of your compute resources, along with the power to take action when a value goes out of range and indicates a potential issue. You can graph any desired metrics on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudwatch-dashboards-create-use-customized-metrics-views/">CloudWatch Dashboards</a>, initiate actions via <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html">CloudWatch Alarms</a>, and search <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/improvements-to-cloudwatch-logs-dashboards/">CloudWatch Logs</a> to find error messages, while taking advantage of our support for custom <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-high-resolution-custom-metrics-and-alarms-for-amazon-cloudwatch/">high-resolution metrics</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Unified Agent</strong></span><br /> Today we are taking a nice step forward and launching a new, unified CloudWatch Agent. It runs in the cloud and on-premises, on Linux and Windows instances and servers, and handles metrics and log files. You can deploy it using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/features/">AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Run Command</a>, <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-state.html">SSM State Manager</a>, or from the CLI. Here are some of the most important <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html">features</a>:</p> 
<p><strong>Single Agent</strong> – A single agent now collects both metrics and logs. This simplifies the setup process and reduces complexity.</p> 
<p><strong>Cross-Platform / Cross-Environment</strong> – The new agent runs in the cloud and on-premises, on 64-bit Linux and 64-bit Windows, and includes HTTP proxy server support.</p> 
<p><strong>Configurable</strong> – The new agent captures the most useful system metrics automatically. It can be configured to collect hundreds of others, including fine-grained metrics on sub-resources such as CPU threads, mounted filesystems, and network interfaces.</p> 
<p><strong>CloudWatch-Friendly</strong> – The new agent supports standard 1-minute metrics and the newer 1-second high-resolution metrics. It automatically includes EC2 dimensions such as Instance Id, Image Id, and Auto Scaling Group Name, and also supports the use of custom dimensions. All of the dimensions can be used for custom aggregation across Auto Scaling Groups, applications, and so forth.</p> 
<p><strong>Migration</strong> – You can easily <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/monitoring-cwagent.html">migrate</a> existing AWS SSM and EC2Config configurations for use with the new agent.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Installing the Agent</strong></span><br /> The CloudWatch Agent uses an <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">IAM role</a> when running on an EC2 instance, and an <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html">IAM user</a> when running on an on-premises server. I used the <strong>AmazonSSMFullAccess</strong> and <strong>AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess</strong> policies because I was a bit short on time, but I could have also followed the directions at <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create-iam-roles-for-cloudwatch-agent.html">Create IAM Roles and Users for Use With CloudWatch Agent</a> to create a fine-tuned custom policy. Here’s my role:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_agent_role_2.png" /></p> 
<p>I can easily add it to a running instance (this is a relatively new and very handy EC2 feature):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_attach_role_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The SSM Agent is already running on my instance. If it wasn’t, I would follow the steps in <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html">Installing and Configuring SSM Agent</a> to set it up.</p> 
<p>Next, I install the CloudWatch Agent using the AWS Systems Manager:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_run_install_agent_1.png" /></p> 
<p>This takes just a few seconds. Now I can use a simple wizard to set up the configuration file for the agent:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_wizard_pt1_2.png" /></p> 
<p>The wizard also lets me set up the log files to be monitored:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_wizard_pt2_3.png" /></p> 
<p>The wizard generates a JSON-format config file and stores it on the instance. It also offers me the option to upload the file to my Parameter Store so that I can deploy it to my other instances (I can also do fine-grained customization of the metrics and log collection configuration by editing the file):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_wizard_pt3_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Now I can start the CloudWatch Agent using Run Command, supplying the name of my configuration in the Parameter Store:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_run_start_agent_1.png" /></p> 
<p>This runs in a few seconds and the agent begins to publish metrics right away. As I mentioned earlier, the agent can publish fine-grained metrics on the resources inside of or attached to an instance. For example, here are the metrics for each filesystem:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_metrics_fs_1.png" /></p> 
<p>There’s a separate log stream for each monitored log file on each instance:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_log_streams_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I can view and search it, just like I can do for any other log stream:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/cw_a_log_stream_1.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Now Available</strong></span><br /> The new CloudWatch Agent is available now and you can start using it today in all public AWS Regions, with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/" title="">AWS GovCloud (US)</a> and the Regions in China to follow.</p> 
<p>There’s no charge for the agent; you pay the usual <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/">CloudWatch prices</a> for logs and custom metrics.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Operating Partner</strong></span><br /> To comply with China’s legal and regulatory requirements, AWS has formed a strategic technology collaboration with NWCD to operate and provide services from the AWS <span title="">China (Ningxia)</span> Region. Founded in 2015, NWCD is a licensed datacenter and cloud services provider, based in Ningxia, China. NWCD joins Sinnet, the operator of the AWS <span title="">China (Beijing)</span> Region, as an AWS operating partner in China. Through these relationships, AWS provides its industry-leading technology, guidance, and expertise to NWCD and Sinnet, while NWCD and Sinnet operate and provide AWS cloud services to local customers. While the cloud services offered in both AWS China Regions are the same as those available in other AWS Regions, the AWS China Regions are different in that they are isolated from all other AWS Regions and operated by AWS’s Chinese partners separately from all other AWS Regions. Customers using the AWS China Regions enter into customer agreements with Sinnet and NWCD, rather than with AWS.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Use it Today</strong></span><br /> The AWS <span title="">China (Ningxia)</span> Region, operated by NWCD, is open for business, and you can start using it now! Starting today, Chinese developers, startups, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and non-profit organizations, can leverage AWS to run their applications and store their data in the new AWS <span title="">China (Ningxia)</span> Region, operated by NWCD. Customers already using the <span title="">China (Beijing)</span> Region, operated by Sinnet, can select the AWS <span title="">China (Ningxia)</span> Region directly from the AWS Management Console, while new customers can request an account at <a href="http://www.amazonaws.cn/">www.amazonaws.cn</a> to begin using both AWS China Regions.</p>

<p>My colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandyacarter/">Sandy Carter</a> delivered the Enterprise Innovation State of the Union last week at <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a>. She wrote the guest post below to recap the announcements that she made from the stage.</p> 
<p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffbarr">Jeff</a>;</p> 
<hr /> 
<p>“I want my company to innovate, but I am not convinced we can execute successfully.” Far too many times I have heard this fear expressed by senior executives that I have met at different points in my career. In fact, a <a href="https://www.pwc.lu/en/advisory/docs/pwc-breakthrough-innovation-and-growth.pdf">recent study</a> published by Price Waterhouse Coopers found that while 93% of executives depend on innovation to drive growth, more than half are challenged to take innovative ideas to market quickly in a scalable way.</p> 
<p>Many customers are struggling with how to drive enterprise innovation, so I was thrilled to share the stage at AWS re:Invent this past week with several senior executives who have successfully broken this mold to drive amazing enterprise innovation. In particular, I want to thank <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paragkarnik/">Parag Karnik</a> from Johnson &amp; Johnson, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-rothe-4343288/">Bill Rothe</a> from Hess Corporation, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ukdavew/">Dave Williams</a> from Just Eat, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olgavlagunova/">Olga Lagunova</a> from Pitney Bowes for sharing their stories of innovation, creativity, and solid execution.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/aws_heart_windows_2.png" /></p> 
<p>Among the many new announcements from AWS this past week, I am particularly excited about the following newly-launched AWS products and programs that I announced at re:Invent to drive new innovations by our enterprise customers:</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AI: New Deep Learning Amazon Machine Image (AMI) on EC2 Windows</strong></span><br /> As I shared at re:Invent, customers such as <a href="http://www.infor.com/">Infor</a> are already successfully leveraging artificial intelligence tools on AWS to deliver tailored, industry-specific applications to their customers. We want to facilitate more of our Windows developers to get started quickly and easily with AI, leveraging machine learning based tools with popular deep learning frameworks, such as Apache <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mxnet/" title="">MXNet</a>, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" title="">TensorFlow</a>, and <a href="https://caffe2.ai/" title="">Caffe2</a>. In order to enable this, I announced at re:Invent that AWS now offers a new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/amis/">Deep Learning AMI</a> for Microsoft Windows. The AMI is tailored to facilitate large scale training of deep-learning models, and enables quick and easy setup of Windows Server-based compute resources for machine learning applications.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>IoT: Visualize and Analyze SQL and IoT Data</strong></span><br /> Forecasts show as many as <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/471264/iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide/">31 billion IoT devices by 2020</a>. AWS wants every Windows customer to take advantage of the data available from their devices. Pitney Bowes, for example, now has more than 130,000 IoT devices streaming data to AWS. Using machine learning, Pitney Bowes enriches and analyzes data to enhance their customer experience, improve efficiencies, and create new data products. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/announcing-aws-iot-analytics/">AWS IoT Analytics</a> can now be leveraged to run analytics on IoT data and get insights that help you make better and more accurate decisions for IoT applications and machine learning use cases. AWS IoT Analytics can <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/launch-presenting-aws-iot-analytics/">automatically enrich IoT device data with contextual metadata</a> such as your SQL Server transactional data.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Capabilities for .NET Developers on AWS</strong></span><br /> In addition to all of the enhancements we’ve introduced to deliver a first class experience to Windows developers on AWS, we announced that we are including .NET Core 2.0 support in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/" title="">AWS CodeBuild</a>, which will be available for broader use early next year. .NET Core 2.0 packs a number of new features such as Razor pages, better compatibility with .NET framework, more than double the number of APIs compared to the previous versions, and much more. With this announcement, you will be able to take advantage of all latest .NET Core features on Lambda and CodeBuild for building modern serverless and DevOps centric solutions.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Simplified Backup for Windows Applications</strong></span><br /> We recently introduced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/amazon-ec2-now-offers-application-consistent-snapshots-with-microsoft-vss/">application consistent snapshots with Microsoft Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS)</a>. This enables you to take <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee923636.aspx">VSS</a> snapshots with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/" title="">Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)</a> for your running Windows instances without the need to create custom scripts or to shut down the instances. This removes the overhead associated with backing up your Windows applications.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>License optimization for BYOL</strong></span><br /> AWS provides you a wide variety of instance types and families that best meet your workload needs. If you are using software licensed by the number of vCPUs, you want the ability to further tweak vCPU count to optimize license spend. I announced the upcoming ability to optimize CPUs for EC2, giving you greater control over your EC2 instances on two fronts:</p> 
<ol> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em">You can specify a custom number of vCPUs when launching new instances to save on vCPU based licensing costs. For example, SQL Server licensing spend.</li> 
<li>You can disable Hyper-Threading Technology for workloads that perform well with single-threaded CPUs, like some high-performance computing (HPC) applications.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Using these capabilities, customers who bring their own license (BYOL) will be able to optimize their license usage and save on the license costs.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Server Migration Service for Hyper-V Virtual Machines</strong></span><br /> As Bill Rothe from Hess Corporation shared at re:Invent, Hess has successfully migrated a wide range of workloads to the cloud, including SQL Server, SharePoint, SAP HANA, and many others. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/server-migration-service/">AWS Server Migration Service</a> (SMS) now supports <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/server-migration-service/faqs/#hyper-v">Hyper-V virtual machine (VM) migration</a>, in order to further support enterprise migrations like these. AWS Server Migration Service will enable you to more easily co-ordinate large-scale server migrations from on-premise Hyper-V environments to AWS. AWS Server Migration Service allows you to automate, schedule, and track incremental replications of live server volumes. The replicated volumes are encrypted in transit and saved as a new Amazon Machine Image (AMI), which can be launched as an EC2 instance on AWS.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Microsoft Premier Support for AWS End-Customers</strong></span><br /> I was pleased to announce that Microsoft and AWS have developed new areas of support integration to help ensure a great customer experience. Microsoft Premier Support is on board to help AWS assist end customers. AWS Support engineers can escalate directly to Microsoft Support on behalf of AWS customers running Microsoft workloads.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Best Practice Tools: HIPAA Compliance and Digital Innovation Workshop</strong></span><br /> In November, we updated our <a href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_HIPAA_Compliance_Whitepaper.pdf">HIPAA-focused white paper</a>, outlining how you can use AWS to create HIPAA-compliant applications. In the first quarter of next year, we will publish a HIPAA Implementation Guide that expands on our <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/accelerator-hipaa/">HIPAA Quick Start</a> to enable you to follow strict security, compliance, and risk management controls for common healthcare use cases. I was also pleased to award a Digital Innovation Workshop to one of our customers in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9CGyYJdXLU">my re:Invent session</a>, and look forward to seeing more customers take advantage of this workshop.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS: The Continuous Innovation Cloud</strong></span><br /> A common thread we see across customers is that continuous innovation from AWS enables their ongoing reinvention. Continuous innovation means that you are always getting a newer, better offering every single day. Sometimes it is in the form of brand new services and capabilities, and sometimes it is happening invisibly, under the covers where your environment just keeps getting better. I invite you to learn more about how you can accelerate your innovation journey with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/new/reinvent/">recently launched AWS services</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloud-migration">AWS best practices</a>. If you are migrating Windows workloads, speak with your AWS sales representative or an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/windows/partner-solutions/">AWS Microsoft Workloads Competency Partner</a> to learn how you can leverage our re:Think for Windows program for credits to start your migration.</p>

<p><strong>Post by <a href="https://twitter.com/mza">Dr. Matt Wood</a><br /> </strong></p> 
<p>Today AWS announced contributions to the milestone 1.0 release of the <a href="http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/get_started/install.html">Apache MXNet</a> deep learning engine including the introduction of a new model-serving capability for MXNet. The new capabilities in MXNet provide the following benefits to users:</p> 
<p>1) <em>MXNet is easier to use</em>: The model server for MXNet is a new capability introduced by AWS, and it packages, runs, and serves deep learning models in seconds with just a few lines of code, making them accessible over the internet via an API endpoint and thus easy to integrate into applications. The 1.0 release also includes an advanced indexing capability that enables users to perform matrix operations in a more intuitive manner.</p> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em"><strong>Model Serving enables set up of an API endpoint for prediction: </strong>It saves developers time and effort by condensing the task of setting up an API endpoint for running and integrating prediction functionality into an application to just a few lines of code. It bridges the barrier between Python-based deep learning frameworks and production systems through a Docker container-based deployment model.</li> 
<li><strong>Advanced indexing for array operations in MXNet: </strong>It is now more intuitive for developers to leverage the powerful array operations in MXNet. They can use the advanced indexing capability by leveraging existing knowledge of <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a>/<a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> arrays. For example, it supports MXNet NDArray and Numpy ndarray as index, e.g. (<code>a[mx.nd.array([1,2], dtype = ‘int32’]</code>).</li> 
<p>2) <em>MXNet is faster</em>: The 1.0 release includes implementation of cutting-edge features that optimize the performance of training and inference. Gradient compression enables users to train models up to five times faster by reducing communication bandwidth between compute nodes without loss in convergence rate or accuracy. For speech recognition acoustic modeling like the Alexa voice, this feature can reduce network bandwidth by up to three orders of magnitude during training. With the support of <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl">NVIDIA Collective Communication Library</a> (NCCL), users can train a model 20% faster on multi-GPU systems.</p> 
<li style="padding-bottom: 1em"><strong>Optimize network bandwidth with gradient compression: </strong>In distributed training, each machine must communicate frequently with others to update the weight-vectors and thereby collectively build a single model, leading to high network traffic. Gradient compression algorithm enables users to train models up to five times faster by compressing the model changes communicated by each instance.</li> 
<li><strong>Optimize the training performance by taking advantage of NCCL: </strong>NCCL implements multi-GPU and multi-node collective communication primitives that are performance optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. NCCL provides communication routines that are optimized to achieve high bandwidth over interconnection between multi-GPUs. MXNet supports NCCL to train models about 20% faster on multi-GPU systems.</li> 
<p>3) <em>MXNet provides easy interoperability</em>: MXNet now includes a tool for converting neural network code written with the Caffe framework to MXNet code, making it easier for users to take advantage of MXNet’s scalability and performance.</p> 
<li><strong>Migrate Caffe models to MXNet: </strong>It is now possible to easily migrate Caffe code to MXNet, using the new source code translation tool for converting Caffe code to MXNet code.</li> 
<p>MXNet has helped developers and researchers make progress with everything from language translation to autonomous vehicles and behavioral biometric security. We are excited to see the broad base of users that are building production artificial intelligence applications powered by neural network models developed and trained with MXNet. For example, the autonomous driving company <a href="http://www.tusimple.com/index-en.html">TuSimple</a> recently piloted a self-driving truck on a 200-mile journey from Yuma, Arizona to San Diego, California using MXNet. This release also includes a full-featured and performance optimized version of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-gluon-a-new-library-for-machine-learning-from-aws-and-microsoft/">Gluon</a> programming interface. The ease-of-use associated with it combined with the extensive set of tutorials has led significant adoption among developers new to deep learning. The flexibility of the interface has driven interest within the research community, especially in the natural language processing domain.</p> 
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Getting started with MXNet</span></strong><br /> Getting started with <a href="http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/install/index.html">MXNet</a>&nbsp;is simple. To learn more about the Gluon interface and deep learning, you can reference this <a href="http://gluon.mxnet.io/">comprehensive set of tutorials</a>, which covers everything from an introduction to deep learning to how to implement cutting-edge neural network models. If you’re a contributor to a machine learning framework, check out the interface specs on <a href="https://github.com/gluon-api/gluon-api/">GitHub</a>.</p> 
<p>To get started with the Model Server for Apache MXNet, install the library with the following command:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">$ pip install mxnet-model-server</code> 
<p>The Model Server library has a Model Zoo with 10 pre-trained deep learning models, including the <a href="https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet">SqueezeNet</a> 1.1 object classification model. You can start serving the SqueezeNet model with just the following command:</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">$ mxnet-model-server \
--models squeezenet=https://s3.amazonaws.com/model-server/models/squeezenet_v1.1/squeezenet_v1.1.model \
--service dms/model_service/mxnet_vision_service.py</code>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/" title="">Serverless</a> applications have become mainstream more quickly than I ever could have imagined. Every second of every day, countless <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> functions spring to life on an as-needed basis, take care of some critical business function, and then finish up. Our users tell us that they love the flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of this model.</p> 
<p>We want to make sure that every AWS customer moves ahead into the serverless future. After the launch of Lambda, we followed up with the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model">Serverless Application Model</a> (SAM) to further simplify the process of deploying and managing serverless applications on AWS. We have also published serverless reference architectures for <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-webapp">web apps</a>, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-mobilebackend">mobile backends</a>, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-imagerecognition">image recognition &amp; processing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-fileprocessing">real-time file processing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-iotbackend">IoT</a>, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-mapreduce">MapReduce</a>, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-streamprocessing">real-time stream processing</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-refarch-imagemoderationchatbot">image moderation for chatbots</a>.</p> 
<p>Today I would like to tell you about the next step forward. We want to make it as easy as possible for AWS customers to discover and deploy serverless apps. We also want to strengthen the open source community around Lambda, SAM, and serverless apps, with room for everyone to share, participate, and benefit.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS Serverless Application Repository</strong></span><br /> <img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/sar_box_1.png">AWS Serverless Application Repository</a>. Designed for producers and consumers of serverless apps, this AWS Console component supports publishing, discovery, and deployment.</p> 
<p>Producers (developers, ISVs, SaaS providers, and AWS partners) can easily publish to the repository. Apps must be in SAM format, accompanied by a <a href="https://spdx.org/">SPDX</a> license identifier, with options to share globally (for all AWS customers) or privately (with access controls for individuals and teams). Source code and other application components can be stored in <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or another source code repository, and then included via reference; again with control over sharing.</p> 
<p>We’re looking forward to your submission. It will join others in progress from Datadog, Here, Splunk, and SignalFx.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>For Publishers</strong></span><br /> If you are already using SAM to build serverless apps, we’re just about ready to start accepting contributions. As a quick refresher, SAM lets you define <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/apigateway" title="">Amazon API Gateway</a> APIs, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" title="">Amazon DynamoDB</a> tables, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> functions that are triggered by API actions and uploads to S3. Your serverless app can use third-party libraries as long as they are available under an open source license that has been approved by the <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> (OSI). You will be able to use resource-based IAM policies to control access to your app—you can keep it private, grant cross-account access on an extremely selective basis, or make it available publicly.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>For Consumers</strong></span><br /> You will be able to find and start using the apps from the Lambda console:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/sar_find_app_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You will also be able to check on the status of each app:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/sar_app_status_1.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Stay Tuned</strong></span><br /> All of this functionality will be accessible from the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>, and a rich set of APIs. I’ll be sharing more info as it becomes available.</p> 
<p>If you are ready to get started, you can <a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/serverlessrepo-preview.html">sign up for the Preview</a>!</p>
