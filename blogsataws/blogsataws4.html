<p>I <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/low-cost-burstable-ec2-instances/">first wrote about</a> the T2 instances in the summer of 2014, and talked about how many workloads have a modest demand for continuous compute power and an occasional need for a lot more. This model resonated with our customers; the T2 instances are very popular and are now used to host microservices, low-latency interactive applications, virtual desktops, build &amp; staging environments, prototypes, and the like.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t2/"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New T2 Unlimited</strong></span></a><br /> Today we are extending the burst model that we pioneered with the T2, giving you the ability to sustain high CPU performance over any desired time frame while still keeping your costs as low as possible. You simply enable this feature when you launch your instance; you can also enable it for an instance that is already running. The hourly T2 instance price covers all interim spikes in usage if the average CPU utilization is lower than the baseline over a 24-hour window. There’s a small hourly charge if the instance runs at higher CPU utilization for a prolonged period of time. For example, if you run a <strong>t2.micro</strong> instance at an average of 15% utilization (5% above the baseline) for 24 hours you will be charged an additional 6 cents (5 cents per vCPU-hour * 1 vCPU * 5% * 24 hours).</p> 
<p>To launch a T2 Unlimited instance from the EC2 Console, select any T2 instance and then click on<strong> Enable</strong> next to <strong>T2 Unlimited</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/t2_unlimited_launch_2.png" /></p> 
<p>And here’s how to switch a running instance from T2 Standard to T2 Unlimited:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/t2_switch_to_unlimited_2.png" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Behind the Scenes</strong></span><br /> As I described in my original post, each T2 instance accumulates CPU Credits as it runs and consumes them while it is running at full-core speed, decelerating to a baseline level when the supply of Credits is exhausted. T2 Unlimited instances have the ability to borrow an entire day’s worth of future credits, allowing them to perform additional bursting. This borrowing is tracked by the new <strong>CPUSurplusCreditBalance</strong> CloudWatch metric. When this balance rises to the level where it represents an entire day’s worth of future credits, the instance continues to deliver full-core performance, charged at the rate of $0.05 per vCPU per hour for Linux and $0.096 for Windows. These charged surplus credits are tracked by the new <strong>CPUSurplusCreditsCharged</strong> metric. You will be charged on a per-millisecond basis for partial hours of bursting (further reducing your costs) if you exhaust your surplus late in a given hour.</p> 
<p>The charge for any remaining <strong>CPUSurplusCreditBalance</strong> is processed when the instance is terminated or configured as a T2 Standard. Any accumulated <strong>CPUCreditBalance</strong> carries over during the transition to T2 Standard.</p> 
<p>The T2 Unlimited model is designed to spare you the trouble of watching the CloudWatch metrics, but (if you are like me) you will do it anyway. Let’s take a quick look at a <strong>t2.nano </strong>and watch the credits over time. First, CPU utilization grows to 100% and the instance begins to consume 5 credits every 5 minutes (one credit is equivalent to a VCPU-minute):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/t2u_usage_1.png" /></p> 
<p>The CPU credit balance remains at 0 because the credits are being produced and consumed at the same rate. The surplus credit balance (tracked by the <strong>CPUSurplusCreditBalance</strong> metric) ramps up to 72, representing the credits that are being borrowed from the future:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/t2u_cred_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Once the surplus credit balance hits 72, there’s nothing more to borrow from the future, and any further CPU usage is charged at the end of the hour, tracked with the <strong>CPUSurplusCreditsCharged</strong> metric. The instance consumes 5 credits every 5 minutes and earns 0.25, resulting in a net charge of 4.75 VCPU-minutes for each 5 minutes of bursting:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/t2u_charge_1.png" /></p> 
<p>You can switch each of your instances back and forth between T2 Standard and T2 Unlimited at any time; all credit balances except <strong>CPUSurplusCreditsCharged</strong> remain and are carried over. Because T2 Unlimited instances have the ability to burst at any time, they do not receive the 30 minutes of credits given to newly launched T2 Standard instances. Also, since each AWS account can launch a limited number of T2 Standard instances with initial CPU credits each day, T2 Unlimited instances can be a better fit for use in Auto Scaling Groups and other scenarios where large numbers of instances come and go each day.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/">AWS Systems Manager</a> is a new way to manage your cloud and hybrid IT environments. AWS Systems Manager provides a unified user interface that simplifies resource and application management, shortens the time to detect and resolve operational problems, and makes it easy to operate and manage your infrastructure securely at scale. This service is absolutely packed full of features. It defines a new experience around grouping, visualizing, and reacting to problems using features from products like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/systems-manager/" title="Systems Manager">Amazon EC2 Systems Manager (SSM)</a> to enable rich operations across your resources.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/29/console_first_shot.png" /></p> 
<p>As I said above, there are a lot of powerful features in this service and we won’t be able to dive deep on all of them but it’s easy to go to the console and get started with any of the tools.</p> 
<b>Resource Groupings</b> 
<p>Resource Groups allow you to create logical groupings of most resources that support tagging like: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" title="">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</a> instances, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a> buckets, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing" title="">Elastic Load Balancing</a> balancers, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" title="">Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)</a> instances, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/" title="">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/" title="">Amazon Kinesis</a> streams, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/" title="">Amazon Route 53</a> zones, and more. Previously, you could use the AWS Console to define resource groupings but AWS Systems Manager provides this new resource group experience via a new console and API. These groupings are a fundamental building block of Systems Manager in that they are frequently the target of various operations you may want to perform like: compliance management, software inventories, patching, and other automations.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/26/resource_groups.png" /></p> 
<p>You start by defining a group based on tag filters. From there you can view all of the resources in a centralized console. You would typically use these groupings to differentiate between applications, application layers, and environments like production or dev – but you can make your own rules about how to use them as well. If you imagine a typical 3 tier web-app you might have a few EC2 instances, an ELB, a few S3 buckets, and an RDS instance. You can define a grouping for that application and with all of those different resources simultaneously.</p> 
<b>Insights</b> 
<p>AWS Systems Manager automatically aggregates and displays operational data for each resource group through a dashboard. You no longer need to navigate through multiple AWS consoles to view all of your operational data. You can easily integrate your exiting <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" title="">Amazon CloudWatch</a> dashboards, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/config/" title="">AWS Config</a> rules, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/" title="">AWS CloudTrail</a> trails, AWS Trusted Advisor notifications, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/phd/" title="">AWS Personal Health Dashboard</a> performance and availability alerts. You can also easily view your software inventories across your fleet. AWS Systems Manager also provides a compliance dashboard allowing you to see the state of various security controls and patching operations across your fleets.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/26/inventory_1.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/26/compliance_1.png" /></p> 
<b>Acting on Insights</b> 
<p>Building on the success of EC2 Systems Manager (SSM), AWS Systems Manager takes all of the features of SSM and provides a central place to access them. These are all the same experiences you would have through SSM with a more accesible console and centralized interface. You can use the resource groups you’ve defined in Systems Manager to visualize and act on groups of resources.</p> 
<h3>Automation</h3> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/26/automation_1.png" /><br /> Automations allow you to define common IT tasks as a JSON document that specify a list of tasks. You can also use community published documents. These documents can be executed through the Console, CLIs, SDKs, scheduled maintenance windows, or triggered based on changes in your infrastructure through CloudWatch events. You can track and log the execution of each step in the documents and prompt for additional approvals. It also allows you to incrementally roll out changes and automatically halt when errors occur. You can start executing an automation directly on a resource group and it will be able to apply itself to the resources that it understands within the group.</p> 
<h3>Run Command</h3> 
<p>Run Command is a superior alternative to enabling SSH on your instances. It provides safe, secure remote management of your instances at scale without logging into your servers, replacing the need for SSH bastions or remote powershell. It has granular IAM permissions that allow you to restrict which roles or users can run&nbsp;certain&nbsp;commands.</p> 
<h3>Patch Manager, Maintenance Windows, and State Manager</h3> 
<p>I’ve written about <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ec2-systems-manager-patch-manager-now-supports-linux/">Patch Manager</a> before and if you manage fleets of Windows and Linux instances it’s a great way to maintain a common baseline of security across your fleet.</p> 
<p>Maintenance windows allow you to schedule instance maintenance and other disruptive tasks for a specific time window.</p> 
<p>State Manager allows you to control various server configuration details like anti-virus definitions, firewall settings, and more. You can define policies in the console or run existing scripts, PowerShell modules, or even Ansible playbooks directly from S3 or GitHub. You can query State Manager at any time to view the status of your instance configurations.</p> 
<b>Things To Know</b> 
<p>There’s some interesting terminology here. We haven’t done the best job of naming things in the past so let’s take a moment to clarify. EC2 Systems Manager (sometimes called SSM) is what you used before today. You can still invoke <code>aws ssm</code> commands. However, AWS Systems Manager builds on and enhances many of the tools provided by EC2 Systems Manager and allows those same tools to be applied to more than just EC2. When you see the phrase “Systems Manager” in the future you should think of AWS Systems Manager and not EC2 Systems Manager.</p> 
<p>AWS Systems Manager with all of this useful functionality is provided at no additional charge. It is immediately available in all public AWS regions.</p> 
<p>The best part about these services is that even with their tight integrations each one is designed to be used in isolation as well. If you only need one component of these services it’s simple to get started with only that component.</p> 
<p>There’s a lot more than I could ever document in this post so I encourage you all to jump into the&nbsp;<a href="https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fsystems-manager%2Fhome%3Fstate%3DhashArgs%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue&amp;client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A015428540659%3Auser%2Fssm&amp;forceMobileApp=0">console</a> and<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-systems-manager.html"> documentation</a> to figure out where you can start using AWS Systems Manager.</p>

<p>I was recently reading an article on ReadWrite.com titled “<a href="https://readwrite.com/2016/12/21/iot-devices-increase-200-worldwide-five-years-dl4/">IoT devices go forth and multiply, to increase 200% by 2021</a>“, and while the article noted the benefit for consumers and the industry of this growth, two things in the article stuck with me. The first was the specific statement that read “researchers warned that the proliferation of IoT technology will create a new bevvy of challenges. Particularly troublesome will be IoT deployments at scale for both end-users and providers.” Not only was that sentence a mouthful, but it really addressed some of the challenges that can come building solutions and deployment of this exciting new technology area. The second sentiment in the article that stayed with me was that Security issues could grow.</p> 
<p>So the article got me thinking, how can we create these cool IoT solutions using low-cost efficient microcontrollers with a secure operating system that can easily connect to the cloud. Luckily the answer came to me by way of an exciting new open-source based offering coming from AWS that I am happy to announce to you all today. Let’s all welcome, Amazon&nbsp;FreeRTOS to the technology stage.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/freertos/"><strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong></a> is an IoT microcontroller operating system that&nbsp;simplifies development, security, deployment, and maintenance of microcontroller-based edge devices. Amazon FreeRTOS extends the FreeRTOS kernel, a popular real-time operating system, with libraries that enable local and cloud connectivity, security, and (coming soon) over-the-air updates.</p> 
<p>So what are some of the great benefits of this new exciting offering, you ask. They are as follows:</p> 
<li><strong>Easily to create solutions for Low Power Connected Devices</strong>: provides a common operating system (OS) and libraries that make the development of common IoT capabilities easy for devices. For example; over-the-air (OTA) updates&nbsp;<em>(coming soon)</em> and&nbsp;device configuration.</li> 
<li><strong>Secure Data and Device Connections:&nbsp;</strong>devices only run trusted software using the Code Signing service, Amazon FreeRTOS provides a secure connection to the AWS using TLS, as well as, the ability to securely store keys and sensitive data on the device.</li> 
<li><strong>Extensive Ecosystem:&nbsp;</strong>contains an&nbsp;extensive hardware and technology ecosystem that allows you to choose a variety of qualified chipsets, including Texas Instruments, Microchip, NXP Semiconductors, and STMicroelectronics.</li> 
<li><strong>Cloud or Local Connections:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Devices can connect directly to the AWS Cloud or via <strong>AWS Greengrass</strong>.</li> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span style="color: #3366ff"><strong>What’s cool is that it is easy to get started.</strong>&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p>The <strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong> console allows you to select and download the software that you need for your solution.</p> 
<p>There is a Qualification Program that helps to assure you that the microcontroller you choose will run consistently across several hardware options.</p> 
<p>Finally, <strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong> kernel is an open-source FreeRTOS operating system that is freely available on GitHub for download.</p> 
<p>But I couldn’t leave you without at least showing you a few snapshots of the <strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong> Console.</p> 
<p>Within the <strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong> Console, I can select a predefined software configuration that I would like to use.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AmazonFreeRTOS-02-NewSoftwareConfig1.png" /></p> 
<p>If I want to have a more customized software configuration, <strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong> allows you to customize a solution that is targeted for your use by adding or removing libraries.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AmazonFreeRTOS-01-NewSoftwareConfig.png" /></p> 
<p><strong><u>Summary</u></strong></p> 
<p>Thanks for checking out the new <strong>Amazon FreeRTOS&nbsp;</strong>offering. To learn more go to the&nbsp;<strong>Amazon FreeRTOS</strong> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/freertos/">product page</a> or review the information provided about this exciting IoT device targeted operating system in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/freertos/">AWS documentation</a>.</p>

<p>One of the technology areas I thoroughly enjoy is the Internet of Things (IoT). Even as a child I used to infuriate my parents by taking apart the toys they would purchase for me to see how they worked and if I could somehow put them back together. It seems somehow I was destined to end up the tough and ever-changing world of technology. Therefore, it’s no wonder that I am really enjoying learning and tinkering with IoT devices and technologies. It combines my love of development and software engineering with my curiosity around circuits, controllers, and other facets of the electrical engineering discipline; even though an electrical engineer I can not claim to be.</p> 
<p>Despite all of the information that is collected by the deployment of IoT devices and solutions, I honestly never really thought about the need to analyze, search, and process this data <strong>until</strong> I came up against a scenario where it became of the utmost importance to be able to search and query through loads of sensory data for an anomaly occurrence. Of course, I understood the importance of analytics for businesses to make accurate decisions and predictions to drive the organization’s direction. But it didn’t occur to me initially, how important it was to make analytics an integral part of my IoT solutions. Well, I learned my lesson just in time because this re:Invent a service is launching to make it easier for anyone to process and analyze IoT messages and device data.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Hello, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-analytics/"><strong>AWS IoT Analytics</strong></a>! &nbsp;<strong>AWS IoT Analytics</strong> is a fully managed service of <strong>AWS IoT</strong> that provides advanced data analysis of data collected from your IoT devices.&nbsp; With the <strong>AWS IoT Analytics</strong> service, you can process messages, gather and store large amounts of device data, as well as, query your data. Also, the new <strong>AWS IoT</strong> <strong>Analytics</strong> service feature integrates with <strong>Amazon Quicksight</strong> for visualization of your data and brings the power of machine learning through integration with <strong>Jupyter Notebooks</strong>.</p> 
<p><strong>Benefits of AWS IoT Analytics</strong></p> 
<li>Helps with predictive analysis of data by providing access to pre-built analytical functions</li> 
<li>Provides ability to visualize analytical output from service</li> 
<li>Provides tools to clean up data</li> 
<li>Can help identify patterns in the gathered data</li> 
<p><strong>Be In the Know: IoT Analytics Concepts </strong></p> 
<li><strong>Channel</strong>: archives the raw, unprocessed messages and collects data from MQTT topics.</li> 
<li><strong>Pipeline</strong>: consumes messages from channels and allows message processing. 
<li><em><strong>Activities</strong></em>: perform transformations on your messages including filtering attributes and invoking lambda functions advanced processing.</li> 
</ul> </li> 
<li><strong>Data Store</strong>: Used as a queryable repository for processed messages. Provide ability to have multiple datastores for messages coming from different devices or locations or filtered by message attributes.</li> 
<li><strong>Data Set</strong>: Data retrieval view from a data store, can be generated by a recurring schedule.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li> 
<p><strong>Getting Started with AWS IoT Analytics</strong></p> 
<p>First, I’ll create a channel to receive incoming messages.&nbsp; This channel can be used to ingest data sent to the channel via MQTT or messages directed from the Rules Engine. To create a channel, I’ll select the <strong>Channels</strong> menu option and then click the <strong>Create a channel</strong> button.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-01-CreateChannel.png" /></p> 
<p>I’ll name my channel, <strong>TaraIoTAnalyticsID</strong> and give the <strong>Channel</strong> a <strong>MQTT topic filter</strong> of <strong>Temperature</strong>. To complete the creation of my channel, I will click the <strong>Create Channel</strong> button.<img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-02-ChannelID.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-03-ChannelCreated.png" /></p> 
<p>Now that I have my <strong>Channel</strong> created, I need to create a <strong>Data Store</strong> to receive and store the messages received on the <strong>Channel</strong> from my IoT device. Remember you can set up multiple Data Stores for more complex solution needs, but I’ll just create one <strong>Data Store</strong> for my example. I’ll select <strong>Data Stores</strong> from menu panel and click <strong>Create a data store</strong>.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-04-CreateDatasource.png" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>I’ll name my <strong>Data Store</strong>, <strong>TaraDataStoreID</strong>, and once I click the <strong>Create the data store</strong> button and I would have successfully set up a <strong>Data Store</strong> to house messages coming from my <strong>Channel</strong>.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-06-DatasourceCreated.png" /></p> 
<p>Now that I have my <strong>Channel</strong> and my <strong>Data Store</strong>, I will need to connect the two using a <strong>Pipeline</strong>. I’ll create a simple pipeline that just connects my Channel and Data Store, but you can create a more robust pipeline to process and filter messages by adding Pipeline activities like a <strong>Lambda activity</strong>.</p> 
<p>To create a pipeline, I’ll select the <strong>Pipelines</strong> menu option and then click the <strong>Create a pipeline</strong> button.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-07-CreatePipeline.png" /></p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-08-PipelineID.png" /></p> 
<p>I will not add an <strong>Attribute</strong> for this pipeline. So I will click <strong>Next&nbsp;</strong>button.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-09-Attributes.png" /></p> 
<p>As we discussed there are additional pipeline activities that I can add to my pipeline for the processing and transformation of messages but I will keep my first pipeline simple and hit the <strong>Next</strong> button.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/IoT Analytics-10-Activities.png" /></p> 
<p>The final step in creating my pipeline is for me to select my previously created <strong>Data Store</strong> and click <strong>Create Pipeline</strong>.</p>

<p>All that is left for me to take advantage of the <strong>AWS IoT Analytics</strong> service is to create an IoT rule that sends data to an AWS IoT Analytics channel.&nbsp; Wow, that was a super easy process to set up analytics for IoT devices.</p> 
<p>If I wanted to create a <strong>Data Set</strong> as a result of queries run against my data for visualization with <strong>Amazon Quicksight</strong> or integrate with <strong>Jupyter Notebooks </strong>to&nbsp;perform more advanced analytical functions, I can choose the <strong>Analyze</strong> menu option to bring up the screens to create data sets and access the <strong>Juypter Notebook</strong> instances.</p>

<p><strong><u>Summary</u></strong></p> 
<p>As you can see, it was a very simple process to set up the advanced data analysis for AWS IoT. With AWS IoT Analytics, you have the ability to collect, visualize, process, query and store large amounts of data generated from your AWS IoT connected device. Additionally, you can access the AWS IoT Analytics service in a myriad of different ways; the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the AWS IoT API, language-specific AWS SDKs, and AWS IoT Device SDKs.</p> 
<p>AWS IoT Analytics is available today for you to dig into the analysis of your IoT data. To learn more about AWS IoT and AWS IoT Analytics go to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-analytics/">AWS IoT Analytics product page</a> and/or the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/iot/">AWS IoT documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Scale takes on a whole new meaning when it comes to IoT. Last year I was lucky enough to tour a gigantic factory that had, on average, one environment sensor per square meter. The sensors measured temperature, humidity, and air purity several times per second, and served as an early warning system for contaminants. I’ve heard customers express interest in deploying IoT-enabled consumer devices in the millions or tens of millions.</p> 
<p>With powerful, long-lived devices deployed in a geographically distributed fashion, managing security challenges is crucial. However, the limited amount of local compute power and memory can sometimes limit the ability to use encryption and other forms of data protection.</p> 
<p>To address these challenges and to allow our customers to confidently deploy IoT devices at scale, we are working on <span title="">IoT Device Defender</span>. While the details might change before release, <span title="">AWS IoT Device Defender</span> is designed to offer these benefits:</p> 
<p><strong>Continuous Auditing</strong> – <span title="">AWS IoT Device Defender</span> monitors the policies related to your devices to ensure that the desired security settings are in place. It looks for drifts away from best practices and supports custom audit rules so that you can check for conditions that are specific to your deployment. For example, you could check to see if a compromised device has subscribed to sensor data from another device. You can run audits on a schedule or on an as-needed basis.</p> 
<p><strong>Real-Time Detection and Alerting</strong> – <span title="">AWS IoT Device Defender</span> looks for and quickly alerts you to unusual behavior that could be coming from a compromised device. It does this by monitoring the behavior of similar devices over time, looking for unauthorized access attempts, changes in connection patterns, and changes in traffic patterns (either inbound or outbound).</p> 
<p><strong>Fast Investigation and Mitigation</strong> – In the event that you get an alert that something unusual is happening, <span title="">AWS IoT Device Defender</span> gives you the tools, including contextual information, to help you to investigate and mitigate the problem. Device information, device statistics, diagnostic logs, and previous alerts are all at your fingertips. You have the option to reboot the device, revoke its permissions, reset it to factory defaults, or push a security fix.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Stay Tuned</strong></span><br /> I’ll have more info (and a hands-on post) as soon as possible, so stay tuned!</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot" title="">AWS IoT</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass" title="">AWS Greengrass</a> give you a solid foundation and programming environment for your IoT devices and applications.</p> 
<p>The nature of IoT means that an at-scale device deployment often encompasses millions or even tens of millions of devices deployed at hundreds or thousands of locations. At that scale, treating each device individually is impossible. You need to be able to set up, monitor, update, and eventually retire devices in bulk, collective fashion while also retaining the flexibility to accommodate varying deployment configurations, device models, and so forth.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New AWS IoT Device Management</strong></span><br /> Today we are launching <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-device-management/"><span title="">AWS IoT Device Management</span></a> to help address this challenge. It will help you through each phase of the device lifecycle, from manufacturing to retirement. Here’s what you get:</p> 
<p><strong>Onboarding</strong> – Starting with devices in their as-manufactured state, you can control the provisioning workflow. You can use IoT Device Management templates to quickly onboard entire fleets of devices with a few clicks. The templates can include information about device certificates and access policies.</p> 
<p><strong>Organization</strong> – In order to deal with massive numbers of devices, <span title="">AWS IoT Device Management</span> extends the existing IoT Device Registry and allows you to create a hierarchical model of your fleet and to set policies on a hierarchical basis. You can drill-down through the hierarchy in order to locate individual devices. You can also query your fleet on attributes such as device type or firmware version.</p> 
<p><strong>Monitoring</strong> – Telemetry from the devices is used to gather real-time connection, authentication, and status metrics, which are published to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" title="">Amazon CloudWatch</a>. You can examine the metrics and locate outliers for further investigation. IoT Device Management lets you configure the log level for each device group, and you can also publish change events for the Registry and Jobs for monitoring purposes.</p> 
<p><strong>Remote Management</strong> – <span title="">AWS IoT Device Management</span> lets you remotely manage your devices. You can push new software and firmware to them, reset to factory defaults, reboot, and set up bulk updates at the desired velocity.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Exploring AWS IoT Device Management</strong></span><br /> The <span title="">AWS IoT Device Management</span> Console took me on a tour and pointed out how to access each of the features of the service:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/iotdm_tour_1.jpg" /></p> 
<p>I already have a large set of devices (pressure gauges):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dm_gauges_1.jpg" /></p> 
<p>These gauges were created using the new template-driven bulk registration feature. Here’s how I create a template:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dm_create_template_1.jpg" /></p> 
<p>The gauges are organized into groups (by US state in this case):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dm_thing_groups_1.jpg" /></p> 
<p>Here are the gauges in Colorado:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dm_things_in_co_1.png" /></p> 
<p>AWS IoT group policies allow you to control access to specific IoT resources and actions for all members of a group. The policies are structured very much like IAM policies, and can be created in the console:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dm_make_policy_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Jobs are used to selectively update devices. Here’s how I create one:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dm_jobs_1.png" /></p> 
<p>As indicated by the <strong>Job type</strong> above, jobs can run either once or continuously. Here’s how I choose the devices to be updated:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dm_pick_your_ear_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I can create custom authorizers that make use of a Lambda function:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/dm_custom_auth_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I’ve shown you a medium-sized subset of <span title="">AWS IoT Device Management</span> in this post. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-device-management/">Check it out</a> for yourself to learn more!</p>

<p>Many years ago I was wandering through the <a href="https://www.lib.umd.edu/epsl">University of Maryland CS Library</a> and found a dusty old book titled <a href="https://archive.org/stream/whatcomputerscan017504mbp/whatcomputerscan017504mbp_djvu.txt">What Computers Can’t Do</a>, adjacent to its successor, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-Computers-Still-Cant-Artificial/dp/0262540673">What Computers Still Can’t Do</a>. The second book was thicker, which made me realize that Computer Science was a worthwhile field to study. While preparing to write this post I found an archive copy of the first book and found an interesting observation:</p> 
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Since a human being using and understanding a sentence in a natural language requires an implicit knowledge of the sentence’s context-dependent use, the only way to make a computer that could understand and translate a natural language may well be, as Turing suspected, to program it to learn about the world.</p> 
<p>This was a very prescient observation and I’d like to tell you about <span title="">Amazon Comprehend</span>, a new service that actually knows (and is very happy to share) quite a bit about the world!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Introducing Amazon Comprehend</strong></span><br /> <img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/comp_logo_2.png">Comprehend</span>‘s topic modeling service extracts topics from large sets of documents for analysis or topic-based grouping.</p> 
<p>The first four functions (language detection, entity categorization, sentiment analysis, and key phrase extraction) are designed for interactive use, with responses available in hundreds of milliseconds. Topic extraction works on a job-based model, with responses proportional to the size of the collection.</p> 
<p><span title="">Comprehend</span> is a continuously-trained trained Natural Language Processing (NLP) service. Our team of engineers and data scientists continue to extend and refine the training data, with the goal of making the service increasingly accurate and more broadly applicable over time.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Exploring Amazon Comprehend</strong></span><br /> You can explore <span title="">Amazon Comprehend</span> using the Console and then build applications that make use of the <span title="">Comprehend</span> APIs. I’ll use the opening paragraph from my <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-direct-connect-gateway-inter-region-vpc-access/">recent post</a> on Direct Connect to exercise the <span title="">Amazon Comprehend</span> API Explorer. I simply paste the text into the box and click on <strong>Analyze</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/di_analyze_text_2.png" /></p> 
<p><span title="">Comprehend</span> processes the text at lightning speed, highlights the entities that it identifies (as you can see above), and makes all of the other information available at a click:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/di_con_main_2.png" /></p> 
<p>Let’s look at each part of the results. <span title="">Comprehend</span> can detect many categories of entities in the text that I supply:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/di_ent_menu_2.png" /></p> 
<p>Here are all of the entities that were found in my text (they can also be displayed in list or raw JSON form):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/di_my_entities_vis_2.png" /></p> 
<p>Here are the first key phrases (the rest are available by clicking <strong>Show all</strong>):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/di_key_phrases_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Language and sentiment are simple and straightforward:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/di_ls_2.png" /></p> 
<p>Ok, so those are the interactive functions. Let’s take a look at the batch ones! I already have an S3 bucket that contains several thousand of my older blog posts, an empty one for my output, an IAM role that allows <span title="">Comprehend</span> to access both. I enter it and click on <strong>Create job</strong> to get started:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/di_create_topic_job_8.png" /></p> 
<p>I can see my recent jobs in the Console:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/di_jobs_4.png" /></p> 
<p>The output appears in my bucket when the job is complete:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/di_job_s3_output_2.png" /></p> 
<p>For demo purposes I can download the data and take a peek (in most cases I would feed it in to a visualization or analysis tool):</p> 
<code class="lang-bash">$ aws s3 ls s3://comp-out/348414629041-284ed5bdd23471b8539ed5db2e6ae1a7-1511638148578/output/

<p>With the advent of the internet, the world has become a much smaller place. Loads of information can be stored and transmitted between cultures and countries within a blink of an eye, giving us all the ability to learn and grow from each other. In order for us to take advantage of all of these powerful vehicles of knowledge and data transfer, we must first break through some of the language barriers that may prevent information sharing and communication.</p> 
<p>Outside of being multilingual, one of the ways we can break through these barriers is by leveraging machine translation and related technologies to translate between the languages. Machine translation technologies stem from the computational linguistics field of study that focuses on using software to translate text or speech from one language to another. The concept of machine translation dates back to 1949 when Warren Weaver, an American scientist and mathematician, created the Memorandum on Translation at the request of colleagues from the Division of Natural Sciences at the Rockefeller Foundation to share his language translation ideas. Since then, we have come a long way in the field of machine language translation by using neural networks to enhance the efficiency and quality of translation methods. It should, therefore, be no surprise that the field’s technical progression has led us to the exciting new service I want to introduce to you today.</p> 
<p><strong><u>Let’s Welcome: Amazon Translate</u></strong></p> 
<p>Join me in welcoming the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/translate/"><strong>Amazon Translate</strong></a> service to the Amazon Web Service family. <strong>Amazon Translate</strong> is a high-quality neural machine translation service that uses advanced machine learning technologies to provide fast language translation of text-based content and enable the development of applications that provide multilingual user experiences. The service is currently in preview and can be used to translate text to and from English and the supported languages.</p> 
<p>With the&nbsp;<strong>Translate</strong> service, organizations and business now have the ability to expand products and services in other regions more easily by allowing consumers to access websites, information, and resources in their preferred language using automated language translations. In addition, customers can engage in multiplayer chats, gather information from consumer forums, dive into educational documents, and even obtain reviews about hotels even if those resources are provided in a language they can’t readily understand.</p> 
<p>If you are like me, you may be curious about how <strong>Amazon Translate</strong> works to provide quality machine language translation. Based on deep learning technologies, Translate uses neural networks to represent models trained to translate between language pairs. The model consists of an encoder component which reads sentences from the source language and creates a representation that captures the meaning of the text provided. The model also has a decoder component that formulates a semantic representation used to generate a translation of the text from the source language to the target language. In addition, attention mechanisms are used by the service to build context from each word of the source text provided in order to decide which words are appropriate for generating the next target word. The concept of attention mechanisms in deep learning means that the neural network focuses on the relevant context of source inputs by taking into account the entire context of the source sentence, as well as everything it has generated previously. This process helps to create more accurate and fluent translations.</p> 
<p><strong>Amazon Translate</strong> can be used with other AWS services to build a robust multilingual experience or enable language-independent processing. For example, the Translate service can be used with some of the following services:</p> 
<li><strong>Amazon Polly:</strong> take translated text and provide lifelike speech and allow creation of applications that speak</li> 
<li><strong>Amazon S3: </strong>provides the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>ability to create translated document repositories</li> 
<li><strong>AWS Elasticsearch:</strong> create multi-language search using the managed Elasticsearch engine</li> 
<li><strong>Amazon Lex:</strong>&nbsp;build a translation chatbot using text and voice</li> 
<li><strong>AWS Lambda:</strong> enable localization of dynamic website content</li> 
<p>These are just a few examples, but there are many possible solutions that can be enabled by pairing <strong>Translate</strong> with other AWS Services. Let’s take a quick look at the console and try out the service preview.</p> 
<p>When I log into the console, I am presented with lots of great information. I can review&nbsp;information detailing how the&nbsp;<strong>Amazon</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Translate</strong> service works including examples, guidelines, and resources around the service and its API.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Amazon Translate-01-Console-1.png" /></p> 
<p>Since I am very excited to try out this new service, there is no time like the present. I’ll click <strong>Try Translate</strong> button and go into the API Explorer section of the service.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AmazonTranslate-02-APIExplorer-small.png" /></p> 
<p>Since I believe I’m already pretty fluent in English, I’ll switch the language pair to have the <strong>Source Language</strong> as French (fr) and the <strong>Target Language</strong> as English (en). I’ll take some verbiage from the French-based hotel’s website I stayed in while in Belgium working a couple of weeks ago.</p> 
<p>After pasting the French text from the website into the <strong>Translate</strong> service to translate it to English, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the translation was not only quick but accurate.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/AmazonTranslate-03-FRtoEN-translation-1.png" /></p> 
<p><strong><u>Summary</u></strong></p> 
<p>I am excited to have had the opportunity to provide to you all with an introduction of the new neural-machine translation service, <b>Amazon Translate</b>. With the service, you can translate text to and from English across the breadth of supported languages in real-time. The service is slated to be used directly via the AWS API, CLI, and/or supported SDKs.</p> 
<p>Sign up for the <strong>Amazon Translate</strong> <a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/amazon-translate-preview.html">preview</a> today and try the translation service. Learn more about the service by checking out the preview product page or reviewing the technical guides provided in the AWS documentation.</p>

<p>Today we’re launching a private <a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/amazon-transcribe-preview.html">preview</a> of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/">Amazon Transcribe</a>, an&nbsp;automatic speech recognition (ASR) service that makes it easy for developers to add speech to text capabilities to their applications. As bandwidth and connectivity improve, more and more of the world’s data is stored in video and audio formats. People are creating and consuming all of this data faster than ever before. It’s important for businesses to have some means of deriving value from all of that rich multimedia content. With Amazon Transcribe you can save on the costly process of manual transcription with an efficient and scalable API.</p> 
<p>You can analyze audio files stored on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a> in many common formats (WAV, MP3, Flac, etc.) by starting a job with the API. You’ll receive detailed and accurate transcriptions with timestamps for each word, as well as inferred punctuation. During the preview you can use the asynchronous transcription API to transcribe speech in English or Spanish.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/24/transcribe_console_1.png" /></p> 
<p>Companies are looking to derive value from both their existing catalogs and their incoming data. By transcribing these stored media, companies can:</p> 
<li>Analyze customer call data</li> 
<li>Automate subtitle creation</li> 
<li>Target advertising based on content</li> 
<li>Enable rich search capabilities on archives of audio and video content</li> 
<p>You can start a transcription job easily with the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/" title="">AWS SDKs</a>, or the Amazon Transcribe console.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/24/transcribe_console_2_border.png" /></p> 
<p>Amazon Transcribe currently has 3, mostly self-explanatory, API Actions:</p> 
<li>StartTranscriptionJob</li> 
<li>GetTranscriptionJob</li> 
<li>ListTranscriptionJobs</li> 
<p>Here’s a quick python script that starts a job and polls until the job is finished:</p> 
<code class="lang-python">from __future__ import print_function
import time
import boto3
transcribe = boto3.client('transcribe')
job_name = &quot;RandallTest1&quot;
job_uri = &quot;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/randhunt-transcribe-demos/test.flac&quot;
transcribe.start_transcription_job(
TranscriptionJobName=job_name,
Media={'MediaFileUri': job_uri},
MediaFormat='flac',
LanguageCode='en-US',
MediaSampleRateHertz=44100
)
while True:
status = transcribe.get_transcription_job(TranscriptionJobName=job_name)
if status['TranscriptionJob']['TranscriptionJobStatus'] in ['COMPLETED', 'FAILED']:
break
print(&quot;Not ready yet...&quot;)
time.sleep(5)
print(status)
</code> 
<p>The result of a completed job links to an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a> presigned-url that contains our transcription in JSON format:</p> 
<code class="lang-json">{
&quot;jobName&quot;: &quot;RandallTest1&quot;,
&quot;results&quot;: {
&quot;transcripts&quot;: [{&quot;transcript&quot;: &quot;Hello World&quot;, &quot;confidence&quot;: 1}],
&quot;items&quot;: [
{
&quot;start_time&quot;: &quot;0.880&quot;, &quot;end_time&quot;: &quot;1.300&quot;,
&quot;alternatives&quot;: [{&quot;confidence&quot;: 0.91, &quot;word&quot;: &quot;Hello&quot;}]
},
{
&quot;start_time&quot;: &quot;1.400&quot;, &quot;end_time&quot;: &quot;1.620&quot;,
&quot;alternatives&quot;: [{&quot;confidence&quot;: 0.84, &quot;word&quot;: &quot;World&quot;}]
}
]
},
&quot;status&quot;: &quot;COMPLETED&quot;
}
</code> 
<p>As you can see you get timestamps and confidence scores for each word.</p> 
<p>Whether alone or combined with other Amazon AI services this is a powerful service and I can’t wait to see what our customers build with it! Sign up for the <a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/amazon-transcribe-preview.html">preview</a> today.</p>

<p>Cell phones, security cameras, baby monitors, drones, webcams, dashboard cameras, and even satellites can all generate high-intensity, high-quality video streams. Homes, offices, factories, cities, streets, and highways are now host to massive numbers of cameras. They survey properties after floods and other natural disasters, increase public safety, let you know that your child is safe and sound, capture one-off moments for endless “fail” videos (a personal favorite), collect data that helps to identify and solve traffic problems, and more.</p> 
<p>Dealing with this flood of video data can be challenging, to say the least. Incoming streams arrive unannounced, individually or by the millions. The stream contains valuable, real-time data that cannot be deferred, paused, or set aside to be dealt with at a more opportune time. Once you have the raw data, other challenges emerge. Storing, encrypting, and indexing the video data all come to mind. Extracting value—diving deep in to the content, understanding what’s there, and driving action—is the next big step.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Amazon Kinesis Video Streams</strong></span><br /> Today I would like to introduce you to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/"><span title="">Amazon Kinesis Video Streams</span></a>, the newest member of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/">Amazon Kinesis</a> family of real-time streaming services. You now have the power to ingest streaming video (or other time-encoded data) from millions of camera devices without having to set up or run your own infrastructure. <span title="">Kinesis Video Streams</span> accepts your incoming streams, stores them durably and in encrypted form, creates time-based indexes, and enables the creation of vision-enabled applications. You can process the incoming streams using Amazon Rekognition Video, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mxnet/" title="">MXNet</a>, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" title="">TensorFlow</a> OpenCV, or your own custom code, all in support of the the cool new robotics, analytics, and consumer apps that I know you will dream up.</p> 
<p>We manage all of the infrastructure for you. First, you use our Producer SDK (device-side) to create an app and then send us video from the device of your choice. The incoming video arrives over a secure TLS connection and is stored in time-indexed form, after being encrypted with a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kms/" title="">AWS Key Management Service (KMS)</a> key. Next, you use the Video Streams Parser Library (cloud-side) to consume the video stream and to extract value from it.</p> 
<p>Regardless of how much you send – low resolution or high, from one device or from millions – <span title="">Kinesis Video Streams</span>, will scale to meet your needs. You can, as I never get tired of saying, focus on your application and on your business. <span title="">Amazon Kinesis Video Streams</span> builds on parts of AWS that you already know. It stores video in S3 for cost-effective durability, uses <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/" title="">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> for access control, and is accessible from the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" title="">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</a>, and through a set of APIs.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Concepts</strong></span><br /> Let’s run through a couple of concepts and then set up a stream.</p> 
<p><strong>Producer</strong> – A producer is a data source that puts data into a stream. It could be a baby monitor, a video camera on a drone, or something more exotic: perhaps a temperature sensor or a satellite! The Amazon Kinesis Video Producer SDK provides a set of functions that make it easy to establish a connection and to stream video.</p> 
<p><strong>Stream</strong> – A stream allows you to transport live video data, optionally store it, and make it available for real-time or batch consumption. Streams can also carry other types of time-encoded data including audio, radar, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar">lidar</a>, and sensor readings. In most cases, there’s a 1-to-1 mapping between producers and streams. Multiple independent applications can consume and process data from a single stream.</p> 
<p><strong>Fragment &amp; Frames</strong> – A fragment is a time-bound set of individual frames from a stream.</p> 
<p><strong>Consumer</strong> – A consumer gets data (fragments or frames) from a stream and processes, analyzes, or displays it. Consumers can run in real-time or after the fact, and are built atop the Video Streams Parser Library.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Using Amazon Kinesis Video Streams</strong></span><br /> As I noted earlier, there’s a 1-to-1 mapping between producers and streams. In most cases, each instance of a producer will create a unique stream using the Kinesis Video Streams API. However, you can create streams manually for test or demo purposes, or if you need a small, fixed number of them.</p> 
<p>To create a stream manually, I open up the Kinesis Video Streams Console and click on <strong>Create Kinesis video stream</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/kvs_splash_1.png" /></p> 
<p>I simply enter the name of my stream and click on <strong>Create stream</strong>:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/kvs_create_easy_2.png" /></p> 
<p>I can uncheck <strong>Use default settings </strong>if I want to customize my stream (most of the settings can be changed later):</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/kvs_create_non_default_1.png" /></p> 
<p>My stream is ready for use immediately. The console will display video as soon as I start to stream it:</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/kvs_my_cheetah_stream_2.png" /></p> 
<p>The Kinesis team shared this screen with me; I did not have time to take a field trip. Does that make me a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetah">Cheetah</a>?</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Developing for Amazon Kinesis Video Streams</strong></span><br /> The next step is to use the Producer SDK to build the producer app. The app runs on the device or out in the field, and is responsible for creating a stream and then posting a stream of fragments (each typically represent 2 to 10 seconds of video) to the stream by making calls to the <code>PutMedia</code> function.</p> 
<p>The consumer side calls the <code>GetMedia</code> and <code>GetMediaFromFragmentList</code> functions to access content from the stream in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroska">Matroska</a> (MKV) container format, and uses the included Video Streams Parser Library to extract the desired content. <code>GetMedia</code> is intended to be used continuous streaming with very low latency; <code>GetMediaFromFragment</code> list is batch-oriented and allows selective processing.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Now Available</strong></span><br /> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/"><span title="">Amazon Kinesis Video Streams</span></a> is available in the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span>, <span title="">EU (Frankfurt)</span>, and <span title="">Asia Pacific (Tokyo)</span> Regions and you can start building your vision-enabled apps with it today.</p> 
<p>Pricing is based on three factors: amount of video produced, amount of video consumed, and amount of video stored.</p>
