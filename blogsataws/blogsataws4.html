<p>Earlier this month, my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/colmmacc">Colm MacC&aacute;rthaigh</a> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-privatelink-endpoints-kinesis-ec2-systems-manager-and-elb-apis-in-your-vpc/">told you about</a> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html#what-is-privatelink">AWS PrivateLink</a> and showed you how to use it to access AWS services such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/streams/" title="">Amazon Kinesis Streams</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/" title="">AWS Service Catalog</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/systems-manager/">EC2 Systems Manager</a>, the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">EC2 APIs</a>, and the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">ELB APIs</a> by way of VPC Endpoints. The endpoint (represented by one or more <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/elastic-network-adapter-high-performance-network-interface-for-amazon-ec2/">Elastic Network Interfaces</a> or ENIs) resides within your VPC and has IP addresses drawn from the VPC’s subnets, without the need for an Internet or NAT Gateway. This model is clear and easy to understand, not to mention secure and scalable!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Endpoints for Private Connectivity</strong></span><br /> Today we are building upon the initial launch and extending the PrivateLink model, allowing you to set up and use VPC Endpoints to access your own services and those made available by others. Even before we launched PrivateLink for AWS services, we had a lot of requests for this feature, so I expect it to be pretty popular. For example, one customer told us that they plan to create hundreds of VPCs, each hosting and providing a single microservice (read <a href="https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/microservices-on-aws.pdf">Microservices on AWS</a> to learn more).</p> 
<p>Companies can now create services and offer them for sale to other AWS customers, for access via a private connection. They create a service that accepts TCP traffic, host it behind a Network Load Balancer, and then make the service available, either directly or in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/" title="">AWS Marketplace</a>. They will be notified of new subscription requests and can choose to accept or reject each one. I expect that this feature will be used to create a strong, vibrant ecosystem of service providers in 2018.</p> 
<p>The service provider and the service consumer run in separate VPCs and AWS accounts and communicate solely through the endpoint, with all traffic flowing across Amazon’s private network. Service consumers don’t have to worry about overlapping IP addresses, arrange for VPC peering, or use a VPC Gateway. You can also use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/" title="">AWS Direct Connect</a> to connect your existing data center to one of your VPCs in order to allow your cloud-based applications to access services running on-premises, or vice versa.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Providing and Consuming Services</strong></span><br /> This new feature puts a lot of power at your fingertips. You can set it all up using the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">VPC APIs</a>, the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/index.html#cli-aws-ec2">VPC CLI</a>, or the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com" title="">AWS Management Console</a>. I’ll use the console, and will show you how to provide and then consume a service. I am going to do both within a single AWS account, but that’s just for demo purposes.</p> 
<p>Let’s talk about providing a service. It must run behind a Network Load Balancer and must be accessible over TCP. It can be hosted on EC2 instances, ECS containers, or on-premises (configured as an IP target), and should be able to scale in order to meet the expected level of demand. For low latency and fault tolerance, we recommend using an NLB with targets in every AZ of its region. Here’s mine:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_lb_targets_1.png" width="798" height="500" /></p> 
<p>I open up the VPC Console and navigate to <strong>Endpoint Services</strong>, then click on <strong>Create Endpoint Service</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_dash_create_1.png" width="810" height="456" /></p> 
<p>I choose my NLB (just one in this case, but I can choose two or more and they will be mapped to consumers on a round-robin basis). By clicking on <strong>Acceptance required</strong>, I get to control access to my endpoint on a request-by-request basis:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_create_ep_svc_1.png" width="900" height="551" /></p> 
<p>I click on <strong>Create service</strong> and my service is ready immediately:</p>

<p>If I was going to make this service available in <span title="">AWS Marketplace</span>, I would go ahead and create a listing now. Since I am going to be the producer and the consumer in this blog post, I’ll skip that step. I will, however, copy the <strong>Service name</strong> for use in the next step.</p> 
<p>I return to the VPC Dashboard and navigate to Endpoints, then click on <strong>Create endpoint</strong>. Then I select <strong>Find service by name</strong>, paste the service name, and click on <strong>Verify </strong>to move ahead. Then I select the desired AZs, and a subnet in each one, pick my security groups, and click on <strong>Create endpoint</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_create_my_ep_client_1.png" width="900" height="799" /></p> 
<p>Because I checked Acceptance required when I created the endpoint service, the connection is pending acceptance:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_con_pending_1.png" width="810" height="186" /></p> 
<p>Back on the endpoint service side (typically in a separate AWS account), I can see and accept the pending request:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_accept_1.png" width="810" height="317" /></p> 
<p>The endpoint becomes available and ready to use within a minute or so. If I was creating a service and selling access on a paid basis, I would accept the request as part of a larger, and perhaps automated, onboarding workflow for a new customer.</p> 
<p>On the consumer side, my new endpoint is accessible via DNS name:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/ep_dns_1.png" width="810" height="426" /></p> 
<p>Services provided by AWS and services in <span title="">AWS Marketplace</span> are accessible through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-horizon_DNS">split-horizon</a> DNS. Accessing the service through this name will resolve to the “best” endpoint, taking Region and Availability Zone into consideration.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>In the Marketplace</strong></span><br /> As I noted earlier, this new PrivateLink feature creates an opportunity for new and existing sellers in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/" title="">AWS Marketplace</a>. The following SaaS offerings are already available as endpoints and I expect many more to follow (read <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/tour/?ref=mkt_ste_catgtm_saashome&amp;refid=_TWITTER">Sell on AWS Marketplace</a> to get started):</p>

<p>Do you remember what web video was like in the early days? Standalone players, video no larger than a postage stamp, slow &amp; cantankerous connections, overloaded servers, and the ever-present <strong>buffering</strong> messages were the norm less than two decades ago.</p> 
<p>Today, thanks to technological progress and a broad array of standards, things are a lot better. Video consumers are now in control. They use devices of all shapes, sizes, and vintages to enjoy live and recorded content that is broadcast, streamed, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-top_media_services">sent over-the-top</a> (OTT, as they say), and expect immediate access to content that captures and then holds their attention. Meeting these expectations presents a challenge for content creators and distributors. Instead of generating video in a one-size-fits-all format, they (or their media servers) must be prepared to produce video that spans a broad range of sizes, formats, and bit rates, taking care to be ready to deal with planned or unplanned surges in demand. In the face of all of this complexity, they must backstop their content with a monetization model that supports the content and the infrastructure to deliver it.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New AWS Media Services</strong></span><br /> Today we are launching an array of broadcast-quality media services, each designed to address one or more aspects of the challenge that I outlined above. You can use them together to build a complete end-to-end video solution or you can use one or more in building-block style. In true AWS fashion, you can spend more time innovating and less time setting up and running infrastructure, leaving you ready to focus on creating, delivering, and monetizing your content. The services are all elastic, allowing you to ramp up processing power, connections, and storage and giving you the ability to handle million-user (and beyond) spikes with ease.</p> 
<p>Here are the services (all accessible from a set of interactive consoles as well as through a comprehensive set of APIs):</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaConvert</strong></a> – File-based transcoding for OTT, broadcast, or archiving, with support for a long list of formats and codecs. Features include multi-channel audio, graphic overlays, closed captioning, and several DRM options.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/medialive/"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaLive</strong></a> – Live encoding to deliver video streams in real time to both televisions and multiscreen devices. Allows you to deploy highly reliable live channels in minutes, with full control over encoding parameters. It supports ad insertion, multi-channel audio, graphic overlays, and closed captioning.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mediapackage/"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaPackage</strong></a> – Video origination and just-in-time packaging. Starting from a single input, produces output for multiple devices representing a long list of current and legacy formats. Supports multiple monetization models, time-shifted live streaming, ad insertion, DRM, and blackout management.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mediastore/"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaStore</strong></a> – Media-optimized storage that enables high performance and low latency applications such as live streaming, while taking advantage of the scale and durability of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a>.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaTailor</strong></a> – Monetization service that supports ad serving and server-side ad insertion, a broad range of devices, transcoding, and accurate reporting of server-side and client-side ad insertion.</p> 
<p>Instead of listing out all of the features in the sections below, I’ve simply included as many screen shots as possible with the expectation that this will give you a better sense of the rich set of features, parameters, and settings that you get with this set of services.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaConvert</strong></span><br /> MediaConvert allows you to transcode content that is stored in files. You can process individual files or entire media libraries, or anything in-between. You simply create a conversion job that specifies the content and the desired outputs, and submit it to MediaConvert. There’s no software to install or patch and the service scales to meet your needs without affecting turnaround time or performance.</p> 
<p>The MediaConvert Console lets you manage Output presets, Job templates, Queues, and Jobs:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_parts_1.png" width="318" height="342" /></p> 
<p>You can use a built-in system preset or you can make one of your own. You have full control over the settings when you make your own:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_preset_1.png" width="710" height="1215" /></p> 
<p>Jobs templates are named, and produce one or more output groups. You can add a new group to a template with a click:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emcs_add_job_output_group_1.png" width="620" height="331" /></p> 
<p>When everything is ready to go, you create a job and make some final selections, then click on <strong>Create</strong>:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_create_job_1.png" width="810" height="1007" /></p> 
<p>Each account starts with a default queue for jobs, where incoming work is processed in parallel using all processing resources available to the account. Adding queues does not add processing resources, but does cause them to be apportioned across queues. You can temporarily pause one queue in order to devote more resources to the others. You can submit jobs to paused queues and you can also cancel any that have yet to start.</p> 
<p>Pricing for this service is based on the amount of video that you process and the features that you use.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaLive</strong></span><br /> This service is for live encoding, and can be run 24&times;7. MediaLive channels are deployed on redundant resources distributed in two physically separated Availability Zones in order to provide the reliability expected by our customers in the broadcast industry. You can specify your inputs and define your channels in the MediaLive Console:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_create_ml_input_1.png" /></p> 
<p>After you create an Input, you create a Channel and attach it to the Input:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_create_live_channel_1.png" width="810" height="633" /></p> 
<p>You have full control over the settings for each channel:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_live_channel_settings_1.png" width="560" height="910" /></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaPackage</strong></span><br /> This service lets you deliver video to many devices from a single source. It focuses on protection and just-in-time packaging, giving you the ability to provide your users with the desired content on the device of their choice. You simply create a channel to get started:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_pack_make_channel_1.png" width="810" height="429" /></p> 
<p>Then you add one or more endpoints. Once again, plenty of options and full control, including a startover window and a time delay:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_pack_endpoints_1.png" width="760" height="1086" /></p> 
<p>You find the input URL, user name, and password for your channel and route your live video stream to it for packaging:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_pack_channel_info_1.png" width="860" height="338" /></p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaStore</strong></span><br /> MediaStore offers the performance, consistency, and latency required for live and on-demand media delivery. Objects are written and read into a new “temporal” tier of object storage for a limited amount of time, then move silently into <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">S3</a> for long-lived durability. You simply create a storage container to group your media content:</p> 
<p><img class="size-medium aligncenter" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_store_create_container_1.png" width="454" height="343" /></p> 
<p>The container is available within a minute or so:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_store_containers_1.png" width="810" height="298" /></p> 
<p>Like S3 buckets, MediaStore containers have access policies and no limits on the number of objects or storage capacity.</p> 
<p>MediaStore helps you to take full advantage of S3 by managing the object key names so as to maximize storage and retrieval throughput, in accord with the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/request-rate-perf-considerations.html">Request Rate and Performance Considerations</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>AWS Elemental MediaTailor</strong></span><br /> This service takes care of server-side ad insertion while providing a broadcast-quality viewer experience by transcoding ad assets on the fly. Your customer’s video player asks MediaTailor for a playlist. MediaTailor, in turn, calls your Ad Decision Server and returns a playlist that references the origin server for your original video and the ads recommended by the Ad Decision Server. The video player makes all of its requests to a single endpoint in order to ensure that client-side ad-blocking is ineffective. You simply create a MediaTailor Configuration:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/emc_tailor_config_1.png" width="760" height="846" /></p> 
<p>Context information is passed to the Ad Decision Server in the URL:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/wmc_ads_params_1.png" width="683" height="377" /></p> 
<p>Despite the length of this post I have barely scratched the surface of the AWS Media Services. Once <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a> is in the rear view mirror I hope to do a deep dive and show you how to use each of these services.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Available Now</strong></span><br /> The entire set of AWS Media Services is available now and you can start using them today! Pricing varies by service, but is built around a pay-as-you-go model.</p>

<p>If you have had an opportunity to read any of my blog posts or attended any session I’ve conducted at various conferences, you are probably aware that I am definitively a geek girl. I am absolutely enamored with all of the latest advancements that have been made in technology areas like cloud, artificial intelligence, internet of things and the maker space, as well as, with virtual reality and augmented reality. In my opinion, it is a wonderful time to be a geek. All the things that we dreamed about building while we sweated through our algorithms and discrete mathematics classes or the technology we marveled at when watching Star Wars and Star Trek are now coming to fruition. &nbsp;So hopefully this means it will only be a matter of time before I can hyperdrive to other galaxies in space, but until then I can at least build the 3D virtual reality and augmented reality characters and images like those featured in some of my favorite shows.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Sumerian-01-HeaderPic.png" width="845" height="176" /></p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sumerian/"><strong>Amazon Sumerian</strong></a> provides tools and resources that allows anyone to create and run augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and 3D applications with ease. &nbsp;With Sumerian, you can build multi-platform experiences that run on hardware like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus/pages/14586587011">Oculus</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HTC-VIVE-Virtual-Reality-System-pc/dp/B00VF5NT4I/">HTC Vive</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=node%3D7072561011&amp;field-keywords=apple">iOS devices </a>using WebVR compatible browsers and with support for ARCore on Android devices coming soon.</p> 
<p>This exciting new service, currently in preview, delivers features to allow you to design highly immersive and interactive 3D experiences from your browser. Some of these features are:</p> 
<li><strong>Editor:</strong> A web-based editor for constructing 3D scenes, importing assets, scripting interactions and special effects, with cross-platform publishing.</li> 
<li><strong>Object Library</strong>: a library of pre-built objects and templates.</li> 
<li><strong>Asset Import:</strong> Upload 3D assets to use in your scene. Sumerian supports importing FBX, OBJ, and coming soon Unity projects.</li> 
<li><strong>Scripting Library</strong>: provides a JavaScript scripting library via its 3D engine for advanced scripting capabilities.</li> 
<li><strong>Hosts</strong>: animated, lifelike 3D characters that can be customized for gender, voice, and language.</li> 
<li><strong>AWS Services Integration</strong>: baked in integration with Amazon Polly and Amazon Lex to add speech and natural language to into Sumerian hosts. Additionally, the scripting library can be used with AWS Lambda allowing use of the full range of AWS services.</li> 
<p>Since <strong>Amazon Sumerian</strong> doesn’t require you to have 3D graphics or programming experience to build rich, interactive VR and AR scenes, let’s take a quick run to the Sumerian Dashboard and check it out.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Sumerian-02-Dashboard-1.png" width="850" height="487" /></p> 
<p>From the Sumerian Dashboard, I can easily create a new scene with a push of a button.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Sumerian-03-CreateScene.png" width="850" height="469" /></p> 
<p>A default view of the new scene opens and is displayed in the Sumerian Editor. With the <strong>Tara Blog Scene</strong> opened in the editor, I can easily import assets into my scene.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Sumerian-04-Editor-1.png" width="850" height="471" /></p> 
<p>I’ll click the <strong>Import Asset</strong> button and pick an asset, View Room, to import into the scene. With the desired asset selected, I’ll click the <strong>Add</strong> button to import it.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Sumerian-05-ImportAsset-1.png" width="850" height="466" /></p> 
<p>Excellent, my asset was successfully imported into the Sumerian Editor and is shown in the Asset panel.&nbsp; Now, I have the option to add the View Room object into my scene by selecting it in the Asset panel and then dragging it onto the editor’s canvas.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Sumerian-05-ImportAsset-2.png" width="850" height="771" /></p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Sumerian-06-ViewRoomScene-1.png" width="850" height="474" /></p> 
<p>I’ll repeat the import asset process and this time I will add the Mannequin asset to the scene.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/Sumerian-07-MannequinAsset-1.png" width="850" height="477" /></p> 
<p>Additionally, with Sumerian, I can add scripting to Entity assets to make my scene even more exciting by adding a ScriptComponent to an entity and creating a script.&nbsp; I can use the provided built-in scripts or create my own custom scripts. If I create a new custom script, I will get a blank script with some base JavaScript code that looks similar to the code below.</p> 
<pre><code class="lang-js">'use strict';
/* global sumerian */
//This is Me-- trying out the custom scripts - Tara
var setup = function (args, ctx) {
// Called when play mode starts.
};
var fixedUpdate = function (args, ctx) {
// Called on every physics update, after setup().
};
var update = function (args, ctx) {
// Called on every render frame, after setup().
};
var lateUpdate = function (args, ctx) {
// Called after all script &quot;update&quot; methods in the scene has been called.
};
var cleanup = function (args, ctx) {
// Called when play mode stops.
};
var parameters = [];</code></pre> 
<p>Very cool, I just created a 3D scene using <strong>Amazon Sumerian</strong> in a matter of minutes and I have only scratched the surface.</p> 
<p><strong><u>Summary</u></strong></p> 
<p>The <strong>Amazon Sumerian</strong> service enables you to create, build, and run virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and 3D applications with ease.&nbsp; You don’t need any 3D graphics or specialized programming knowledge to get started building scenes and immersive experiences. &nbsp;You can import FBX, OBJ, and Unity projects in Sumerian, as well as upload your own 3D assets for use in your scene. In addition, you can create digital characters to narrate your scene and with these digital assets, you have choices for the character’s appearance, speech and behavior.</p> 
<p>You can <a href="https://docs.sumerian.amazonaws.com/tutorials/create/beginner/state-machine-basics/">learn more</a> about <strong>Amazon Sumerian</strong> and <a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/amazon-sumerian-preview.html">sign up for the preview</a> to get started with the new service on the product page.&nbsp; I can’t wait to see what rich experiences you all will build.</p>

<p><img style="float: right;border: 1px solid black;margin-left: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/in_welcome_re_1.jpg" />As you wander through the <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/" title="">AWS re:Invent</a> campus, take a minute to think about your expectations for all of the elements that need to come together…</p> 
<p>Starting with the location, my colleagues have chosen the best venues, designed the sessions, picked the speakers, laid out the menu, selected the color schemes, programmed or printed all of the signs, and much more, all with the goal of creating an optimal learning environment for you and tens of thousands of other AWS customers.</p> 
<p>However, as is often the case, the part that you can see is just a part of the picture. Behind the scenes, people, processes, plans, and systems come together to put all of this infrastructure in to place and to make it run so smoothly that you don’t usually notice it.</p> 
<p>Today I would like to tell you about a mission-critical aspect of the re:Invent infrastructure that is actually underground. In addition to providing great Wi-Fi for your phones, tablets, cameras, laptops, and other devices, we need to make sure that a myriad of events, from the live-streamed keynotes, to the WorkSpaces-powered hands-on labs, are well-connected to each other and to the Internet. With events running at hotels up and down the Las Vegas Strip, reliable, low-latency connectivity is essential!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Thank You CenturyLink / Level3</strong></span><br /> Over the years we have been working with the great folks at Level3 to make this happen. They recently became part of <a href="http://www.centurylink.com/">CenturyLink</a> and are now the Official Network Sponsor of re:Invent, responsible for the network fiber, circuits, and services that tie the re:Invent campus together.</p> 
<p>To make this happen, they set up two miles of dark fiber beneath the Strip, routed to multiple Availability Zones in two separate AWS Regions. The Sands Expo Center is equipped with redundant 10 gigabit connections and the other venues (Aria, MGM, Mirage, and Wynn) are each provisioned for 2 to 10 gigabits, meaning that over half of the Strip is enabled for Direct Connect. According to the IT manager at one of the facilities, this may be the largest temporary hybrid network ever configured in Las Vegas.</p> 
<p>On the Wi-Fi side, <a href="https://www.shownets.net/">showNets</a> is plugged in to the same network; your devices are talking directly to Direct Connect access points (how cool is that?).</p> 
<p>Here’s a simplified illustration of how it all fits together:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/show_network_1.png" width="890" height="452" /></p> 
<p>The CenturyLink team will be onsite at re:Invent and will be tweeting live network stats throughout the week.</p> 
<p>I hope you have enjoyed this quick look behind the scenes and beneath the street!</p>

<p>Our customers are using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot" title="">AWS IoT</a> to make their connected devices more intelligent. These devices collect &amp; measure data in the field (below the ground, in the air, in the water, on factory floors and in hospital rooms) and use <span title="">AWS IoT</span> as their gateway to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" title="">AWS Cloud</a>. Once connected to the cloud, customers can write device data to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" title="">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, process data using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/" title="">Amazon Kinesis</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" title="">AWS Lambda</a> functions, initiate <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns/" title="">Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)</a> push notifications, and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-rule-actions.html">much more</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Pricing Model (20-40% Reduction)</strong></span><br /> Today we are making a change to the <span title="">AWS IoT</span> pricing model that will make it an even better value for you. Most customers will see a price reduction of 20-40%, with some receiving a significantly larger discount depending on their workload.</p> 
<p>The original model was based on a charge for the number of messages that were sent to or from the service. This all-inclusive model was a good starting point, but also meant that some customers were effectively paying for parts of <span title="">AWS IoT</span> that they did not actually use. For example, some customers have devices that ping <span title="">AWS IoT</span> very frequently, with sparse rule sets that fire infrequently. Our new model is more fine-grained, with independent charges for each component (all prices are for devices that connect to the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span> Region):</p> 
<p><strong>Connectivity</strong> – Metered in 1 minute increments and based on the total time your devices are connected to <span title="">AWS IoT</span>. Priced at $0.08 per million minutes of connection (equivalent to $0.042 per device per year for 24/7 connectivity). Your devices can send keep-alive pings at 30 second to 20 minute intervals at no additional cost.</p> 
<p><strong>Messaging</strong> – Metered by the number of messages transmitted between your devices and <span title="">AWS IoT</span>. Pricing starts at $1 per million messages, with volume pricing falling as low as $0.70 per million. You may send and receive messages up to 128 kilobytes in size. Messages are metered in 5 kilobyte increments (up from 512 bytes previously). For example, an 8 kilobyte message is metered as two messages.</p> 
<p><strong>Rules Engine</strong> – Metered for each time a rule is triggered, and for the number of actions executed within a rule, with a minimum of one action per rule. Priced at $0.15 per million rules-triggered and $0.15 per million actions-executed. Rules that process a message in excess of 5 kilobytes are metered at the next multiple of the 5 kilobyte size. For example, a rule that processes an 8 kilobyte message is metered as two rules.</p> 
<p><strong>Device Shadow &amp; Registry Updates</strong> – Metered on the number of operations to access or modify Device Shadow or Registry data, priced at $1.25 per million operations. Device Shadow and Registry operations are metered in 1 kilobyte increments of the Device Shadow or Registry record size. For example, an update to a 1.5 kilobyte Shadow record is metered as two operations.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/" title="">AWS Free Tier</a> now offers a generous allocation of connection minutes, messages, triggered rules, rules actions, Shadow, and Registry usage, enough to operate a fleet of up to 50 devices. The new prices will take effect on January 1, 2018 with no effort on your part. At that time, the updated prices will be published on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-platform/pricing/">AWS IoT Pricing</a> page.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/p/feature/z6o9g6sysxur57t"><img style="border: 1px solid black;float: right;margin-left: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/bezos_muscle_man_3.jpeg" /></a>We launched the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/the-new-cost-explorer-for-aws/">AWS Cost Explorer</a> a couple of years ago in order to allow you to track, allocate, and manage your AWS costs. The response to that launch, and to additions that we have made since then, has been very positive. However our customers are, as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/p/feature/z6o9g6sysxur57t">Jeff Bezos has said</a>, “beautifully, wonderfully, dissatisfied.”</p> 
<p>I see this first-hand every day. We launch something and that launch inspires our customers to ask for even more. For example, with many customers going all-in and moving large parts of their IT infrastructure to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" title="">AWS Cloud</a>, we’ve had many requests for the raw data that feeds into the Cost Explorer. These customers want to programmatically explore their AWS costs, update ledgers and accounting systems with per-application and per-department costs, and to build high-level dashboards that summarize spending. Some of these customers have been going to the trouble of extracting the data from the charts and reports provided by Cost Explorer!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Cost Explorer API</strong></span><br /> Today we are making the underlying data that feeds into Cost Explorer available programmatically. The new Cost Explorer API gives you a set of functions that allow you do everything that I described above. You can retrieve cost and usage data that is filtered and grouped across multiple dimensions (Service, Linked Account, tag, Availability Zone, and so forth), aggregated by day or by month. This gives you the power to start simple (total monthly costs) and to refine your requests to any desired level of detail (writes to DynamoDB tables that have been tagged as <strong>production</strong>) while getting responses in seconds.</p> 
<p>Here are the operations:</p> 
<p><img style="float: right;border: 1px solid black;margin-left: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/api_ce_2.png" width="400" height="227" /><code>GetCostAndUsage</code> – Retrieve cost and usage metrics for a single account or all accounts (master accounts in an organization have access to all member accounts) with filtering and grouping.</p> 
<p><code>GetDimensionValues</code> – Retrieve available filter values for a specified filter over a specified period of time.</p> 
<p><code>GetTags</code> – Retrieve available tag keys and tag values over a specified period of time.</p> 
<p><code>GetReservationUtilization</code> – Retrieve EC2 Reserved Instance utilization over a specified period of time, with daily or monthly granularity plus filtering and grouping.</p> 
<p>I believe that these functions, and the data that they return, will give you the ability to do some really interesting things that will give you better insights into your business. For example, you could tag the resources used to support individual marketing campaigns or development projects and then deep-dive into the costs to measure business value. You now have the potential to know, down to the penny, how much you spend on infrastructure for important events like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Monday">Cyber Monday</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping)">Black Friday</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Things to Know</strong></span><br /> Here are a couple of things to keep in mind as you start to think about ways to make use of the API:</p> 
<p><strong>Grouping</strong> – The Cost Explorer web application provides you with one level of grouping; the APIs give you two. For example you could group costs or RI utilization by Service and then by Region.</p> 
<p><strong>Pagination</strong> – The functions can return very large amounts of data and follow the AWS-wide model for pagination by including a <code>nextPageToken</code> if additional data is available. You simply call the same function again, supplying the token, to move forward.</p> 
<p><strong>Regions</strong> – The service endpoint is in the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span> Region and returns usage data for all public AWS Regions.</p> 
<p><strong>Pricing </strong>– Each API call costs $0.01. To put this into perspective, let’s say you use this API to build a dashboard and it gets 1000 hits per month from your users. Your operating cost for the dashboard should be $10 or so; this is far less expensive than setting up your own systems to extract &amp; ingest the data and respond to interactive queries.</p> 
<p>The Cost Explorer API is available now and you can start using it today. To learn more, read about the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-explorer-api.html">Cost Explorer API</a>.</p>

<p>We don’t often recognize or celebrate anniversaries at AWS. With nearly 100 services on our list, we’d be eating cake and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f45Uo5rw6YY">drinking champagne</a> several times a week. While that might sound like fun, we’d rather spend our working hours listening to customers and innovating. With that said, <a href="https://quicksight.aws" title="">Amazon QuickSight</a> has now been generally available for a little over a year and I would like to give you a quick update!</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>QuickSight in Action</strong></span><br /> Today, tens of thousands of customers (from startups to enterprises, in industries as varied as transportation, legal, mining, and healthcare) are using QuickSight to analyze and report on their business data.</p> 
<p>Here are a couple of examples:</p> 
<p><a href="https://gemini.legal/"><img style="float: right" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/qs_gemini_1.png" /></a><a href="https://gemini.legal/"><strong>Gemini</strong></a> provides legal evidence procurement for California attorneys who represent injured workers. They have gone from creating custom reports and running one-off queries to creating and sharing dynamic QuickSight dashboards with drill-downs and filtering. QuickSight is used to track sales pipeline, measure order throughput, and to locate bottlenecks in the order processing pipeline.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.jivochat.com/"><img style="float: right" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/qs_jivochat_1.png" /></a><strong><a href="https://www.jivochat.com/">Jivochat</a></strong> provides a real-time messaging platform to connect visitors to website owners. QuickSight lets them create and share interactive dashboards while also providing access to the underlying datasets. This has allowed them to move beyond the sharing of static spreadsheets, ensuring that everyone is looking at the same data and is empowered to make timely decisions based on current data.</p> 
<p><a href="http://transfix.io/"><img style="float: right" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/qs_transfix_2.png" width="261" height="71" /></a><strong><a href="http://transfix.io/">Transfix</a></strong> is a tech-powered freight marketplace that matches loads and increases visibility into logistics for Fortune 500 shippers in retail, food and beverage, manufacturing, and other industries. QuickSight has made analytics accessible to both BI engineers and non-technical business users. They scrutinize key business and operational metrics including shipping routes, carrier efficient, and process automation.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Looking Back / Looking Ahead</strong></span><br /> The feedback on QuickSight has been incredibly helpful. Customers tell us that their employees are using QuickSight to connect to their data, perform analytics, and make high-velocity, data-driven decisions, all without setting up or running their own BI infrastructure. We love all of the feedback that we get, and use it to drive our roadmap, leading to the introduction of over 40 new features in just a year. Here’s a summary:</p>

<p>Looking forward, we are watching an interesting trend develop within our customer base. As these customers take a close look at how they analyze and report on data, they are realizing that a serverless approach offers some tangible benefits. They use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" title="">Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</a> as a data lake and query it using a combination of QuickSight and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/athena" title="">Amazon Athena</a>, giving them agility and flexibility without static infrastructure. They also make great use of QuickSight’s dashboards feature, monitoring business results and operational metrics, then sharing their insights with hundreds of users. You can read <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/building-a-serverless-analytics-solution-for-cleaner-cities/">Building a Serverless Analytics Solution for Cleaner Cities</a> and review <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/serverless-big-data-analytics-with-amazon-athena-and-amazon-quicksight-may-2017-aws-online-tech-talks">Serverless Big Data Analytics using Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight</a> if you are interested in this approach.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>New Features and Enhancements</strong></span><br /> We’re still doing our best to listen and to learn, and to make sure that QuickSight continues to meet your needs. I’m happy to announce that we are making seven big additions today:</p> 
<p><strong>Geospatial Visualization</strong> – You can now create geospatial visuals on geographical data sets.</p> 
<p><strong>Private VPC Access</strong> – You can now sign up to access a preview of a new feature that allows you to securely connect to data within VPCs or on-premises, without the need for public endpoints.</p> 
<p><strong>Flat Table Support</strong> – In addition to pivot tables, you can now use flat tables for tabular reporting. To learn more, read about <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/tabular.html">Using Tabular Reports</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>Calculated SPICE Fields</strong> – You can now perform run-time calculations on SPICE data as part of your analysis. Read <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/adding-a-calculated-field-analysis.html">Adding a Calculated Field to an Analysis</a> for more information.</p> 
<p><strong>Wide Table Support</strong> – You can now use tables with up to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/data-source-limits.html">1000 columns</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>Other Buckets</strong> – You can summarize the long tail of high-cardinality data into buckets, as described in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/working-with-visual-types.html">Working with Visual Types in Amazon QuickSight</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>HIPAA Compliance</strong> – You can now run HIPAA-compliant workloads on QuickSight.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Geospatial Visualization</strong></span><br /> Everyone seems to want this feature! You can now take data that contains a geographic identifier (country, city, state, or zip code) and create beautiful visualizations with just a few clicks. QuickSight will geocode the identifier that you supply, and can also accept lat/long map coordinates. You can use this feature to visualize sales by state, map stores to shipping destinations, and so forth. Here’s a sample visualization:</p> 
<p><img class="size-medium aligncenter" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/qs_geo_1.png" width="900" height="570" /></p> 
<p>To learn more about this feature, read <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/geospatial-charts.html">Using Geospatial Charts (Maps)</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/geospatial-data-prep.html">Adding Geospatial Data</a>.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Private VPC Access</strong><strong> Preview</strong></span><br /> If you have data in AWS (perhaps in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/" title="">Amazon Redshift</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" title="">Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)</a>, or on EC2) or on-premises in Teradata or SQL Server on servers without public connectivity, this feature is for you. Private VPC Access for QuickSight uses an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) for secure, private communication with data sources in a VPC. It also allows you to use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/" title="">AWS Direct Connect</a> to create a secure, private link with your on-premises resources.</p> 
<p>Here’s what it looks like:</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2017/qs_vpc_private_2.png" width="910" height="375" /></p> 
<p>If you are ready to join the preview, you can <a href="https://pages.awscloud.com/quicksightprivatevpcpreview.html">sign up today</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this year we <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-ec2-instances-with-4-tb-of-memory/">launched</a> the <strong>x1e.32xlarge</strong> instances in four AWS Regions with 4 TB of memory. Today, two months after that launch, customers are using these instances to run high-performance relational and NoSQL databases, in-memory databases, and other enterprise applications that are able to take advantage of large amounts of memory.</p> 
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Five More Sizes of X1e</strong></span><br /> I am happy to announce that we are extending the memory-optimized X1e family with five additional instance sizes. Here’s the lineup:</p>

<p>As part of today’s launch we are also making all sizes of X1e available in the <span title="">Asia Pacific (Sydney)</span> Region. This means that you can now launch them in On-Demand and Reserved Instance form in the <span title="">US East (Northern Virginia)</span>, <span title="">US West (Oregon)</span>, <span title="">EU (Ireland)</span>, <span title="">Asia Pacific (Tokyo)</span>, and <span title="">Asia Pacific (Sydney)</span> Regions.</p>

<p>Effective immediately, we are increasing the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/sla/">EC2 Service Level Agreement</a> (SLA) for both EC2 and EBS to 99.99%, for all regions and for all AWS customers. This change was made possible by our continuous investment in infrastructure and quality of service, along with our focus on operational excellence.</p>

<p>At last year’s AWS re:Invent we launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-opsworks-for-chef-automate/">AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate</a> which enabled customers to get their own Chef Automate server, managed by AWS. Building on customer feedback we’re excited to bring Puppet Enterprise to OpsWorks today.</p> 
<p>Puppet Enterprise allows you to automate provisioning, configuring, and managing instances through a <i>puppet-agent</i> deployed on each managed node. You can define a configuration once and apply it to thousands of nodes with automatic rollback and drift detection. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/puppetenterprise/">AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise</a> eliminates the need to maintain your own Puppet masters while working seamlessly with your existing Puppet manifests.</p> 
<p>OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise will manage the Puppet master server for you and take care of operational tasks like installation, upgrades, and backups. It also simplifies node registration and offers a useful starter kit for bootstrapping your nodes. More details below.</p> 
<h3>Creating a Managed Puppet Master</h3> 
<p>Creating a Puppet master in OpsWorks is simple. First navigate to the OpsWorks console <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/cm/home#/puppet/">Puppet</a> section and click “Create Puppet Enterprise Server”.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21867" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/15/ops_puppet_1.png" alt="" width="1280" height="589" /></p> 
<p>On this first part of the setup you configure the region and EC2 instance type for your Puppet master. A <i>c4.large</i> can support up to 450 nodes while a <i>c4.2xlarge</i> can support 1600+ nodes. Your Puppet Enterprise server will be provisioned with the newest version of Amazon Linux (2017.09) and the most current version of Puppet Enterprise (2017.3.2).</p> 
<p>On the next screen of the setup you can optionally configure an SSH key to connect your Puppet master. This is useful if you’ll be making any major customizations but it’s a good general practice to interact with Puppet through the client tools rather than directly on the instance itself.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21866" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/15/ops_puppet_2.png" alt="" width="1280" height="732" /></p> 
<p>Also on this page, you can setup an <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/r10k">r10k</a> repo to pull dynamic configurations.</p> 
<p>In the advanced settings page you can select the usual deployment options around VPCs, security groups, IAM roles, and instance profiles. If you choose to have OpsWorks create the instance security group for you, do note that it will be open by default so it’s important to restrict access to this later.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21865" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/15/ops_puppet_3-1.png" alt="" width="934" height="910" /></p> 
<p>Two components to pay attention to on this page are the maintenance window and backup configurations. When new minor versions of Puppet software become available, system maintenance is designed to update the minor version of Puppet Enterprise on your Puppet master automatically, as soon as it passes AWS testing. AWS performs extensive testing to verify that Puppet upgrades are production-ready and will deploy without disrupting existing customer environments. Automated backups allow you to store durable backups of your Puppet master in S3 and to restore from those backups at anytime. You can adjust the backup frequency and retention based on your business needs.</p> 
<h3>Using AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise</h3> 
<p>While your Puppet master is provisioning there are two helpful information boxes provided in the console.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21873" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/15/ops_puppet_4_2.png" alt="" width="1280" height="725" /></p> 
<p>You can download your sign-in credentials as well as sample <i>userdata</i> for installing the puppet-agent onto your Windows and Linux nodes. An important note here is that you’re able to manage your on-premises nodes as well, provided they have connectivity to your Puppet master.</p> 
<p>Once your Puppet master is fully provisioned you can access the Puppet Enterprise http console and use Puppet as you normally would.</p> 
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21863" style="border: 1px solid black" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2017/11/15/ops_puppet_5.png" alt="" width="1280" height="651" /></p> 
<h3>Useful Details</h3> 
<p>AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise is priced in Node Hours for your managed nodes. Prices start at $0.017 per-node-hour and decrease with volume of nodes – you can see the full pricing page <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/puppetenterprise/pricing/">here</a>. You’ll also pay for the underlying resources required to run your Puppet master. At launch AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise is available in US East (N. Virginia) Region, US West (Oregon) Region, and EU (Ireland) Region. Of course everything you’ve seen in the console can also be accomplished through the AWS SDKs and CLI. You can get more information in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/gettingstarted-opspup.html">Getting Started Guide</a>.</p>
