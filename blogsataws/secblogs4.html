<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS, formerly called Secure Sockets Layer [SSL]) is essential for encrypting information that is exchanged on the internet. For example, Amazon.com uses TLS for all traffic on its website, and AWS uses it to secure calls to AWS services.</p> 
<p>An electronic document called a <em>certificate</em>&nbsp;verifies the identity of the server when creating such an encrypted connection. The certificate helps establish proof that your web browser is communicating securely with the website that you typed in your browser’s address field. <em>Certificate Authorities</em>, also known as CAs, issue certificates to specific domains. When a domain presents a certificate that is issued by a trusted CA, your browser or application knows it’s safe to make the connection.</p> 
<p>In January 2016, AWS launched <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/acm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Certificate Manager</a> (ACM), a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy SSL/TLS certificates for use with AWS services. These certificates are available for no additional charge through Amazon’s own CA: <a href="https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Trust Services</a>. For browsers and other applications to trust a certificate, the certificate’s issuer must be included in the browser’s <em>trust store</em>, which is a list of trusted CAs. If the issuing CA is not in the trust store, the browser will display an error message (see an <a href="https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example</a>) and applications will show an application-specific error. To ensure the ubiquity of the Amazon Trust Services CA, AWS purchased the Starfield Services CA, a root found in most browsers and which has been valid since 2005. This means you shouldn’t have to take any action to use the certificates issued by Amazon Trust Services.</p> 
<p>AWS has been offering free certificates to AWS customers from the Amazon Trust Services CA. Now, AWS is in the process of moving certificates for services such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EC2</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon DynamoDB</a> to use certificates from Amazon Trust Services as well. Most software doesn’t need to be changed to handle this transition, but there are exceptions. In this blog post, I show you how to verify that you are prepared to use the Amazon Trust Services CA.</p> 
<h3>How to tell if the Amazon Trust Services CAs are in your trust store</h3> 
<p>The following table lists the Amazon Trust Services certificates. To verify that these certificates are in your browser’s trust store, click each Test URL in the following table to verify that it works for you. When a Test URL does not work, it displays an error similar to <a href="https://untrusted-root.badssl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this example</a>.<span id="more-5777"></span></p>

<h3>What to do if the Amazon Trust Services CAs are not in your trust store</h3> 
<p>If your tests of any of the Test URLs failed, you must update your trust store. The easiest way to update your trust store is to upgrade the operating system or browser that you are using.</p> 
<p>You will find the Amazon Trust Services CAs in the following operating systems (release dates are in parentheses):</p> 
<li>Microsoft Windows versions that have January 2005 or later updates installed, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and newer versions</li> 
<li>Mac OS X 10.4 with Java for Mac OS X 10.4 Release 5, Mac OS X 10.5 and newer versions</li> 
<li>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (March 2007), Linux 6, and Linux 7 and CentOS 5, CentOS 6, and CentOS 7</li> 
<li>Ubuntu 8.10</li> 
<li>Debian 5.0</li> 
<li>Amazon Linux (all versions)</li> 
<li>Java 1.4.2_12, Java 5 update 2, and all newer versions, including Java 6, Java 7, and Java 8</li> 
<p>All modern browsers trust Amazon’s CAs. You can update the certificate bundle in your browser simply by updating your browser. You can find instructions for updating the following browsers on their respective websites:</p> 
<li><a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95414?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome</a></li> 
<li><a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/update-firefox-latest-version" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox</a></li> 
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Safari</a></li> 
<li>The Windows operating system manages certificate bundles for <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/which-version-am-i-using#ie=other" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge</a>, so you must update Windows as well.</li> 
<p>If your application is using a custom trust store, you must add the <a href="https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon root CAs</a> to your application’s trust store. The instructions for doing this vary based on the application or platform. Please refer to the documentation for the application or platform you are using.</p> 
<h4>AWS SDKs and CLIs</h4> 
<p>Most&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS SDKs and CLIs</a> are not impacted by the transition to the Amazon Trust Services CA. If you are using a version of the Python AWS SDK or CLI released before October 29, 2013, you&nbsp;must upgrade. The .NET, Java, PHP, Go, JavaScript, and C++ SDKs and CLIs do not bundle any certificates, so their certificates come from the underlying operating system. The Ruby SDK has included at least one of the required CAs since June 10, 2015. Before that date, the Ruby V2 SDK did not bundle certificates.</p> 
<h3>Certificate pinning</h3> 
<p>If you are using a technique called <em>certificate pinning</em> to lock down the CAs you trust on a domain-by-domain basis, you must adjust your pinning to include the Amazon Trust Services CAs. Certificate pinning helps defend you from an attacker&nbsp;using&nbsp;misissued certificates to fool an application into creating a connection to a spoofed host (an illegitimate host masquerading as a legitimate host). The restriction to a specific, pinned certificate is made by checking that the certificate issued is the expected certificate. This is done by checking that the hash of the certificate public key received from the server matches the expected hash stored in the application. If the hashes do not match, the code stops the connection.</p> 
<p>AWS recommends against using certificate pinning because it introduces a potential availability risk. If the certificate to which you pin is replaced, your application will fail to connect. If your use case requires pinning, we&nbsp;recommend that you pin to a CA rather than to an individual certificate. If you are pinning to an Amazon Trust Services CA, you should pin to all&nbsp;CAs shown in the table earlier in this post.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon ElastiCache for Redis</a> now supports encryption for secure internode communications to help keep personally identifiable information (PII) safe. Both encryption in transit and at rest are supported. The new encryption in-transit feature enables you to encrypt all communications between clients and Redis servers as well as between Redis servers (primary and read replica nodes). The encryption at-rest feature allows you to encrypt your ElastiCache for Redis backups on disk and in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon S3</a>. Additionally, you can use the Redis <span style="font-family: courier">AUTH</span> command for an added level of authentication.</p> 
<p>If you are in the Financial Services, Healthcare, and Telecommunications sectors, this new encryption functionality can help you protect your sensitive data sets and meet compliance requirements. You can start using the new functionality by enabling it at the time of cluster creation via the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ElastiCache console</a> or through the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/APIReference/API_CreateReplicationGroup.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API</a>. You don’t have to manage the lifecycle of your certificates because ElastiCache for Redis automatically manages the issuance, renewal, and expiration of your certificates. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/in-transit-encryption.html#in-transit-encryption-enable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enabling In-Transit Encryption</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/UserGuide/at-rest-encryption.html#at-rest-encryption-enable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enabling At-Rest Encryption</a>.</p> 
<p>There is no additional charge to use this feature, and it is available in the US West (Oregon), US West (N. California), US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia),&nbsp;Canada (Central), EU (Ireland), and South America (S&atilde;o Paulo) Regions. We will make this feature available in other AWS Regions as well.</p>

<p>Today, AWS introduced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory</a> (Standard Edition), also known as AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition), which is managed Microsoft Active Directory (AD) that is performance optimized for small and midsize businesses. AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) offers you a highly available and cost-effective primary directory in the AWS Cloud that you can use to manage users, groups, and computers. It enables you to join <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EC2</a> instances to your domain easily and supports many <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS and third-party applications and services</a>. It also can support most of the common use cases of small and midsize businesses. When you use AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) as your primary directory, you can manage access and provide single sign-on (SSO) to cloud applications such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-enable-your-users-to-access-office-365-with-aws-microsoft-active-directory-credentials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Office 365</a>. If you have an existing Microsoft AD directory, you can also use AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) as a resource forest that contains primarily computers and groups, allowing you to migrate your AD-aware applications to the AWS Cloud while using existing on-premises AD credentials.</p> 
<p>In this blog post, I help you get started by answering three main questions about AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition):</p> 
<ol> 
<li>What do I get?</li> 
<li>How can I use it?</li> 
<li>What are the key features?</li> 
</ol> 
<p>After answering these questions, I show how you can get started with creating and using your own AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) directory.<span id="more-5623"></span></p> 
<h3>1. What do I get?</h3> 
<p>When you create an AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) directory, AWS deploys two Microsoft AD domain controllers powered by Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 in your <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Virtual Private Cloud</a> (VPC). To help deliver high availability, the domain controllers run in different <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Availability Zones</a> in the AWS Region of your choice.</p> 
<p>As a managed service, AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) configures directory replication, automates daily snapshots, and handles all patching and software updates. In addition, AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) monitors and automatically recovers domain controllers in the event of a failure.</p> 
<p>AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) has been optimized as a primary directory for small and midsize businesses with the&nbsp;capacity to support approximately 5,000 employees. With 1 GB of directory object storage, AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) has the capacity to store 30,000 or more total directory objects (users, groups, and computers). AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) also gives you the option to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-increase-the-redundancy-and-performance-of-your-aws-directory-service-for-microsoft-ad-directory-by-adding-domain-controllers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add domain controllers</a> to meet the specific performance demands of your applications. You also can use AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) as a resource forest with a <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/tutorial_setup_trust.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trust relationship</a> to your on-premises directory.</p> 
<h3>2. How can I use it?</h3> 
<p>With AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition), you can share a single directory for multiple use cases. For example, you can share a directory to authenticate and authorize access for .NET applications, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon RDS for SQL Server</a> with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_SQLServerWinAuth.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Authentication</a> enabled, and <a href="https://chime.aws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Chime</a> for messaging and video conferencing.</p> 
<p>The following diagram shows some of the use cases for your AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) directory, including the ability to grant your users access to external cloud applications and allow your on-premises AD users to manage and have access to resources in the AWS Cloud. <strong>Click the diagram to see a larger version</strong>.</p> 
<p><a href="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/10/22/standardedition_usecases_1017_large.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/10/22/standardedition_usecases_1017_large.png" /></a></p> 
<h4>Use case 1: Sign in to AWS applications and services with AD credentials</h4> 
<p>You can enable multiple AWS applications and services such as the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Management Console</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon WorkSpaces</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/sqlserver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon RDS for SQL Server</a> to use your AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) directory. When you enable an AWS application or service in your directory, your users can access the application or service with their AD credentials.</p> 
<p>For example, you can enable your users to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-access-the-aws-management-console-using-aws-microsoft-ad-and-your-on-premises-credentials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign in to the AWS Management Console with their AD credentials</a>. To do this, you enable the AWS Management Console as an application in your directory,&nbsp;and then assign your AD users and groups to IAM roles. When your users sign in to the AWS Management Console, they assume an IAM role to manage AWS resources. This makes it easy for you to grant your users access to the AWS Management Console without&nbsp;needing to configure and manage a separate SAML infrastructure.</p> 
<h4>Use case 2: Manage Amazon EC2 instances</h4> 
<p>Using familiar AD administration tools, you can apply AD Group Policy objects (GPOs) to centrally manage your Amazon EC2 for Windows or Linux instances by <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/join_a_directory.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joining your instances to your AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) domain</a>.</p> 
<p>In addition, your users can sign in to your instances with their AD credentials. This eliminates the need to use individual instance credentials or distribute private key (PEM) files. This makes it easier for you to instantly grant or revoke access to users by using AD user administration tools you already use.</p> 
<h4>Use case 3: Provide directory services to your AD-aware workloads</h4> 
<p>AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) is an actual Microsoft AD that enables you to run traditional AD-aware workloads such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-enable-the-use-of-remote-desktops-by-deploying-microsoft-remote-desktop-licensing-manager-on-aws-microsoft-ad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote Desktop Licensing Manager</a>, <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=4636" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft SharePoint, and Microsoft SQL Server Always On</a> in the AWS Cloud. AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) also helps you to simplify and improve the security of AD-integrated .NET applications by using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/05/simplify-migration-and-improve-security-of-active-directory-integrated-net-applications-by-using-aws-microsoft-ad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs) and Kerberos constrained delegation (KCD).</a></p> 
<h4>Use case 4: SSO to Office 365 and other cloud applications</h4> 
<p>You can use AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) to provide SSO for cloud applications. You can use Azure AD Connect to synchronize your users into Azure AD, and then use Active Directory Federation Services (AD&nbsp;FS) so that your users can access Microsoft Office 365 and other SAML 2.0 cloud applications by using their AD credentials.</p> 
<h4>Use case 5: Extend your on-premises AD to the AWS Cloud</h4> 
<p>If you already have an AD infrastructure and want to use it when migrating AD-aware workloads to the AWS Cloud, AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) can help. You can use AD trusts to connect AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) to your existing AD. This means your users can access AD-aware and AWS applications with their on-premises AD credentials, without needing you to synchronize users, groups, or passwords.</p> 
<p>For example, your users can sign in to the AWS Management Console and Amazon WorkSpaces by using their existing AD user names and passwords. Also, when you use AD-aware applications such as SharePoint with AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition), your logged-in Windows users can access these applications without needing to enter credentials again.</p> 
<h3>3. What are the key features?</h3> 
<p>AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) includes the features detailed in this section.</p> 
<h4>Extend your AD schema</h4> 
<p>With AWS Microsoft AD, you can run customized AD-integrated applications that require changes to your directory schema, which defines the structures of your directory. The schema is composed of object classes such as user objects, which contain attributes such as user names. AWS Microsoft AD lets you extend the schema by adding new AD attributes or object classes that are not present in the core AD attributes and classes.</p> 
<p>For example, if you have a human resources application that uses employee badge color to assign specific benefits, you can extend the schema to include a badge color attribute in the user object class of your directory. To learn more, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-add-more-application-support-to-your-microsoft-ad-directory-by-extending-the-schema/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Move More Custom Applications to the AWS Cloud with AWS Directory Service</a>.</p> 
<h4>Create user-specific password policies</h4> 
<p>With user-specific password policies, you can apply specific restrictions and account lockout policies to different types of users in your AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) domain. For example, you can enforce strong passwords and frequent password change policies for administrators, and use less-restrictive policies with moderate account lockout policies for general users.</p> 
<h4>Add domain controllers</h4> 
<p>You can increase the performance and redundancy of your directory by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-increase-the-redundancy-and-performance-of-your-aws-directory-service-for-microsoft-ad-directory-by-adding-domain-controllers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adding domain controllers</a>. This can help improve application performance by enabling directory clients to load-balance their requests across a larger number of domain controllers.</p> 
<h4>Encrypt directory traffic</h4> 
<p>You can use AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) to encrypt Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) communication between your applications and your directory. By enabling LDAP over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS), also called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-enable-ldaps-for-your-aws-microsoft-ad-directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LDAPS</a>, you encrypt your LDAP communications end to end. This helps you to protect sensitive information you keep in your directory when it is accessed over untrusted networks.</p> 
<h4>Improve the security of signing&nbsp;in to AWS services by using multi-factor authentication (MFA)</h4> 
<p>You can improve the security of signing in to AWS services, such as Amazon WorkSpaces and Amazon QuickSight, by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-enable-multi-factor-authentication-for-amazon-workspaces-and-amazon-quicksight-by-using-microsoft-ad-and-on-premises-credentials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enabling MFA in your AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition) directory</a>. With MFA, your users must enter a one-time passcode (OTP) in addition to their AD user names and passwords to access AWS applications and services you enable in AWS Microsoft AD (Standard Edition).</p>

<p>In a previous <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-monitor-aws-account-configuration-changes-and-api-calls-to-amazon-ec2-security-groups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Security Blog post</a>, Jeff Levine showed how you can monitor changes to your <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EC2</a> security groups. The methods he describes in that post are examples of <em>detective controls</em>, which can help you determine when changes are made to security controls on your AWS resources.</p> 
<p>In this post, I take that approach a step further by introducing an example of a <em>responsive control</em>, which you can use to automatically respond to a detected security event by applying a chosen security mitigation. I demonstrate a solution that continuously monitors changes made to an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon VPC</a> <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">security group</a>, and if a new ingress rule (the same as an inbound rule) is added to that security group, the solution removes the rule and then sends you a notification after the changes have been automatically reverted.</p> 
<h3>The scenario</h3> 
<p>Let’s say you want to reduce your infrastructure complexity by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/replacing-a-bastion-host-with-amazon-ec2-systems-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replacing your Secure Shell (SSH) bastion hosts</a> with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/systems-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EC2 Systems Manager</a> (SSM). SSM allows you to run commands on your hosts remotely, removing the need to manage bastion hosts&nbsp;or rely on SSH to execute commands. To support this objective, you must prevent your staff members from opening SSH ports to your web server’s Amazon VPC security group. If one of your staff members does modify the VPC security group to allow SSH access, you want the change to be automatically reverted and then receive a notification that the change to the security group was automatically reverted. If you are not yet familiar with security groups, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Security Groups for Your VPC</a> before reading the rest of this post.<span id="more-5393"></span></p> 
<h3>Solution overview</h3> 
<p>This solution begins with a <em>directive</em> <em>control</em> to mandate that no web server should be accessible using SSH. The directive control is enforced using a <em>preventive</em> <em>control,</em> which is implemented using a security group rule that prevents ingress from port 22 (typically used for SSH). The detective control is a “listener” that identifies any changes made to your security group. Finally, the responsive control reverts changes made to the security group and then sends a notification of this security mitigation.</p> 
<p>The detective control, in this case, is an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon CloudWatch</a> event that detects changes to your security group and triggers the responsive control, which in this case is an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Lambda</a> function. I use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS CloudFormation</a> to simplify the deployment.</p> 
<p>The following diagram shows the architecture of this solution.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/10/09/Annotated-Flow-FINAL.png" /></p> 
<p>Here is how the process works:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Someone on your staff adds a new ingress rule to your security group.</li> 
<li>A CloudWatch event that continually monitors changes to your security groups detects the new ingress rule and invokes a designated Lambda function (with Lambda, you can run code without provisioning or managing servers).</li> 
<li>The Lambda function evaluates the event to determine whether you are monitoring this security group and reverts the new security group ingress rule.</li> 
<li>Finally, the Lambda function sends you an email to let you know what the change was, who made it, and that the change was reverted.</li> 
</ol> 
<h3>Deploy the solution by using CloudFormation</h3> 
<p>In this section, you will click the <strong>Launch Stack</strong> button shown below to launch the CloudFormation stack and deploy the solution.</p> 
<h4>Prerequisites</h4> 
<li>You must have <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS CloudTrail</a> already enabled in the AWS Region where you will be deploying the solution. CloudTrail lets you log, continuously monitor, and retain events related to API calls across your AWS infrastructure. See <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-getting-started.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting Started with CloudTrail</a> for more information.</li> 
<li>You must have a default VPC in the region in which you will be deploying the solution. AWS accounts have one default VPC per AWS Region. If you’ve deleted your VPC, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/default-vpc.html#create-default-vpc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creating a Default VPC</a> to recreate it.</li> 
<h4>Resources that this solution creates</h4> 
<p>When you launch the CloudFormation stack, it creates the following resources:</p> 
<li>A sample VPC security group in your default VPC, which is used as the target for reverting ingress rule changes.</li> 
<li>A CloudWatch event rule that monitors changes to your AWS infrastructure.</li> 
<li>A Lambda function that reverts changes to the security group and sends you email notifications.</li> 
<li>A permission that allows CloudWatch to invoke your Lambda function.</li> 
<li>An <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Identity and Access Management</a> (IAM) role with limited privileges that the Lambda function assumes when it is executed.</li> 
<li>An <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon SNS</a> topic to which the Lambda function publishes notifications.</li> 
<h4>Launch the CloudFormation stack</h4> 
<p>The link in this section uses the <span style="font-family: courier">us-east-1</span> Region (the US East [N. Virginia] Region). Change the region if you want to use this solution in a different region. See <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/getting-started.html#select-region" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selecting a Region</a> for more information about changing the region.</p> 
<p>To deploy the solution, click the following <strong>Launch Stack</strong> button to launch the stack.&nbsp;After you click the button, you must sign in to the AWS Management Console if you have not already done so.</p> 
<p><a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=security-group-change-auto-response&amp;templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/awsiammedia/public/sample/revertsecuritygroupchanges/security-group-change-auto-response.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/10/09/Launch-Stack.png" /></a></p> 
<p>Then:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Choose <strong>Next</strong> to proceed to the <strong>Specify Details</strong> page.</li> 
<li>On the <strong>Specify Details</strong> page, type your email address in the <strong>Send notifications to</strong>&nbsp;box. This is the email address to which change notifications will be sent. (After the stack is launched, you will receive a confirmation email that you must accept before you can receive notifications.)</li> 
<li>Choose <strong>Next</strong> until you get to the <strong>Review</strong> page, and then choose the <strong>I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources</strong> check box. This confirms that you are aware that the CloudFormation template includes an IAM resource.</li> 
<li>Choose <strong>Create</strong>. CloudFormation displays the stack status, <strong>CREATE_COMPLETE</strong>, when the stack has launched completely, which should take less than two minutes.<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/10/10/createcomplete_RB101017-a.png" /></li> 
</ol> 
<h3>Testing the solution</h3> 
<ol> 
<li>Check your email for the SNS confirmation email. You must confirm this subscription to receive future notification emails. If you don’t confirm the subscription, your security group ingress rules still will be automatically reverted, but you will not receive notification emails.</li> 
<li>Navigate to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EC2 console</a> and choose <strong>Security Groups</strong> in the navigation pane.</li> 
<li>Choose the security group created by CloudFormation. Its name is <strong>Web Server Security Group</strong>.</li> 
<li>Choose the <strong>Inbound</strong> tab in the bottom pane of the page. Note that only one rule allows HTTPS ingress on port 443 from <span style="font-family: courier">0.0.0.0/0</span> (from anywhere).<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/10/10/edit-inboundtab_RB101017.png" /></li> 
</ol> 
<ol start="5"> 
<li>Choose <strong>Edit</strong> to display the <strong>Edit inbound rules</strong> dialog box (again, an inbound rule and an ingress rule are the same thing).</li> 
<li>Choose <strong>Add Rule</strong>.</li> 
<li>Choose <strong>SSH</strong> from the <strong>Type</strong> drop-down list.</li> 
<li>Choose <strong>My IP</strong> from the <strong>Source</strong> drop-down list. Your IP address is populated for you. By adding this rule, you are simulating one of your staff members violating your organization’s policy (in this blog post’s hypothetical example) against allowing SSH access to your EC2 servers. You are testing the solution created when you launched the CloudFormation stack in the previous section. The solution should remove this newly created SSH rule automatically.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/10/10/editinboundrules_RB101017-c.png" /></li> 
<li>Choose <strong>Save</strong>.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Adding this rule creates an EC2 <span style="font-family: courier">AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress</span> service event, which triggers the Lambda function created in the CloudFormation stack. After a few moments, choose the refresh button (&nbsp;<img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/10/09/refresh.png" />&nbsp;) to see that the new SSH ingress rule that you just created has been removed by the solution you deployed earlier with the CloudFormation stack. If the rule is still there, wait a few more moments and choose the refresh button again.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/10/10/refreshbutton_RB101017.png" /></p> 
<p>You should also receive an email to notify you that the ingress rule was added and subsequently reverted.</p> 
<p><img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/10/10/Notification-Email-a.png" /></p> 
<h3>Cleaning up</h3> 
<p>If you want to remove the resources created by this CloudFormation stack, you can delete the CloudFormation stack:</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Navigate to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CloudFormation console</a>.</li> 
<li>Choose the stack that you created earlier.</li> 
<li>Choose the <strong>Actions</strong> drop-down list.</li> 
<li>Choose <strong>Delete Stack</strong>, and then choose <strong>Yes, Delete</strong>.</li> 
<li>CloudFormation will display a status of <strong>DELETE_IN_PROGRESS</strong> while it deletes the resources created with the stack. After a few moments, the stack should no longer appear in the list of completed stacks.<br /> <img width="100%" src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/22d200f8670dbdb3e253a90eee5098477c95c23d/2017/10/10/deleteinprogress_RB101017-a.png" /></li> 
</ol> 
<h3>Other applications of this solution</h3> 
<p>I have shown one way to use multiple AWS services to help continuously ensure that your security controls haven’t deviated from your security baseline. However, you also could use the <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-security-benchmark" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmarks</a>, for example, to establish a governance baseline across your AWS accounts and then use the principles in this blog post to automatically mitigate changes to that baseline.</p> 
<p>To scale this solution, you can create a framework that uses <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/answers/account-management/aws-tagging-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resource tags</a> to identify particular resources for monitoring. You also can use a consolidated monitoring approach by using cross-account event delivery. See <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/CloudWatchEvents-CrossAccountEventDelivery.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sending and Receiving Events Between AWS Accounts</a> for more information. You also can extend the principle of automatic mitigation to detect and revert changes to other resources such as IAM policies and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon S3</a> bucket policies.</p> 
<h3>Summary</h3> 
<p>In this blog post, I demonstrated how you can automatically revert changes to a VPC security group and have a notification sent about the changes. You can use this solution in your own AWS accounts to enforce your security requirements continuously.</p>
