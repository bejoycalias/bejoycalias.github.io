<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 29, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>You can now use Amazon CloudWatch Events to react to resource configuration and compliance change notifications from AWS Config. AWS Config records configuration changes to your AWS resources and evaluates those changes with respect to best practices and internal guidelines according to AWS Config rules. With this launch, you can now use the native capabilities of CloudWatch Events to filter the notifications coming from AWS Config. CloudWatch Events can then trigger specific actions, such as a running an AWS Lambda function, an AWS Systems Manager command, or terminating an Amazon EC2 instance.</p> 
<p>You can use this capability to create a CloudWatch Events rule to detect noncomplaint notifications for specific resource types or specific rules and trigger Lambda functions to take corrective action. You can also route configuration change notifications for specific resource types to specific targets such as SNS topics or SQS queues.</p> 
<p>This new integration&nbsp;is available in all AWS public Regions where AWS Config is offered and in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region. To see the full list of supported Regions, visit <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#awsconfig_region">AWS Regions and Endpoints</a> in the AWS General Reference.<br /> </p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 29, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Alexa for Business now lets you create address books that make it easier for users to place phone calls from shared Echo devices. With Alexa for Business, you can place Echo devices in common areas like conference rooms, shared workspaces, or hotel rooms. These are called shared Echo devices, and you can make phone calls from these devices. With this feature, you can create address books and assign them to specific shared Echo devices, which lets users ask Alexa to make phone calls by name rather than by speaking phone numbers. IT can add frequently accessed phone numbers to address books, such as an IT helpdesk, or the facilities team, and make it easier for users to access these services.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>You can create address books in the Alexa for Business console by clicking on the <b>Create Address Book</b> link in the <b>Calls</b> tab. Address books can contain frequently used contacts, such as the IT helpdesk, facilities, or the building reception. When an address book is associated with a shared Echo device, users can initiate a call from the device to a contact in the address book by using the contact name. For example, a user trying to reach the IT helpdesk could say “Alexa, call IT”. You can create multiple address books, and assign them to different shared Echo devices. This lets you use different numbers for the same contact when used in different contexts. For example, you might have a unique phone number for the IT helpdesk in each building; creating a unique address book for each building makes it possible for users reach the right IT helpdesk when they need to. To learn more about setting up address books for your shared Echo devices, please visit <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/a4b/latest/ag/manage-calling.html" target="_blank">Managing Calling</a> in the Alexa for Business <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/a4b/latest/ag/what-is.html" target="_blank">Admin Guide</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>You can now take advantage of new features in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker" target="_blank">Amazon SageMaker</a> designed to speed up your training and help you customize your models for both linear regression and binary classification using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/linear-learner.html" target="_blank">the Linear Learner algorithm</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>As part of enhancing Linear Learner, Amazon SageMaker has added automatic early stopping with or without a validation dataset during model tuning. If you provide the Linear Learner algorithm with a validation data set, your model training will stop early once validation loss stops improving. If no validation set is available, model training will stop early when training loss stops improving and reverts to the best model.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In addition, there are several new ways to customize the Linear Learner algorithm for your model training using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ll_hyperparameters.html" target="_blank">new loss functions for the Linear Learner hyperparameters.</a> You can now use eight new loss functions in Amazon SageMaker: Squared Loss, for most regression problems, to estimate the mean; Absolute Loss, to produce estimates of the median; Quantile Loss, to provide a quantile value on which to make predictions (e.g. 0.9 quantile of the distribution); Huber Loss, for training with Squared loss but avoiding outlier sensitivity; Epsilon-Insensitive Loss, for specifying a threshold for acceptable errors; Logistic Regression, for binary classification problems; Hinge Loss, also known as Support Vector Machine (SVM) for binary classifications. Finally, Linear Learner also allows you to specify class weights, for highly unbalanced training data in binary classification problems.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These new features in Amazon SageMaker are available today in the U.S. East (N. Virginia), U.S. East (Ohio), EU (Ireland), and U.S. West (Oregon) AWS Regions.

<p>Amazon Elastic Container Service (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">Amazon ECS</a>) now includes integrated service discovery that makes it easy for your containerized services to discover and connect with each other.<br /> </p> 
<p>Previously, to ensure that services were able to discover and connect with each other, you had to configure and run your own service discovery system or connect every service to a load balancer. Now, you can enable service discovery for your containerized services with a simple selection in the ECS console, AWS CLI, or using the ECS API.<br /> </p> 
<p>Amazon ECS creates and manages a registry of service names using the Route 53 Auto Naming API. Names are automatically mapped to a set of DNS records so you can refer to services by an alias, and have this alias automatically resolve to the service’s endpoint at runtime. You can specify health check conditions in a service's task definition and Amazon ECS will ensure that only healthy service endpoints are returned by a service lookup.<br /> </p> 
<p>When you use Amazon ECS service discovery, you pay for the Route 53 resources that you consume, including each namespace that you create, and for the lookup queries your services make. Service health checks are provided at no cost. For more information on pricing, please see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html#service-discovery-pricing">documentation</a>.&nbsp;Today, service discovery is available for Amazon ECS tasks using AWS Fargate or the EC2 launch type with awsvpc networking mode.</p> 
<p>To learn more, visit the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html">Amazon ECS Service Discovery documentation</a>.</p>

Previously, if you were using S3 as a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/integrations-action-type.html#integrations-source">source action</a>, CodePipeline checked periodically to see if there was a change. Now, S3 will send an Amazon CloudWatch Event when a change is made to your S3 object that triggers a pipeline execution in CodePipeline. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Any S3-based pipeline created from the <a href="http://console.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline">AWS CodePipeline console</a> will use an Amazon CloudWatch Event to trigger a pipeline by default, and any edits to an existing S3-based pipeline in the console will migrate your pipeline to use CloudWatch Events. You can also choose not to use push support by changing the detection option in CodePipeline. If you are creating or updating a S3-based pipeline using the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS Command Line Interface</a>, CodePipeline API, or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation</a>, you will need to take action if you want to take advantage of these new capabilities. Please visit <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/trigger-S3-migration-cwe.html">here</a> for more information about migrating to CloudWatch Events.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 22, 2018</span> </p> 
<p> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/polly/" target="_blank">Amazon Polly</a> is a Text-to-Speech service that uses advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize speech that sounds like a human voice. The new SSML Breath feature mimics the sound of inhalation and/or exhalation during normal speech. With the SSML Breath tag, you can now insert appropriate breath sounds to make the Amazon Polly generated speech sound even more natural, as if the text is being narrated by a human speaker. </p> 
<p>You can use the &lt;amazon:breath&gt; and &lt;amazon:auto-breaths&gt; tags, or a combination of both, to incorporate breath sounds into your speech output.</p> 
<li><b>Automated mode</b>: Amazon Polly inserts breathing sounds automatically into the speech output, to simulate normal breathing without input from you. (You can also set the frequency of these intervals, as well as their volume and duration.)</li> 
<li><b>Manual mode</b>: you set the location, duration, and volume of a breath sound for the text.</li> 
<li><b>Mixed mode</b>: a combination of customized breathing sounds that you insert, and that are inserted automatically by Amazon Polly.</li> 
<p>By incorporating breath sounds into speech output from text, Amazon Polly is able to provide more naturally sounding speech, particularly for long-form narration of text.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Log in the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/polly/home" target="_blank">Amazon Polly console</a> and try the SSML Breath feature, or visit the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/supported-ssml.html">Amazon Polly documentation</a> for more information about SSML tags.</p>

<p>Starting today, you can access your Amazon EC2 Reserved Instance (RI) purchase recommendations programmatically via the AWS Cost Explorer API. RI purchase recommendations are calculated based on your past usage and indicate opportunities for potential cost savings. To tailor your recommendations, you can adjust the RI parameters (e.g., return only recommendations for partial upfront convertible RIs with a one-year term) and the historical time period of usage over which your recommendations are calculated (e.g., last 60 days). Once you have identified the optimal mix of RIs to address your business needs, you can access to the Amazon EC2 RI Purchase Console or use the AWS SDK to take action on your insights and purchase Reserved Instances.<br /> </p> 
<p>To get started accessing your RI purchase recommendations via the AWS Cost Explorer API, please refer to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-explorer-api.html">Using the Cost Explorer API</a> user guide.<br /> </p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 20, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Starting today, Lambda@Edge enables you to further customize the delivery of content stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, by allowing you to access additional whitelisted headers, including custom headers, within origin-facing events. For example, you can configure Amazon CloudFront to cache and forward a country header to your S3 origin, and then use Lambda@Edge to dynamically redirect viewers to country-specific versions of your website, based on the viewer’s location. CloudFront also caches the responses to further improve the performance on subsequent requests to your website.</p> 
<p>Until now, you could configure Amazon CloudFront with an S3 origin to forward and to cache objects based on only three headers: Access-Control-Request-Headers, Access-Control-Request-Method, and Origin. This limited the ability to leverage the full potential of Lambda@Edge, as you could only use cookies and query strings when you wanted to customize the delivery of content stored in S3 buckets. However, with this launch, you can now configure CloudFront with an S3 origin to cache and forward several additional headers, such as CloudFront-Viewer-Country or CloudFront-Is-*-Viewer, and then use Lambda@Edge to customize content based on these headers and deliver at low latencies to your viewers. To see all the supported headers, click <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/RequestAndResponseBehaviorCustomOrigin.html#request-custom-headers-behavior">here</a>.<br /> <br /> There is no additional fee for the new capability.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 15, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>AWS CloudTrail makes it easier to search CloudTrail log files using the power of Amazon Athena. Previously, you had to manually create a CloudTrail table using the Athena console or AWS CLI and ensure you had the proper configuration and data definitions to match the CloudTrail log format. Now, from within the CloudTrail console event history page, you simply enter the Amazon S3 bucket where your CloudTrail logs are stored, and CloudTrail will automatically create the Athena table for you. Once the table is created, you’ll be able to jump directly to the Athena console query editor and immediately begin running queries.</p> 
<p>This allows you to use common SQL queries to search for specific sets of activities recorded by AWS CloudTrail. For example, you can easily identifying console logins from outside the corporate network that didn’t use multi-factor authentication or you can query for API failures for a given resource that occurred during a specific timeframe. There is no cost to setup the integration and create the CloudTrail table within Athena. Running Athena queries within the Athena query editor or using the AWS CLI will incur standard Athena charges. Please visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/athena/pricing/">Amazon Athena pricing</a> page for more information.</p> 
<p>The integration within the AWS CloudTrail console is available in all AWS public regions, as well as the AWS GovCloud (US) Region, the China (Beijing) Region, and the China (Ningxia) Region. Please visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS Region Table</a> page to see the Athena supported regions in which you can create the CloudTrail table and run corresponding queries.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 15, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Starting today, you can now use Amazon CloudFront to negotiate HTTPS connections to origins using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). ECDSA uses smaller keys that are faster, yet, just as secure, as the older RSA algorithm. The smaller keys will also increase the number of TLS handshakes that your origins can process per second, thereby saving compute cycles and reducing your cost of cryptography. To enable ECDSA, simply configure your origin server to use and prefer an ECDSA certificate. There is no additional fee for using this feature. To learn more about how ECDSA works on CloudFront, see the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/cloudfront-now-supports-ecdsa-certificates-for-https-connections-to-origins/">blog post</a> and the CloudFront <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html#secure-connections-supported-ciphers-cloudfront-to-origin">Developer Guide</a>.</p>

<p>Starting today, you can use the Reserved Instance (RI) Coverage report in AWS Cost Explorer to better understand and manage your Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon ElastiCache reservations, in addition to your Amazon EC2 RIs. The RI Coverage report allows you to visualize the percentage of running instance hours that are covered by RIs against a user-defined coverage threshold and over a timeline that you define. You can view RI coverage at a high level (e.g., across all running hours) or dive into a detailed view by filtering on account, instance type, region, tags, and more. You can also access additional coverage-related information such as the number of On-Demand hours used, the node type, and the region in which it was used. From there, you can use this information to optimize your RI purchasing strategy (e.g., by identifying instance hours that are consistently running at on-demand rates and purchase matching RIs).</p> 
<p>Please note that you can also access this information programmatically via the AWS Cost Explorer API.</p> 
<p>To learn more about using the RI Coverage report, please refer to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/" target="_blank">AWS Cost Explorer</a> webpage or the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-explorer-what-is.html" target="_blank">Analyzing Your Costs with Cost Explorer</a> user guide.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 12, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon SNS message filtering now supports both numeric and string matching. Specifically, string matching operators allow for exact, prefix, and “anything-but” comparisons, while numeric matching operators allow for exact and range comparisons. You can leverage this new set of operators to further simplify pub/sub messaging architectures by offloading to SNS message filtering logic from subscribers, as well as routing logic from publishers.</p> 
<p>Amazon SNS is a fully managed pub/sub messaging service. With Amazon SNS, you can use topics to decouple message producers and consumers, and simultaneously distribute messages to multiple subscribing endpoints, such as Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions, HTTP endpoints, email addresses, and mobile devices (SMS, push).</p> 
<p>Amazon SNS filtering operators are available in all commercial AWS regions. Get started by going to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home">AWS Management Console</a>, selecting Amazon SNS, and adding filter policies to your Amazon SNS subscriptions. You can also use the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk">AWS SDK</a> (Software Development Kit), <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#cli">AWS CLI</a> (Command Line Interface), and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/Welcome.html">SNS API</a> (Application Programming Interface). The new set of filtering operators are available at no extra charge.

<b id="Amazon_ECS_Supports_Container_Health_Checks_and_Task_Health_Management"> <a name="Amazon_ECS_Supports_Container_Health_Checks_and_Task_Health_Management"> Amazon ECS Supports Container Health Checks and Task Health Management</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 8, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) now supports Docker container health checks. This gives you more control over monitoring the health of your tasks and improves the ability of the ECS service scheduler to ensure your services are healthy.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, the ECS service scheduler relied on the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to report container health status and to restart unhealthy containers. This required you to configure your ECS Service to use a load balancer, and only supported HTTP and TCP health-checks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now, in addition to supporting ELB health checks, Amazon ECS integrates with Docker container health checks to allow you to explicitly define and monitor the health of each container. Using the HEALTHCHECK command, you can define which parameters to monitor for each container in your Task Definition. Running tasks (groups of running containers) are now assigned a health status based on the health of their essential containers, and the task's health status is integrated with the ECS service scheduler to automatically redeploy unhealthy tasks and conduct rolling-updates of services. You can check the health status of your tasks and containers in the ECS Console or with the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTasks.html" target="_blank">ECS DescribeTasks API</a>.</p> 
<p>To learn more, visit the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#container_definition_healthcheck" target="_blank">Amazon ECS documentation</a>. You can get more information about Amazon ECS on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">product page</a>.</p> 
<p>Amazon ECS is available in US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), US West (N.

<p>The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/">AWS Storage Gateway</a> service expanded the set of CloudWatch Events for File Gateway to help automate hybrid cloud workflows, and now supports &quot;Requester Pays&quot; Amazon S3 buckets.</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/file/">File Gateway</a> enables on-premises applications to access objects in S3 as files. File contents and metadata are cached locally for optimal performance. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/APIReference/API_RefreshCache.html" target="_blank">refresh cache</a> operation synchronizes the local cache with S3. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/monitoring-file-gateway.html#get-notification" target="_blank">new Amazon CloudWatch Event</a> occurs when a refresh cache operation finishes. Combined with file upload notification events, it enables you to automate workflows for data processing and content sharing in a hybrid cloud architecture.</p> 
<p>File Gateway can now access S3 buckets configured as &quot;<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RequesterPaysBuckets.html" target="_blank">Requester Pays</a>&quot;. Typically, bucket owners pay the cost of downloading data, but with &quot;Requester Pays&quot; enabled, the requester pays for requests and data downloads. Such buckets can be used to share public data, such as <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/hst/" target="_blank">Hubble Space Telescope observations</a>, or <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/" target="_blank">USDA Aerial Photography</a>. File Gateway caches frequently used data locally, helping requesters to reduce latency and costs.</p> 
<p>File Gateway appliances can now also run on Amazon EC2 C5/M5 instances, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/managing-gateway-file.html#cross-account-access" target="_blank">support predefined cross-account bucket access</a> using <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Canned Access Control Lists (ACLs)</a>.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Mar 2, 2018</span> </p> 
<p>It is now easy to use Amazon CloudWatch for event-driven AWS Batch workloads by adding AWS Batch as a target for Amazon CloudWatch.&nbsp; Amazon CloudWatch Events enables you to respond quickly to application availability issues or configuration changes that might impact performance or security by notifying you of AWS resource changes in near-real-time. You simply write rules to indicate which events are of interest to your application and what automated action to take when a rule matches an event. You can add AWS Batch as a target by creating an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule and specifying the AWS Batch job ARN. Once the rule matches an event, it starts the job by invoking the Batch Submit-Job API. For example, you can submit a job to AWS Batch in response to an event pattern or on a schedule using Amazon CloudWatch Events. Prior to this feature, customers were required to use services such as AWS Lambda as a workaround to take advantage of Amazon CloudWatch for their event-driven batch workloads. This feature is available in all AWS Public Regions where AWS Batch is available.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>AWS Batch is a fully managed service that automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes the workload distribution based on the volume and resource requirements of submitted jobs. It eliminates the need to install or manage batch computing software. You only pay for the AWS resources (e.g. Amazon EC2 instances) you create to store and run your batch jobs.</p> 
<p>This feature is available effective today in all AWS Regions supported by AWS Batch. AWS Batch is currently available in the following AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), US West (N. California), Canada (Central), EU (Ireland), EU (London), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney) and Asia Pacific (Seoul)</p>
