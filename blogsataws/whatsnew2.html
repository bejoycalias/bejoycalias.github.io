<b id="Amazon_WorkSpaces_Now_Supports_Configurable_Storage_and_Switching_Between_Hardware_Bundles"> <a name="Amazon_WorkSpaces_Now_Supports_Configurable_Storage_and_Switching_Between_Hardware_Bundles"> Amazon WorkSpaces Now Supports Configurable Storage and Switching Between Hardware Bundles</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 28, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Today, Amazon WorkSpaces is making two new features available. First, you can now configure how much storage your WorkSpaces get when you launch them, and increase the storage for a running WorkSpace at any time. Second, you can now change the hardware bundle that your WorkSpace is running on with a simple reboot. All of your applications, data, and storage stay the same, but now you can move to a more powerful bundle to support resource-intensive applications, or move to a less powerful bundle to save costs. With these features, Amazon WorkSpaces now provides additional flexibility to support the diverse needs of end users, while still helping you optimize your costs. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>With configurable storage, you can select your root and user volume starting sizes when you launch a new WorkSpace, and then increase these as needed, up to a limit of 1,000 GB. All data is preserved, and you can continue to use your WorkSpace while your volumes are increased in size. To ensure that your data is preserved, the volume sizes of either volume cannot be reduced after a WorkSpace is launched. To learn more about configurable storage, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/modify-workspaces.html" target="_blank">Modify a WorkSpace.</a></p> 
<p>With hardware bundle switching, you can switch between the Value, Standard, Performance, or Power hardware bundles as needed. You don’t need to delete your WorkSpace and create a new one, and your storage configuration is preserved even after you have configured storage using the configurable storage feature. To learn more about switching between hardware bundles, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/modify-workspaces.html" target="_blank">Modify a WorkSpace</a>.</p> 
<p>These features are available today in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS Regions</a> where Amazon WorkSpaces are offered. To get started, log in to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/workspaces" target="_blank">Amazon WorkSpaces management console</a>.</p> 
<b id="Amazon_ECS_Adds_ELB_Health_Check_Grace_Period"> <a name="Amazon_ECS_Adds_ELB_Health_Check_Grace_Period"> Amazon ECS Adds ELB Health Check Grace Period</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 27, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>The Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) service scheduler now allows you to define a grace period to prevent premature shutdown of newly instantiated tasks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, if Amazon ECS tasks took a long time to start, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) health checks could mark the task as unhealthy and the service scheduler would shut the task down prematurely.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now, you can specify a health check grace period as an Amazon ECS service definition parameter. This instructs the service scheduler to ignore ELB health checks for a pre-defined time period after a task has been instantiated.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To learn more, visit the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service_definition_parameters.html" target="_blank">Amazon ECS documentation</a>. You can get more information about Amazon ECS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">here</a>.</p> 
<p>Amazon ECS is available in US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), South America (S&atilde;o Paulo), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), EU (Frankfurt), EU (Ireland), EU (London), EU (Paris), and China (Beijing) regions.

<b id="Circuit_Breaking_Logic_for_the_Amazon_ECS_Service_Scheduler"> <a name="Circuit_Breaking_Logic_for_the_Amazon_ECS_Service_Scheduler"> Circuit Breaking Logic for the Amazon ECS Service Scheduler</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 22, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>The Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) service scheduler now includes logic that throttles how often tasks are restarted if they repeatedly fail to launch.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Previously, if tasks had issues in the container image, task definition, network configuration, they could fail to become healthy when started by the Amazon ECS service scheduler. Continuous restart attempts by the service scheduler could lead to overall application performance degradation and incur cost.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Now, the Amazon ECS service scheduler includes logic that checks for tasks that continuously fail to become healthy after instantiation, increases the duration between restart attempts, eventually stopping the deployment, and adds an event to the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cloudwatch_event_stream.html">Amazon ECS service event messages</a> so you can take corrective action. This logic works for tasks using both the AWS Fargate and EC2 launch types.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To learn more, visit the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html" target="_blank">Amazon ECS documentation</a>. For more information about Amazon ECS see the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">product page</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon ECS is available in US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon), Canada (Central), South America (S&atilde;o Paulo), Asia Pacific (Mumbai), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), EU (Frankfurt), EU (Ireland), EU (London), EU (Paris), and China (Beijing) regions.

<b id="AWS_Direct_Connect_added_two_new_locations_in_Minneapolis,_MN_and_Bangalore,_India"> <a name="AWS_Direct_Connect_added_two_new_locations_in_Minneapolis,_MN_and_Bangalore,_India"> AWS Direct Connect added two new locations in Minneapolis, MN and Bangalore, India</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 21, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Today AWS Direct Connect has landed sites in two new cities – Minneapolis, MN and Bangalore, India. With global access enabled for AWS Direct Connect, these sites can reach AWS resources in any global AWS region. In the US, Cologix MIN3, Minneapolis brings the total AWS Direct Connect sites in the country to 30. In the AWS Management Console, Minneapolis will be found under its home region of US East (Ohio). In India, NetMagic DC2, Bangalore, is the third city for AWS Direct Connect after Mumbai and Chennai, and will be found in the console under Asia Pacific (Mumbai) region. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Customers in these cities can now establish a dedicated network connection from their premise to AWS. As with any AWS Direct Connect site, these sites conform to the standard resiliency model that includes two customer facing devices per location that allow customers to establish locally resilient connectivity and redundant connectivity to the Amazon backbone network. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections. Connections are always made to a particular Direct Connect location, and can run at either 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps, or work with a partner to connect at speeds less than 1G.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Please see our AWS website for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/details/">details</a> on our locations and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/pricing/">pricing</a>.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 21, 2017</span> </p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/">Amazon Redshift</a> now uses late materialization to reduce the amount of data scanned and improve performance for queries with predicate filters.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Late materialization (row-level filtering) reduces I/O for queries with filters by batching and factoring in the filtering of predicate(s) before fetching data blocks in the next column. For example, consider a query with filters on two columns operating on a CUSTOMER_DETAIL table having a million rows:&nbsp;</p> 
SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, EMAIL, CITY, SALES_REP, 
FROM CUSTOMER_DETAIL 
WHERE CUSTOMER_SINCE_DATE &lt; ’01-01-2000’
AND CUSTOMER_STATUS_LEVEL IN (’Gold’ , ’Silver’) ;
 
<p>With late materialization, Redshift fetches a batch of data from the CUSTOMER_SINCE_DATE and CUSTOMER_STATUS_LEVEL columns, then applies the respective predicates. If only 10% of the CUSTOMER_DETAIL table rows satisfy the predicate filters, Redshift can potentially save 90% of the I/O for remaining columns, thus improving query performance. Also, by scanning columns in batches rather than a row at a time, performance is further improved.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With this release, we have added a new ‘i<i>s_rlf_scan</i>’ column to the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_STL_SCAN.html" target="_blank">STL_SCAN</a> table. If a query uses late materialization, then this column will have a value of 't' or TRUE; otherwise, it will have a value of 'f' or FALSE.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Amazon Redshift enables late materialization by default. It is automatically triggered for a query when Redshift detects that the query can improve performance. With the latest build 1.0.1583, late materialization is available in all AWS regions.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 21, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Starting today, Lambda@Edge enables you to customize error responses from your origin, by allowing you to execute Lambda functions in response to HTTP errors that Amazon CloudFront receives from your origin. This means Lambda@Edge functions associated with Amazon CloudFront origin response event will now be invoked for 4XX and 5XX error status codes, in addition to the currently supported 2XX (success) and 3XX (redirection) status codes.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Using this new capability, you can now use Lambda@Edge to access and override the error responses that CloudFront receives from your origin. You can add headers, issue redirects, or dynamically generate a response for your viewers based on the request attributes. For instance, if your origin is down or a connection cannot be established within the configured timeout value, viewers are currently served an HTTP 5xx error or the static custom error page configured in CloudFront. With this new feature, you can instead redirect viewers to a fail-over location, or generate a customized response within the Lambda function and return a 200 status code (OK). As another example, you can use this functionality to add HSTS security headers on error responses (in addition to 200 status code responses) to improve the overall website security. <br /> </p> 
<p>There is no additional fee for using this new feature. To learn more about Lambda@Edge, visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/">product page</a>. For more information on how to use this new feature, please see the resources below:</p>

<p>You can now assign tags to API Stages in Amazon API Gateway. Using tags, it becomes easier for customers to categorize and track cost allocation for API request invocation and caching. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>A tag is a label that you assign to an API Stage. Each tag consists of a key and a value. You can use tags to organize your resources or to track your AWS costs on a detailed level. For example, when you add a tag of Department: Sales to an API Stage, it shows up in the AWS Billing Management Console as a cost allocation tag. It can then be used for filter and grouping cost and usage using <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-explorer-what-is.html" target="_blank">Cost Explorer</a>. You can assign, remove or list tags using AWS Management Console, AWS CLI or SDKs, and API Gateway REST API.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 19, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>You can now enable content encoding support for API Responses in Amazon API Gateway. Content encoding allows API clients to request content to be compressed before being sent back in the response to an API request. This reduces the amount of data that is sent from API Gateway to API clients and decreases the time it takes to transfer the data. You can enable content encoding in the API definition. You can also set the minimum response size that triggers compression. By default, APIs do not have content encoding support enabled.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 19, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon Elasticsearch Service now supports I3 instances, allowing you to store up to 1.5 petabytes of data in a single Elasticsearch cluster for large log analytics workloads. Using I3 instances, you can store up to 15 terabytes of data in each node and gain up to 3x increase in indexing throughput for less than 50% of the cost of the previous generation I2 instances.</p> 
<p>With petabyte-scale support, you can log a lot more data than before and significantly expand the duration for which you retain data for analytics. In addition, the increased performance of I3 instances (up to 3.3 million IOPS and 16 GB/second of sequential disk throughput) enables you to support more demanding workloads, delivering higher ingestion rates and lower query response times compared to other instance types. Also, with the enhanced networking offered by I3 instances, shard relocation is faster, which reduces the time for cluster updates and instance recovery. You can also enable Amazon Elasticsearch Service’s encryption-at-rest capability on the I3 instances. Furthermore, with the increased storage capacity per node you can do more with fewer instances, which can translate into additional cost savings. To learn more, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/petabyte-scale.html" target="_blank">Amazon Elasticsearch Service Developer Guide</a> and the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/pricing/">Amazon Elasticsearch Service pricing page</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p> AWS is excited to announce immediate availability of the new AWS EU (Paris) Region. Paris joins Ireland, Frankfurt, and London as the fourth AWS Region in Europe and as the 18th region worldwide, bringing the global total of AWS Availability Zones to 49.</p> 
<p> The new Paris Region is currently available for multiple services, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). For a complete list of AWS Regions and services, visit the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">Global Infrastructure page</a>.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 18, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Today, Amazon CloudWatch added support for using <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_terms-and-concepts.html#iam-term-service-linked-role" target="_blank">Service-Linked Roles</a> to setup CloudWatch Alarms with EC2 actions. A service-linked role is a unique type of IAM role that is linked directly to CloudWatch. Service-linked roles are predefined by CloudWatch and include all the permissions that the service requires to call other AWS services on your behalf.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The service-linked role in CloudWatch makes setting up CloudWatch alarms that can terminate, stop, or reboot Amazon EC2 instance easier because you don’t have to manually add the necessary permissions. CloudWatch uses the service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents to perform EC2 alarm actions. The AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents service-linked role trusts the CloudWatch Events service to assume the role and allows to invoke the terminate, stop, or reboot instance actions when called upon by the alarm. You can delete the roles only after first deleting their related resources. This protects your CloudWatch resources because you can't inadvertently remove permission to access the resources. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>To be able to start using&nbsp;service-linked role with CloudWatch Alarms, new permissions are required when calling PutMetricAlarm API. If your IAM users or roles are using CloudWatchFullAccess managed policy, no action is required at your end. If you have custom IAM Policies attached to your Users or Roles, please add the following statement to your policy&nbsp;</p> 
 {
&quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,
&quot;Action&quot;: &quot;iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole&quot;,
&quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-service-role/events.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents*&quot;,

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 14, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>You can now define and require OAutb scopes as part of the method-level authorization when using an Amazon Cognito Authorizer in Amazon API Gateway. This simplifies building APIs that support Cognito Oautb scopes by removing the need to create an AWS Lambda function that performs the authorization. A scope defines the level of access to a resource that an application has permission to. For example, if you have a resource server for storing photos, you could define two scopes: one for read access to the photos and one for write/delete access. You can require applications to request access to your APIs by including a token with one or more scopes embedded inside it. API Gateway will then use it to determine whether the API caller is authorized to access the API.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To get started, create a Cognito Authorizer and set scopes on your methods using the Amazon API Gateway Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs and APIs.

<b id="Introducing_Field-Level_Encryption_on_Amazon_CloudFront"> <a name="Introducing_Field-Level_Encryption_on_Amazon_CloudFront"> Introducing Field-Level Encryption on Amazon CloudFront</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 14, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Starting today, you can use a new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon CloudFront</a> capability called Field-Level Encryption to further enhance the security of sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or personally identifiable information (PII) like social security numbers. CloudFront’s field-level encryption further encrypts sensitive data in an HTTPS form using field-specific encryption keys (which you supply) before a POST request is forwarded to your origin. This ensures that sensitive data can only be decrypted and viewed by certain components or services in your application stack.<br /> </p> 
<p>Many web applications collect sensitive data from users that is then processed by application services running on the origin infrastructure. All these web applications use SSL/TLS encryption between the end user and CloudFront, and between CloudFront and your origin. Your origin could have multiple micro-services that perform critical operations based on user input. For instance, an e-commerce site could collect the purchaser’s credit card number as well as their shipping address to process an order. These orders may be processed by a payment micro-service as well as an order fulfillment service in the application layer. The order fulfillment service doesn't need access to credit card numbers. With field-level encryption, CloudFront’s edge locations can encrypt the credit card data. From that point on, only applications that have the private keys can decrypt the sensitive fields. So the order fulfillment service can only view encrypted credit card numbers, but the payment services can decrypt credit card data.&nbsp;This ensures a higher level of security since even if one of the application services leaks plain text, the credit card data remains cryptographically protected.<br /> </p> 
<p>Field-level encryption is easy to setup. Simply configure the fields that have to be further encrypted by CloudFront using the public keys you specify and you can reduce attack surface for your sensitive data. This makes it easier to meet security compliance requirements such as PCI DSS. Field-level encryption is charged based on the number of requests that need the additional encryption; you pay $0.02 for every 10,000 requests that CloudFront encrypts using field-level encryption in addition to the standard HTTPS request fee; see the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/">pricing page</a> for more details.</p> 
<p>To learn more about how field-level encryption works, see our <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/field-level-encryption.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>. To help you get started, we have written a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-enhance-the-security-of-sensitive-customer-data-by-using-amazon-cloudfront-field-level-encryption/" target="_blank">blog post</a> that includes a sample application deployed using CloudFormation template and detailed walk-through steps for setting up and testing field-level encryption functionality.</p>

<p>The new <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html" target="_blank">CloudWatch Agent</a>, integrated with AWS Systems Manager (SSM) for simplified deployment and management, unifies collecting multi-platform metrics and logs into one agent and enhances the observability of your EC2 instances and virtual machines by collecting in-guest system metrics. Using SSM Run Command or State Manager, you can deploy the agent on EC2 instances, on-premise servers, or hybrid environments, for collecting both Linux and Windows OS metrics and logs, including Windows performance counters and event logs.</p> 
<p>With the agent, you can customize or select from multiple default configurations to collect system-level metrics including disk, memory, and more, with the option to collect at a sub-resource level, such as per disk metrics. Similar to default EC2 metrics, these system-level metrics can be used with CloudWatch alarms for autoscaling instances when available memory is low, dashboarding the p99 statistic of network I/O, and more. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>The agent automatically appends EC2 dimensions for contextual information, such as Auto Scaling Group Name. You can add custom dimensions, configure aggregate metrics, and customize metric resolution, with support down to 1-second resolution. You can also collect both Linux and Windows logs using the same CloudWatch agent. Customers currently using the SSM Agent or EC2Config with CloudWatch can migrate over to the new agent via a SSM migration run command. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>The CloudWatch agent is available in all <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#cw_region" target="_blank">AWS public regions</a>, with AWS GovCloud and China regions to follow.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 12, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Today AWS Direct Connect has landed sites in four cities – Miami, Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo and London. With global access enabled for AWS Direct Connect, these sites can reach AWS resources in any global AWS region. In the US, Equinix MI1, Miami brings the total AWS Direct Connect sites in the country to 29. In the AWS Management Console, Miami will be found under its home region of US East (Northern Virginia). In South America, Equinix RJ2, Rio de Janeiro, marks the first AWS Direct Connect site in Brazil outside of Sao Paulo. The AT Tokyo Chuo Data Center site is the second AWS Direct Connect site in Tokyo and third in Japan. In the UK, Telehouse North Two is the third site in the London area that will be found in the console under EU West (London) region.</p> 
<p>Customers in these cities can now establish a dedicated network connection from their premise to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections. Connections are always made to a particular Direct Connect location, and can run at either 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps, or work with a partner to connect at speeds less than 1G.&nbsp;</p>

<b id="Amazon_WorkMail_Releases_an_Administrative_SDK_and_Enables_AWS_CloudTrail_Integration"> <a name="Amazon_WorkMail_Releases_an_Administrative_SDK_and_Enables_AWS_CloudTrail_Integration"> Amazon WorkMail Releases an Administrative SDK and Enables AWS CloudTrail Integration</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 12, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Today, Amazon WorkMail released two new features: an administrative SDK and AWS CloudTrail integration. <br /> </p> 
<p>With the administrative SDK, you can natively integrate WorkMail with your existing services. The SDK enables programmatic user, email group, and meeting room or equipment resource management through API calls. This means your existing IT service management tools, workflows, and third party applications can automate WorkMail migration and management tasks. For example, your existing on-boarding workflow can programmatically create new WorkMail user accounts every time an employee joins your organization with just a few lines of code. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>WorkMail now integrates with CloudTrail. CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure including activity from the WorkMail console and calls made to the WorkMail administrative API. This event history simplifies security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The WorkMail administrative SDK is part of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk">AWS SDK</a>, so you can <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html" target="_blank">get started</a> using the tools you are already familiar with. It is available in Java, Python, Go, Java Script, .NET, PHP, and Ruby. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to configure and enable it, see the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/">AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a>. These features are available today in all <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/">AWS Regions</a>&nbsp;where WorkMail is available. There is no charge for WorkMail API calls, and CloudTrail allows you to view and download recent account activity to create, modify, and delete operations of supported services free of charge. If you use S3 with CloudTrail, charges apply based on your usage. Visit <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing/">CloudTrail Pricing</a> for details. &nbsp;</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 12, 2017</span> </p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/">AWS CodePipeline</a> now supports deployments to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">Amazon Elastic Container Service</a> (Amazon ECS) and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">AWS Fargate</a>. This makes it easy to create a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-delivery/">continuous delivery</a> pipeline for container-based applications.</p> 
<p>When you push a code change, AWS CodePipeline automatically calls the specified services to create your Docker image, run tests, and update your running containers. For example, you can create a pipeline where a code change in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/">AWS CodeCommit</a> triggers <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/">AWS CodeBuild</a> to build a new image and upload it to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">Amazon Elastic Container Registry</a>. CodePipeline then automatically instructs Amazon ECS to deploy the updated containers onto your managed cluster with Amazon ECS or AWS Fargate. Additionally, CodePipeline <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/product-integrations/">integrates with many third party CI/CD services</a>, so you can use a pipeline with your existing tools.</p> 
<p>For a step-by-step tutorial, see this use case in the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-cd-pipeline.html" target="_blank">Amazon ECS Developer Guide</a>.</p> 
<p>This integration is available in the US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), US West (N. California), Canada (Central), EU (London), EU (Ireland), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), and Asia Pacific (Seoul) Regions.

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 11, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Last year, we announced support for asynchronously invoking AWS Lambda functions from Amazon Aurora with MySQL compatibility via an in-built stored procedure. Starting with version 1.16, we are extending this feature to be able to able to synchronously invoke Lambda functions. Further, we have implemented both the synchronous and asynchronous versions of the feature using native functions, allowing Lambda functions to be invoked from within queries.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers or worrying about scalability. Lambda integration allows you to extend the capabilities of the Amazon Aurora MySQL database and invoke external applications to act upon data changes. For example, you can create a Lambda function that sends emails to customers whenever their address in the database is updated.</p> 
<p>Use the native function lambda_sync when you must know the result of the execution before moving on to another action. Use the native function lambda_async, or the existing stored procedure mysql.lambda_async, when you do not need to know the result of the execution before moving on to another action. You can read more in the Amazon Aurora MySQL documentation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are excited to announce that Amazon CloudWatch Alarms now supports alarming when any M out of N datapoints cross the alarm threshold. A datapoint is the value of a metric for a given metric aggregation period i.e. if you use one minute as an aggregation period for a metric, then there will be one datapoint every minute. With this launch, you can now create a CloudWatch alarm that alerts you when M out of N datapoints of a metric are above your predefined threshold, such as three out of five times in any given five minutes interval or two out of six times in a thirty minutes interval. When any M out of N datapoints are below your threshold in an interval, the alarm will be in OK state. Please note that the M datapoints out of N datapoints in an interval can be of any order and does not need to be consecutive. Consequently, you can now get alerted even when the spikes in your metrics are intermittent over an interval.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>This feature gives you the flexibility to configure CloudWatch alarms in ways that fit your use cases. You can create alarms that alerts you even if one datapoint is above your threshold or only when all the datapoints in an interval have breached the threshold or any configuration between those use cases. To create alarms with this feature, please visit Amazon CloudWatch console. The PutMetricAlarm API has also been updated with a new a parameter, DatapointsToAlarm, that defines the number of datapoints that must be breaching to trigger the alarm. There is no additional cost to use this feature.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 7, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>The AppStream 2.0 agent is software that runs on your streaming instances and enables application streaming. Before this, agent updates were included with new base image releases provided by AWS. To use the latest agent software with your streaming instances, you had to rebuild your images using new base images. Now, you can enable your images to always use the latest version of the AppStream 2.0 agent. Enabling automatic updates for the AppStream 2.0 agent helps ensure that your streaming instances always include the latest features, performance improvements, and security updates available from AWS.<br /> </p> 
<p>To enable automatic updates, create a new image from the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/base-image-version-history.html" target="_blank">December 7th 2017 base image</a>, or any base image created after this date. When you create a new image, the <b>Always use latest agent version</b>&nbsp;option is selected by default. When this option is selected, any new image builder or fleet instance that is launched from your image will always use the latest AppStream 2.0 agent version. You can only enable automatic updates for the AppStream 2.0 agent when you first create an image from the image builder. If you deselect this option, your image will use the agent version you selected when you launched the image builder. To learn more, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/agent-software-versions.html" target="_blank">Amazon AppStream 2.0 Agent Version History</a>.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 6, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>Amazon Pinpoint Extensions (Public Beta) now enables customers: 1) to integrate new channels such as social messenger and in-app messaging channels, with Pinpoint segmentation and campaign management capabilities and 2) to enrich campaign segmentation and messaging during campaign execution by defining AWS Lambda functions to run on each campaign execution.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Using the DELIVERY mode, customers can extend Pinpoint messaging channels and bring currently un-supported channels owned and maintained by them directly into a campaign. This enables messaging scenarios across channels managed under Pinpoint (mobile push, email, and SMS), and channels owned by customers such as in-widget messaging or in-product messaging. To learn more about Pinpoint Extensions DELIVERY mode click <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/channels-custom.html" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Customers can use FILTER mode to tailor Pinpoint campaigns by enabling modification of the campaign's segment at campaign execution. This mode enables messaging scenarios on existing push, email, and SMS where customers can define sub-segmentation criteria or enhance the campaign message using attribute data added to endpoint in real-time using the Lambda function.

<b id="Elasticsearch_6.0_now_available_on_Amazon_Elasticsearch_Service"> <a name="Elasticsearch_6.0_now_available_on_Amazon_Elasticsearch_Service"> Elasticsearch 6.0 now available on Amazon Elasticsearch Service</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 6, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Elasticsearch 6.0 and Kibana 6.0 on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/">Amazon Elasticsearch Service</a>. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/what-is-elasticsearch/">Elasticsearch</a> is a popular open source analytics and search engine for log analytics, full text search, application monitoring, and more. Amazon Elasticsearch Service delivers Elasticsearch’s easy-to-use APIs and real-time capabilities along with the availability, scalability, and security required by production workloads.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>When creating an Amazon Elasticsearch Service domain, you can now select Elasticsearch version 6.0. All Amazon Elasticsearch Service domains using Elasticsearch 6.0 are bundled with Kibana 6.0, the corresponding version of the open-source visualization tool. </p> 
<p>Elasticsearch 6.0 on Amazon Elasticsearch Service is powered by Apache Lucene 7.0.1 and offers several enhancements over the Elasticsearch 5.5 stack including:</p> 
<li><u>Improved efficiency of sparse fields:</u> Doc-values provide powerful columnar data store capabilities, but previously, Elasticsearch reserved a storage slot for every field in every column. With this release, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/minimize-index-storage-size-elasticsearch-6-0">sparsely populated fields</a> consume far less disk space and make more efficient use of file system caching.</li> 
<li><u>Reduced disk consumption:</u> The “_all” field made it easy to get started with Elasticsearch by concatenating all values together, but it created a huge amount of duplicate data. The “_all” field is <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping-all-field.html">deprecated in Elasticsearch 6.0</a>, which can significantly reduce disk usage.</li> 
<li><u>Index sorting and faster query times:</u> You can now optimize Elasticsearch indexes to store documents on disk in a <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/index-sorting-elasticsearch-6-0">specific order</a>, which can allow queries to be returned more efficiently.&nbsp;</li> 
<li><u>Better query resource management:</u> A new control has been added to limit the maximum number of concurrent shard requests that can be served from a single search. This change intentionally slows down very broad searches and reduces their impact on other users.&nbsp;</li> 
<li><u>Kibana 6.0 accessibility improvements: </u>Colors throughout Kibana have been redesigned to have appropriate contrast settings for users with <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/making-kibana-accessible">color blindness</a>.&nbsp;</li> 
<li><u>New experimental Kibana query language (Kuery): </u>The default search feature in Kibana is a simple query string, which limits the application’s utility. Kuery is a new query language designed to <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/building-a-better-search-experience-in-kibana">simplify Kibana’s search experience</a> and provide a foundation for powerful new features like named functions and scripted fields.</li> 
<p>Elasticsearch 6.0 on Amazon Elasticsearch Service is now available in 14 regions globally: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), US West (N. California), Canada (Central), South America (Sao Paulo), EU (Ireland), EU (London), EU (Frankfurt), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), and Asia Pacific (Mumbai) regions.</p>

<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 5, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>AWS is announcing three new enhancements that make it easier to get started with Amazon Inspector and to run security assessments. You can now automatically configure Inspector assessments through AWS CloudFormation as your Amazon EC2 instances are deployed. Next, you can now select an Amazon Linux Amazon Machine Image (AMI) pre-installed with the Inspector Agent and run security assessments without having to manually install the agent. Finally, Inspector now uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service-linked roles, which means you can leave the registration and management of IAM roles for Inspector to us.</p> 
<p><b>AWS CloudFormation support:</b> Starting today, you can create Inspector resource groups, assessment targets, and assessment templates using CloudFormation templates. This allows you to automatically set up security assessments for your EC2 instances as they are deployed. In your CloudFormation template, you can also bootstrap installation of the Inspector Agent on EC2 instances by using <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_installing-uninstalling-agents.html">agent installation commands</a> in either <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-init.html">AWS::CloudFormation::Init</a> or <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html">EC2 user data</a>. Alternatively, you can create EC2 instances in your CloudFormation template using an AMI with the Inspector Agent pre-installed. For more information on CloudFormation, see AWS CloudFormation <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">website</a>.</p> 
<p><b>Amazon Linux AMI pre-installed with the Amazon Inspector Agent:</b> You can now choose to launch your EC2 instances using an Amazon Linux 2017.09 AMI that is pre-installed with the Inspector Agent. This AMI, now available from the EC2 Console and the AWS Marketplace, enables you to quickly deploy a fleet of EC2 instances that are ready to run Inspector assessments. The AMI comes pre-installed with the Inspector Agent and is provided and supported by Amazon Web Services at no additional charge. You can learn more about the AMI on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B077W1VR7G">AWS Marketplace</a>.</p> 
<p><b>Service-linked roles: </b>Amazon Inspector now uses IAM service-linked roles to describe EC2 instances and tags for an assessment target, so you no longer need to create and register IAM roles for Inspector. Starting today, a new service-linked role will be created for new customers when they start using Inspector, and for existing customers when they create a new assessment target or assessment template. The Inspector service-linked role is managed by us, so you don’t have to worry about inadvertently revoking permissions required by Inspector. In the future, when Inspector launches new features that require additional IAM permissions, we will update the Inspector service-linked role and notify you of the change. If and when you no longer want to use Inspector, you can delete the Inspector service-linked role via the IAM console. For more information on service-linked roles, see IAM <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<b id="Amazon_IoT_Rules_Engine_Now_Supports_Error_Actions"> <a name="Amazon_IoT_Rules_Engine_Now_Supports_Error_Actions"> Amazon IoT Rules Engine Now Supports Error Actions</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 5, 2017</span> </p> 
<p>You can now harden your IoT applications by configuring a back-up action to perform in the event your primary rule action(s) fail. Amazon IoT Rules Engine also attaches the error information to the message payload affected. You can use this feature to ensure that message data is handled in context of the error or routed to a back-up resource. Error Actions may be used to handle a range of user and service error conditions such as insufficiently provisioned downstream services, or unavailability of services.</p> 
<p>Amazon IoT Rules Engine is a component of AWS IoT Core, a managed cloud service that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices. IoT Rules Engine evaluates inbound messages published into IoT Core and transforms and delivers them to another device or a cloud service, based on business rules you define. A rule can apply to data from one or many devices, can take one or many actions in parallel, and route messages to AWS endpoints including AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon S3, Amazon Machine Learning, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Cloud Watch, and Amazon Elastic Search Service with built-in Kibana integration. External endpoints can be reached using AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, and Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS).&nbsp;</p>

<b id="Amazon_Route_53_Releases_Auto_Naming_API_for_Service_Name_Management_and_Discovery"> <a name="Amazon_Route_53_Releases_Auto_Naming_API_for_Service_Name_Management_and_Discovery"> Amazon Route 53 Releases Auto Naming API for Service Name Management and Discovery</a> </b> 
<p> Posted On: <span class="date">Dec 5, 2017</span> </p> 
<p> Beginning today, you can use the Amazon Route 53 Auto Naming API to automate the registration of microservices in DNS. The new API simplifies the management of DNS names and health checks for microservices that run on top of AWS when microservices scale up and down.</p> 
<p> Previously, to keep track of the names and locations of microservice fleets that scale up and down in real time, you had two choices. Either you had to maintain custom scripts to directly control DNS records and health checks, or you had to deploy and manage third-party software. Amazon Route 53 Auto Naming abstracts away the complexity of managing DNS and health checks by providing a set of APIs for service naming configuration and service instance management.</p> 
<p> Now, when a new service instance is registered, you can access it by making a simple DNS query for the service name. Amazon Route 53 Auto Naming uses the multivalue answer routing type, which returns up to eight records in each response to a DNS query. If you defined a health check for the service, Amazon Route 53 returns only the records associated with healthy endpoints. You can also verify the health status of service instances via API.</p>
